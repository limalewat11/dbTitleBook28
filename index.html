She lives in the pristine woodlands of Montana.Chapter One<br><br> Wind whistled into the big black van, whipping Tanner Richards' hair across his forehead as he drove. Squinting at the gravel road through the brown strands drifting over his eyes, he hauled in a deep breath of pine-scented air. Five years ago he'd agonized over his decision to sell his accounting firm and move to Crystal Falls, Oregon. He'd given up a six-figure annual income with no assurance that he could even find a job in this area. Crazy, really. Looking back on it now, though, he was glad that he'd come. Being a deliveryman wasn't as prestigious as working in his former chosen profession, but he made enough money to provide a good life for his kids, and he truly enjoyed the occupation. Having a rural route suited him. He was required to make fewer stops than he would have been in town, which equated to shorter workdays and more time in the evening to be with his children. And he'd made a lot of friends. Folks around here were more congenial than they were in larger towns.<br><br> As he rounded a curve in the country road, Tanner saw Tuck Malloy's house. Sadness punched into him. For three years running, he'd often stopped there to visit at the end of his workday, and he'd enjoyed a lot of cold ones on the porch with his elderly friend. Now the windows reflected the darkness of an empty structure. A For Sale sign rode high on the front gate. It had appeared nearly a month ago.<br><br> Tanner had considered calling the Realtor to learn what had happened to the property owner after his calls to Tuck went unanswered, but he really didn't want to know. Tuck had been a crusty old codger and eighty years young, as he'd been fond of saying. Unexpected things could happen to people that age. A heart attack, maybe, or a stroke. Tuck liked that piece of ground, and he would never have left voluntarily. He'd said so more than once. Tanner figured the old fellow was dead. Otherwise why would his place be up for sale?<br><br> Tanner pulled over and stopped outside the hurricane fence for a moment, a habit he had developed since the home had been vacated. He trailed his gaze over the front porch, now devoid of the comfortable Adirondack chairs where he had once sat with Tuck to chat. Recalling the old man's recalcitrant dog, he smiled. Rip. Tanner hoped the blue heeler had found a good home. He'd been a handful and was probably difficult to place.<br><br> Damn, he missed them both. With a sigh Tanner eased the van back onto the road. He had only one more delivery before he could call it a day. Maybe he could mow the lawn and do some weeding before his kids got home. Tori, now eight, had dance class after school today, and Michael, eleven and getting gangly, had baseball practice. Since his wife's death, Tanner had been a single dad, and not a day went by that he wasn't grateful for his mom's help. She got his kids off to the bus stop each morning and chauffeured them to most of their activities, which took a huge load of responsibility off his shoulders.<br><br> Tanner delivered the last parcel of the day. After he dropped the van off at Courier Express, he needed to pick up some groceries. Milk, for one thing. Tori wouldn't eat breakfast without it. And if he didn't get bread, he'd have no fixings for his lunch tomorrow.<br><br> His cell phone, which rode atop a sticky mat on the dash, chimed with a message notification. Tanner grabbed the device and glanced at the screen to make sure the text wasn't from his mother. She never contacted him during work hours unless it was urgent. When he read the name of the sender, his hand froze on the steering wheel. Tuck Malloy? He almost went off the road into a ditch. How could that be? The old coot was dead. Wasn't he?<br><br> Tanner pulled over onto a wide spot, shifted into park, and stared at his phone. The message was definitely from Tuck. They had exchanged cell numbers months ago, and Tuck had occasionally texted to ask Tanner to pick up items he needed from the store. It hadn't been a bother for Tanner. There was a mom-and-pop grocery not that far away, and Tuck's house was on the road he always took back to town.<br><br> He swiped the screen. A smile curved his lips as he read the message. "I fell off the damned porch. Busted my arm, some ribs, and had to get a hip replacement. Now I'm doing time in assisted living, and the bitch that runs the place won't let me have my beer or chew. Can you buy me some of both and sneak it in to me? I'll pay you back."<br><br> Tanner had been picturing the old fart in heaven, sitting on an Adirondack chair with a six-pack of Pabst Blue Ribbon and a spittoon within easy reach. It was unsettling to think someone was dead and then receive a text from him.<br><br> He tapped out a response. "I don't mind bringing you things. My kids have activities this afternoon, so I'm not pressed for time. But I don't want to get in trouble for delivering forbidden substances. My job could be on the line."<br><br> Tuck replied, "No trouble. Just put it inside a box and pretend it's something I ordered. If I get caught, I'll never tell who brought me the stuff. Sorry I can't just call, but these nurses have sharp ears and I got no privacy."<br><br> Tanner grinned. He trusted the old man not to reveal his name if it came down to that. And he truly did sympathize with Tuck's feelings of deprivation. Just because a man was eighty shouldn't mean he no longer had a right to indulge his habits. Staying at an assisted living facility was costly, and in Tanner's estimation, the residents should be able to do whatever they liked in their apartments as long as their physicians didn't object.<br><br> He texted, "Do you have your doctor's permission to drink and chew?"<br><br> Tuck replied, "Well, he ain't said I shouldn't. I been drinking and chewing my whole life. I'm eighty. What can he say, that my pleasures might kill me?"<br><br> Tanner chuckled. He agreed to deliver the requested items and asked Tuck for the address. He was surprised to learn the facility was in Mystic Creek. Tanner didn't cover that area, and it was a thirty-minute drive to get there. He mulled over the fact that he would be driving for more than an hour round-trip in a Courier Express van to run a personal errand. He'd also be using company fuel, which didn't seem right, but he supposed he could top off the tank to make up for that. He could also adjust his time sheet so he wouldn't be paid for an hour he hadn't actually worked.<br><br> Whistling tunelessly, Tanner made the drive to Mystic Creek. He hadn't yet gotten over this way. The curvy two-lane highway offered beautiful scenery, tree-covered mountain peaks, craggy buttes, and silvery flashes of a river beyond the stands of ponderosa pine. To his surprise, he saw a turnoff to Crystal Falls-the actual waterfall, not the town-and he made a mental note to bring the kids up sometime to see it. They'd get a kick out of that. Maybe they could spread a blanket on the riverbank and have a picnic.<br><br> Once in Mystic Creek, a quaint and well-kept little town, he found a grocery store on East Main called Flagg's Market, where he purchased two six-packs of beer and a whole roll of Copenhagen for his elderly friend. In the van he always carried extra box flats. He assembled a medium-size one, stuck what he now thought of as the contraband into it, and taped the flaps closed. With a ballpoint pen, he wrote Tuck's full name, the address, and the apartment number on a Courier Express mailing slip, which he affixed to the cardboard. Done. Now he'd just drive to the facility and make the delivery. The rest would be up to Tuck.<br><br> Mystic Creek Retirement Living was in a large brick building with two wings that angled out toward the front parking lot. The back of the facility bordered Mystic Creek, which bubbled and chattered cheerfully between banks lined with greenery, weeping willows, and pines. He suspected the residents spent a lot of time on the rear lawns, enjoying the sounds of rushing water and birdsong. If he were living there, that's what he would do.<br><br> Striding across the parking area with the box in his arms, Tanner began to feel nervous. What if someone questioned him? Pausing outside the double glass doors, he took a calming breath and then pushed inside. A middle-aged woman with red hair sat at the front desk. She fixed her friendly-looking blue gaze on Tanner's face and smiled.<br><br> "You're new," she observed. "Brian usually delivers our Courier Express packages."<br><br> Tanner nodded. "Uh, yeah. Just helping out today. I've got a package for Tucker Malloy, apartment twenty-three."<br><br> She pointed to a wide hallway to the left of the counter. "About halfway down on the right."<br><br> Tanner circled her workstation and moved past her. When he reached Tuck's room, he knocked on the door and called, "Delivery. Courier Express."<br><br> He heard a shuffling sound, and seconds later, Tuck opened the door, flashing a broad grin. "Come in, come in," he said in a booming voice. "Must be those shoes and pants I ordered."<br><br> Tanner winked at his old friend as he made his way through the doorway. As he set the box on the living room floor, he noticed that Tuck held a walking cane in his left hand. After closing the door, he walked with a limp as he crossed the tiny kitchen. Tanner guessed the old fellow's hip still pained him. Otherwise he looked the same, tall and lean with slightly stooped shoulders. His blue eyes held the same merry twinkle. Deep smile creases bracketed his mouth. His hair, still thick, was mostly silver, but a few streaks of brown remained to indicate its original color.<br><br> "It's good to see you," Tanner told him. "When your place went up for sale, I tried to call you several times and left you voice mails. Then I couldn't get through anymore. I figured you'd passed away and your phone had been retired to a drawer."<br><br> "Hell, no. I'm too ornery to kick the bucket just yet. Not to say it's an outlandish thing for you to think. At eighty, I don't buy green bananas anymore. They're a risky investment."<br><br> Tanner laughed. Tuck bent to open the box, plucked a can of beer from one six-pack yoke, and offered it up. With regret, Tanner declined. "I can't stay, Tuck. My kids will be getting home in a couple of hours."<br><br> Tuck straightened slowly, as if stiffness had settled into his spine. On his right arm he wore a red elbow-high cast that extended down over the back of his hand to his knuckles and encircled his thumb. "That's a shame. I miss our bullshit sessions."<br><br> "Me, too," Tanner confessed. "I'll try to come back for a visit when I have more time." He bent to lift the six-packs from the box. "Where you planning to hide these?"<br><br> "In my boots and coat pockets. My beer'll be warm, but that's better'n nothin'."<br><br> Tanner carried the twelve-ounce containers to the closet, opened the doors, and began slipping cans into the old man's footwear. Tuck hobbled in with the roll of Copenhagen, which Tanner broke open before stuffing the rounds into shirt and jacket pockets. He couldn't help but grin when everything was hidden. With a wink at Tuck, he whispered, "They'll never know."<br><br> "Damn, I hope not," Tuck said. "My Pabst Blue Ribbon helps me relax at night. Without it I toss and turn. When I complain, the damned administrator just scowls at me and says to ask my doctor for sleeping pills. Like that'd be any better for my health? Hell, no. I like my beer."<br><br> Tanner stared at him. "What are you going to do with the empties?"<br><br> Tuck winked. "They got a resident laundry room down the hall with two tall trash cans. I'll sneak 'em down there and bury 'em real deep under other garbage."<br><br> "I see no harm in you enjoying your beer of an evening unless your doctor has forbidden it," Tanner said. "You'd tell me if that were the case. Right?"<br><br> "Wouldn't have asked you if he had. I don't have a death wish. I just want my damn beers and chew. The doc knows I have three beers a night and he never said nothin'. Of course, it's a different fella here. Their Dr. Fancy Pants might not make allowances for a man's personal pleasures."<br><br> "That sucks." Tanner had never stopped to consider how many liberties people could lose when they grew old. "But it's temporary. Right? Once you've healed, you can live somewhere else again." Tanner remembered the real estate sign on Tuck's front gate. "You do get to leave here, I hope."<br><br> "The doctors are sayin' that I shouldn't live alone again." He shrugged. "At my age, that's how it goes, with other people decidin' what's best for you."<br><br> "I'm sorry to hear you can't live alone anymore." Tanner sincerely meant that. "Maybe you can make arrangements for some kind of in-home care. If you can afford that, of course."<br><br> "I'm workin' on it. I got plenty of money saved back, so I had Crystal get me another house here in Mystic Creek. She found a nice little place on ten acres just outside town. It's a short drive from her salon, and she's already livin' there. The house was made over for an old lady in a wheelchair, but she passed away. Crystal thinks it'll suit my needs, and she's willin' to stay there to look after me."<br><br> Tanner nodded. "That sounds ideal. Ten acres isn't quite as much land as you had in Crystal Falls, but at least you'll still have elbow room." For most of his life, Tuck had been a rancher. Tanner doubted he would be happy living inside the city limits on a small lot. "You're blessed to have a granddaughter who loves you so much."<br><br> "I am, for certain. She's a sweet girl."<br><br> "Where's Bolt? At the new place?"<br><br> "Nope. Crystal has enough to do without fussin' over a horse. I had her find a place to board him. When I'm able, I'll bring him home and take care of him."<br><br> Tanner walked back into the living room, stabbing his fingers under his belt to neaten the tuck of his brown uniform shirt. "I sure wish I could stay for a while, but I've got to run."</p><h2>Spoiled Brats</h2><p>Twenty years ago, Barney the Dinosaur told the nation's children they were special.

They escape from the hammock to do some canoeing, pick blackberries, and enjoy a picnic. Carl even plays a little baseball! That night, Mom and Dad wonder why the two are so tired &#x2013; little do they know that Carl and Madeleine have been busy exploring all that a summer vacation on the lake has to offer.</p><p>Told mainly through Alexandra Day's gorgeous oil paintings, this summertime romp will make readers long to bring Carl along on their own vacations!</p></p><p><b>Alexandra Day</b> is the author and illustrator of <i>Good Dog, Carl</i> and the rest of the beloved Carl books, including <i>Carl Goes Shopping</i>, <i>Carl's Christmas</i>, <i>Carl's Birthday</i> and <i>Carl's Snowy Afternoon</i>. The Darlings' own dog, a Rottweiler named Toby, was the original model for the main character of <i>Good Dog, Carl</i>. Since then, two other Darling Rottweilers have posed as Carl in the sequels: the late Arambarri, who was named for one of the Darlings' favorite jai alai players; and Zabala, who currently moonlights as an Our Best Friend therapy dog, visiting hospitals to cheer patients.PreSchool-Grade 2&#x2014;Young Madeleine and her loyal pup, Carl, are up to their same tricks in this charming addition to a whimsical series. Mom and Dad are busy preparing the summer cabin for company later in the evening, and they leave the pair in a hammock on the back porch. Immediately upon hearing Mom say, "You two have a good nap so you'll be ready to go see the fireworks tonight," Carl and his devoted sidekick decide to go exploring. It is here that the text stops, for the most part. Richly detailed and beautifully hued illustrations depict the duo's adventures: a canoe ride that includes a stop by a flowering lily pad; a romp through wild blackberry bushes where they come upon a highly protective mama skunk; a stop at the playground where Carl joins a baseball game, and more. They return to the hammock just in time to be "awakened" by Mom. Madeleine falls asleep in her father's arms during the vibrantly depicted fireworks show, leaving her parents to wonder why she was so tired after having had such a long nap.

Africans work with Australians in India. Koreans plant churches in London and Los Angeles. But globalization also creates challenges for crosscultural tension and misunderstandings, as different cultures have conflicting assumptions about leadership values and styles. Missiologist James E. Plueddemann presents a roadmap for crosscultural leadership development in the global church. With keen understanding of current research on cultural dynamics, he integrates theology with leadership theory to apply biblical insights to practical issues in world mission. Savvy discernment of diverse cultural underpinnings allows multicultural teams to work together with mutual respect for more effective ministry. The author shows how leaders can grow from an individualistic egocentric practice of leadership to a more global-centric approach. The future of the global church depends on effective multicultural leadership. God has called people from various contexts to minister and lead in every land for the sake of the gospel. Whether you are teaching English in China, directing information technology in Africa or pastoring a multiethnic church in North America, discover how you can better work and lead across cultures.</p><p><strong>James E. Plueddemann</strong> (Ph.D., Michigan State) is professor and chair of the mission and evangelism department at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Illinois. He previously served as international director of SIM (Serving in Mission) and spent many years as a missionary in Nigeria, where he was director of the Christian education department for the Evangelical Church of West Africa."In <em>Leading Across Cultures</em>, James Plueddemann gives the Global Church a toolbox for crafting leadership for cross-cultural ministry. He writes from personal experience, important cultural research, and missiological and biblical insights. The result is a guide for mission practitioners and a textbook for contextualizing leadership." (Marcus W. Dean, EMQ, July 2010)<br><br>"Professor Jim Plueddemann has succeeded in achieving a rare feat. He has written a book that is scholarly and practical, biblical and contextual. Professor Plueddemann draws from his long and rich experience of leadership in Christian ministry and scholarship both in the West and crossculturally. He offers illustrations from every continent. He provides clear boundaries with his definition of <em>missionary</em> and <em>leadership.</em> One of the great strengths of this book is the assumption that all leaders from all cultures can learn from one another. No culture is perfect. As God's children endowed with the Holy Spirit, we can certainly benefit from each others' experience and walk with God. I highly recommend this book to any leader who is involved in crosscultural ministry. That is every leader because of the global context in which we live." (Bulus Y. Galadima,&nbsp;provost and associate professor, Jos ECWA Theological Seminary, Nigeria)<br><br>"This book is a rare combination of insights that draw from the biblical disciplines as well as social science research. Jim Plueddemann's insights, blended with a lifetime of global leadership experiences, enrich all of us with new knowledge and practices that contribute uniquely to building the church of Jesus Christ. Readers will be enriched with new understandings and possibilities for more culturally sensitive global leadership." (Duane Elmer, G. W. Aldeen Professor of International Studies and Mission, Trinity International University, and author of Cross-Cultural Conflict and Cross-Cultural Servanthood)<br><br>"In an increasingly interconnected world, the need to understand cultural differences in leadership is paramount if the global church is to take the glorious gospel 'from everywhere to everywhere.' Leading in global missions today requires wisdom from above coupled with a new set of assumptions humbly prescribed by a handful of pilgrims who joyfully serve in God's global harvest. In this work, Dr. James Plueddemann takes us on a journey to interact with him and other pilgrims found in a variety of cultural settings whose experiences will enrich the reader who seeks to play a significant role in the globalized church." (Am�rico Saavedra, executive director, APOYO-HCJB Global, Latin America)<br><br>"I found this an extremely helpful book and one that was screaming to be written--from my vantage point as a facilitator of crosscultural competency training seminars. I have both used others' adaptations as well as developed my own material of the concepts researched by Geert Hofstede as well as Fons Trompenaars and Charles Hampden-Turner. Well-written vignettes illustrate crosscultural leadership concepts and difficulties so very aptly that my facilitation of these seminars will be enhanced by focusing not on presenting the basic concepts, but on leading discussions on how they can be applied to specific situations represented by the participants. "The results of gleaning leadership principles from different cultures and applying them can enhance a person's leadership effectiveness, because the world has changed and there are few, if any, purely monocultural situations. As Plueddemann writes, 'We need each other. We need to listen to each other and blend an unchanging gospel into a new missiology that is in tune with an unpredictable, ever-changing cultural context.' "But we also need to tread gently (which is why this book needs to be read) because situations are not always what they appear. After having studied and worked in America for ten years, I returned to India to serve under a Canadian missionary who had been there for thirty years. He communicated with me as though I was an Indian and I with him as though he was a Canadian, while in truth he had become more Indian than me and I had become more North American than him. Now working in a U.S. university, I am surrounded by colleagues from all over the world, and we are all together part of a global ecology. To quote Plueddemann, 'Multicultural leaders must be flexible, able to shift their leadership approach according to expectations of the situation. He or she must not only be proficient in several leadership models, but must also learn to work comfortably under leaders with very different cultural expectations of followers.' "This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to influence others in crosscultural and multicultural situations, and as a dean, I would recommend it to all those who teach in higher education because of the diverse students we have in our classrooms." (Junias Venugopal, dean, Seminary School of Missions, Columbia International University)<br><br>"Plueddemann paints powerful pictures of how our 'low context' images of leadership blind us to the expectations and practices of people living and leading in 'high context' environments. He then guides the reader to think and reflect on how biblical principles both challenge and affirm our respective values. Following the same practice, he critiques the contemporary literature on 'power distance' and 'individualism/collectivism.' This is an important theological reflection on contemporary leadership theory (GLOBE) and its relevance for crosscultural Christian ministry." (Sherwood Lingenfelter, provost and senior vice president, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"<em>Leading Across Cultures</em> is one of the most informative books that I have read on the subject of crosscultural leadership. It integrates sociological data with praxis, experience with theory and, finally, actual life stories with optimal patterns of what crosscultural leadership would look like in given contexts. It is must-reading for those who intend to seriously engage in leadership in the globalized mission/church context of the twenty-first century." (David Tai-Woong Lee, director, Global Leadership Focus, Korea)<br><br>"This book carefully integrates theory and reality in contemporary global Christian leadership. It is an invaluable tool in the hands of a leader who desires to impact our multicultural world globally and contextually. It equips, inspires, challenges and enlarges the leader's vision to a higher plane of impacting others. It frees the leader from a monocultural grid to a contemporary multicultural grid. The book integrates helpful ideas of the past with the present and brings our future world reality closer to the present on solid theological grounding." (Dr. David K. Ngaruiya, acting vice chancellor and head of the intercultural studies department, Nairobi International School of Theology)<br><br>"I read and reread Plueddemann's book <em>Leading Across Cultures</em> with extreme excitement. I can say this book has transformed my thinking and understanding on intercultural leadership of global missions. I am thankful for his contribution and efforts not only for readers from the West, but also for the global church and overall global missionary endeavor. Therefore, I hope this book will transform the understanding of many, many mission leaders, pastors and missionary trainers. It will also bring new ways of doing missions for those who are ready to change and truly want to expand God's kingdom in missions and church planting in different cultures. Reading this book with conviction will bring humility and harmony among missionary teams, inspire for action, and give direction and vision for new ways of doing missions in crosscultural contexts." (Dr. Desta Langena, director, Kale Heywet School of Missions, Ethiopia)<br><br>"For years Jim's example and principles have guided me in my leading and teaching in Africa. I have tasted first-fruits of the great joy and fruitfulness I see in his life. Now in this engaging book, Jim shares his practical insights from forty years of leadership experiences and research with you. He has led influential Nigerian, American and international organizations; personally mentored leaders in fifty countries; and integrated research from business, anthropology, education and intercultural studies. Read well and lead well!" (Rev. Steven Rasmussen, Ph.D., founding director, Training East African Ministers, and lecturer, Nairobi Evangelical Graduate School of Theology)</p><h2>An Irish Country Girl: A Novel (Irish Country Books, 4)</h2><p><p>Readers of Patrick Taylor's books know Mrs. Kinky Kincaid as the unflappable housekeeper who looks after two frequently frazzled doctors in the colourful Irish village of Ballybucklebo. She is a trusted fixture in the lives of those around her, and it often seems as though Kinky has always been there.</p><p>Nothing could be farther from the truth.</p><p>Some forty-odd years before and many miles to the south, the girl who would someday be Kinky Kincaid was Maureen O'Hanlon, a farmer's daughter growing up in the emerald hills and glens of County Cork. A precocious girl on the cusp of womanhood, Maureen has a head full of dreams, a heart open to romance, and something more: a gift for seeing beyond the ordinary into the mystic realm of fairies, spirits, and even the dreaded Banshee, whose terrifying wail she first hears on a snowy night in 1922....</p><p>As she grows into a young woman, Maureen finds herself torn between love and her fondest aspirations, for the future is a mystery even for one blessed with the sight. Encountering both joy and sorrow, Maureen at last finds herself on the road to Ballybucklebo&#x2015;and the strong and compassionate woman she was always destined to become.</p><p><i>An Irish Country Girl</i> is another captivating tale by Patrick Taylor, a true Irish storyteller.</p></p><p><b>Patrick Taylor, M.D.</b>, is the author of the Irish Country books, including <i>An Irish Country Doctor</i>, <i>An Irish Country Village</i>, <i>An Irish Country Christmas</i>, <i>An Irish Country Girl</i>, and <i>An Irish Country Courtship</i>. Taylor was born and raised in Bangor, County Down, in Northern Ireland. After qualifying as a specialist in 1969, he worked in Canada for thirty-one years. He now lives on Saltspring Island, British Columbia.<p>1&#x201c;Run along, make your calls, and enjoy His Lordship&#x2019;s hooley,&#x201c; said Mrs. Maureen Kincaid, &#x201c;Kinky&#x201d; to her friends, as she knelt in the hall and sponged Ribena black-currant cordial from a small boy&#x2019;s tweed overcoat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll expect you all back by five, sir, not a minute later. I&#x2019;d not want the Christmas dinner to be spoiled.&#x201d;</p><p>Her employer, Doctor Fingal Flahertie O&#x2019;Reilly, said over his shoulder, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be on time, I promise, Kinky.&#x201d; He strode off accompanied by his guest, Caitlin &#x201c;Kitty&#x201d; O&#x2019;Hallorhan, and his young assistant, Doctor Barry Laverty.</p><p>Kinky shut the front door after them. She imagined that over the excited voices of the children she could hear footsteps crunching through the freshly fallen snow as Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly led his little party to his big old Rover for the drive to Ballybucklebo House and the marquis&#x2019; 1964 Christmas Day open house.</p><p>It was warmer in the hall with the door shut. Just as well with a dozen chilled little carollers inside drinking hot black-currant juice. She straightened up, inspected her handiwork, and smiled. &#x201c;There you are, Dermot Fogarty. Good as new, so.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank youse, Mrs. Kincaid.&#x201d; The eight-year-old bobbed his head. &#x201c;If I&#x2019;d got my new coat dirty, my daddy would&#x2019;ve killed me, so he would.&#x201d;</p><p>She tousled his hair. Not for the first time she thought how harsh to her ears the County Down accent sounded, especially when she remembered the softer brogue of her own people down in County Cork.</p><p>She&#x2019;d grown up there on a farm near Beal na mBl�th and had left as a slip of a girl of nineteen to come north in 1928. That had been thirty-six years ago. She shook her head. It seemed like no time at all.</p><p>&#x201c;Here.&#x201d; She refilled Dermot&#x2019;s mug, feeling the heat in the delft and inhaling the scent of the black-currant juice. &#x201c;Try not to spill any more.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Mrs. Kincaid.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Anyone else?&#x201d;</p><p>Several voices replied, &#x201c;No thank you, Mrs. Kincaid.&#x201d;</p><p>The kiddies were crammed into the hall and overflowing up the broad staircase of Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s house at Number 1 Main Street, Ballybucklebo, County Down.</p><p>&#x201c;Then eat up, and drink up, and let&#x2019;s be having a bit of hush.&#x201d; They were quiet now, filling their faces with Kinky&#x2019;s homemade sweet mince pies and hot juice. She beamed over them. She liked children, would have loved to have had some of her own, but that hadn&#x2019;t been meant to be. She smiled sadly to herself.</p><p>She probably could have found another fellah here in Ulster, but och, he&#x2019;d not have been the Paudeen Kincaid she lost so long ago. She saw herself in the hall mirror and thought she&#x2019;d not been a bad-looking lass when she&#x2019;d been with Paudeen. Her silver hair, which she wore in a chignon now, was chestnut then and had flowed in soft waves to her shoulders. It was the worry about him one Saint Stephen&#x2019;s Day that had started the turning of it.</p><p>She&#x2019;d been a slim girl then. Now, she knew she could afford to lose a couple of stone, although doing so wouldn&#x2019;t get rid of her three chins. But it was hard not to sample her own cooking, and she did love to cook. She always had, ever since Ma had showed her how all those years ago.</p><p>She shook her head, and sure if the years had passed, hadn&#x2019;t they been good ones ever since she&#x2019;d come here, first as house keeper to old Doctor Flanagan and later on, in 1946, to Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly when he took over the practice? And hadn&#x2019;t looking after those two bachelor men been a satisfying job, and almost the same as rearing chisellers?</p><p>Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly, learned man that he was, would not get out of the house without egg stains on his tie if she wasn&#x2019;t there to sponge them off or make him change it. He often called his Labrador, Arthur Guinness, a great lummox. Sometimes, she thought with affection, the pot does call the kettle black.</p><p>&#x201c;Pleath, Mithis Kincaid?&#x201d; A child&#x2019;s voice interrupted her thoughts.</p><p>She saw Billy Cadogan, a boy who suffered from asthma. He&#x2019;d been a patient of the practice since Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly and Miss Hagerty, the midwife, had delivered him ten years ago. &#x201c;Yes, Billy?&#x201d; He looked smart in what must be his brand-new cap and bright red mittens.</p><p>He held up his mug. &#x201c;Pleath, Mithis Kincaid, can I have a toty wee taste more? Ith cold thinging carolth round the houtheth today, tho it ith.&#x201d;</p><p>So, she thought, she should have known that Billy was the one lisping when they sang &#x201c;We Wish You a Merry Christmas.&#x201d;</p><p>Before she could answer, Colin Brown chipped in, &#x201c;Billy&#x2019;s right; it would found er you.&#x201d; Even today he was wearing short pants. His bare knees stuck out from under his overcoat, and his left sock was crumpled around his ankle. Colin was the lad who had single-handedly, as the innkeeper at the recent Nativity play, caused the mother superior to faint. Colin spoke again. &#x201c;My Da says it&#x2019;s as cold as a witch&#x2019;s tit today, so he does.&#x201d;</p><p>Kinky frowned, then seeing the seriousness on the boy&#x2019;s face, realized that he was merely repeating what he had heard his notoriously foul-mouthed father say. &#x201c;And what would you know of witches, Colin Brown?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Oooh,&#x201c; said Colin, &#x201c;witches is oul&#x2019; wizenedy women with wrinkles and warts on their green faces. They have black cats, they wear pointy hats and black dresses, ride around on broomsticks on Halloween night... they cast spells, and...&#x201d;&#x2014;he frowned&#x2014;&#x201d;and...&#x201d; Then a smile split his face and his words came out in a rush. &#x201c;And they get together in ovens.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Colin means &#x2018;covens.&#x2019; &#x201c; That was Hazel Arbuthnot. She was Aggie Arbuthnot&#x2019;s twelve-year-old daughter. She had lustrous black hair, just like her mother. For a moment, Kinky wondered if Hazel had also inherited the family trait of six toes. No doubt Cissie Sloan, Aggie&#x2019;s cousin and the most talkative woman in the village, would know.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, Hazel, covens.&#x201d; Kinky heard the other children laughing at Colin&#x2019;s discomfiture. &#x201c;And there&#x2019;s no need to laugh at Colin. He nearly got it right.&#x201d;</p><p>The giggling subsided.</p><p>&#x201c;And some witches do cast evil spells and sour the milk, or make the crops fail or animals die&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oooh.&#x201d; Several voices were raised, and Kinky heard sharp in-drawings of breath.</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2014;but some are good witches.&#x201d; She paused to let that sink in.</p><p>&#x201c;Good witches?&#x201d; Eddie Jingles asked. He&#x2019;d had pneumonia two weeks before Christmas. He was better now, but his mother, Jeannie, had very sensibly wrapped him up in boots, thick trousers, a heavy anorak, a green scarf, and a blue-and-white-striped wool toque. &#x201c;I never knew there was good witches. Are you having us on, Mrs. Kincaid?&#x201d;</p><p>Kinky scowled at him, then let a smile play at the corners of her mouth. &#x201c;Why would you think I was making it up, Eddie Jingles?&#x201d;</p><p>Eddie blushed and lowered his head. &#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now,&#x201c; she said, &#x201c;how many of you believe there are good witches? Hold up your hands.&#x201d;</p><p>Jeannie Kennedy&#x2019;s hand was the first to go up, then Micky Corry&#x2019;s. Those two had been Mary and Joseph in the Christmas pageant earlier that week. The last hand raised was Colin Brown&#x2019;s, but Kinky had expected that. Colin had a mind of his own.</p><p>&#x201c;Good. So we&#x2019;re all in agreement then?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Mrs. Kincaid,&#x201c; a chorus of voices replied.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad to hear it.&#x201d; She lowered her voice and let her gaze wander over the group, looking this one, then that one, right in the eye. &#x201c;Because my own mother was a good witch, so. My very own mother, and she got it from her mother, my granny.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Does that make you a witch too, Mrs. Kincaid... since your mammy was one?&#x201d; Colin had his head cocked to one side, his eyes narrowed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve no warts on your nose, like.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be impudent, Colin Brown.&#x201d; She put her face closer to his, flared her nostrils, and widened her eyes. &#x201c;Or I&#x2019;ll turn you into a tooooadstool.&#x201d;</p><p>The communal &#x201c;oooh&#x201d; was much louder.</p><p>Seeing the look on Colin&#x2019;s face, Kinky softened. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m only pulling your leg, son, so, for I&#x2019;m not a witch at all. I couldn&#x2019;t turn you into anything.&#x201d; Even if I did get the sight to see the future from my mother, Kinky thought, but that&#x2019;s none of their business. &#x201c;And if I was... if... I&#x2019;d be a good witch and lift spells or smell out bad witches or cure people with herbs or find water wells&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;With a hazel twig?&#x201d; Billy Cadogan interrupted.</p><p>&#x201c;Or a Hazel Arbuthnot,&#x201c; Colin said, then sniggered and stuck his tongue out at Hazel.</p><p>&#x201c;Less of that, Colin, or I&#x2019;ll not tell you any more,&#x201c; Kinky said.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201c; Colin said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll houl&#x2019; my wheest. Honest.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You do that, so,&#x201c; said Kinky. She let a silence hang, and hang, until Hazel said, &#x201c;Pay him no heed, Mrs. Kincaid. He was just acting the lig. I don&#x2019;t mind. Go on, please tell us more.&#x201d;</p><p>Several other children added, &#x201c;Please... please.&#x201d;</p><p>Kinky smiled. The sight wasn&#x2019;t the only thing she&#x2019;d got from her family, and that was a story in itself. Her Da, God rest him, had been a famous seanachie, a storyteller, and Kinky Kincaid, when given an audience, liked nothing better than to spin a good yarn.</p><p>&#x201c;So, it&#x2019;s a story you want?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please.&#x201d; She saw the expec...</p></p><h2>Mineral Nutrition and Plant Disease</h2><p>This comprehensive book examines how mineral nutrition affects plant disease. Minerals improve the overall quality and health of plants. Knowing how each individual mineral affects a plant is beneficial for efficiency in production and sustaining the ecosystem. From a plant pathology perspective, Mineral Nutrition and Plant Disease brings the discussion of plant disease diagnosis and management to a new level. Mineral nutrients are important in production agriculture and horticulture because they can often be the first line of defense against plant diseases. It is an area of knowledge that can be misunderstood or overlooked in the study of diseases and their diagnosis. This reference succeeds in organizing what we know and explaining the interactions at work. Mineral Nutrition and Plant Disease is the first book to successfully combine two important plant science disciplines, nutrition and pathology, to provide current information on theoretical aspects of nutrition in disease physiology while contributing a wealth of basic practical information for obtaining immediate disease suppression with specific fertilizers.<br>Special Features: <br><br>Provides a holistic overview of how minerals are made available in soil and their basic function in plants <br>Helps you understand the interacting affects of minerals on all types of diseases Abiotic as well as biotic <br>Identifies mineral nutrient forms, physiological functions, and interactions with numerous diseases <br>Provides valuable tables showing nutrient-disease interactions that facilitate the use of nutrients to manage diseases <br>Tabulates extensive literature reviews with tables to help you perform quick searches for any host/disease system<br><br>The book is peer-reviewed and multi-authored by scientists with expertise relating to each specific mineral element. A user-friendly benefit of this book is that each chapter focuses on one specific mineral element and explains the relationship between the nutrient and its affect on plant diseases. Each chapter describes the critical levels of each element involved in plant disease interactions, the effects of these elements on pathogens and plants, and the known mechanisms of how these elements suppress plant diseases. Benefits of specific mineral nutrients in each chapter recognize their interdependent interaction with each other and all aspects of the plant physiology, genetics, and the environment. These mineral nutrient chapters are preceded by two helpful chapters on the Chemistry of Plant Nutrients in Soil and The Physiological Role of Minerals in the Plant. <br><br>The purpose of this important treatise is to outline the current knowledge of mineral nutrition and plant diseases. Readers will gain practical information for immediate disease management and understand the physiological role of each element in the plant and how it contributes to disease. Editors Datnoff, Elmer, and Huber, have done a commendable job in collaboration with their expert contributors.

Millions of Christians through the ages and across the world have treasured it as their most valued possession, often insisting that anyone can pick up the Bible and read and understand it for themselves. But many of the details remain fuzzy until we find out more about their historical or literary setting. <em>The IVP Introduction to the Bible</em> is intended to reduce the fuzziness, in two ways: First, by providing background information to the whole Bible and each testament, as well as the gap between the testaments. Second, by introducing all the main sections of the Bible and each biblical book in turn. So the great biblical panorama is brought to life, first with broad brush strokes and then with fine art work. This Bible introduction is written by an international and interdenominational team of evangelical scholars, among them <ul><li>Desmond Alexander, author of <em>From Paradise to the Promised Land</em></li><li>Tremper Longman III, author of <em>How to Read the Psalms</em> and <em>How to Read Proverbs</em></li><li>Howard Marshall, author of <em>New Testament Theology</em></li><li>Mark Strauss, author of <em>Four Portraits, One Jesus</em></li></ul> All are involved in teaching biblical studies at a theological college, seminary or university, and each writing in their area of specialization. As they guide you expertly through the details, your understanding of the Bible and its message will be greatly enhanced. Readers of all stripes, from curious non-Christians to serious students of the Bible, will find <em>The IVP Introduction to the Bible</em> a helpful and enjoyable resource.</p><p><strong>Philip S. Johnston</strong> is senior tutor at Hughes Hall, Cambridge. He has also taught at Belfast, St. Andrews and Oxford. His books include <em>Interpreting the Psalms</em> (coeditor with David Firth), <em>Shades of Sheol</em> and <em>The Land of Promise</em> (coeditor with Peter Walker).<em>The IVP Introduction to the Bible</em> will prove especially valuable to novice to intermediate biblical students and scholars. Highly recommended as a solid religious studies reference for public and college library shelves. (Wisconsin Bookwatch, September 2007)<br><br>This concise, compact distillation of the intended teachings of ancient writers of books of the Bible is very well done. Various knowledgeable contributors make this a valuable tool for anyone interested in understanding the Bible. (Libraries Alive, Fall 2007)<br><br>Gathers an impressive group of scholars writing brief introductions and overviews for each section of the Bible as well as an overall introduction to the Bible and a section on the history between the two testaments. There is much helpful material here nicely summarized. (Preaching.com, Bible and Bible Reference Survey 2007)<br><br>"Both the Bible itself and the field of biblical studies are large and complex. But they are also immensely rich and rewarding. Here is a clear introduction by evangelical scholars who know what they're talking about. It is substantial enough to deliver what it promises without being ponderous and technical. A good introduction for the interested nonspecialist. I warmly recommend it." (Dr. Barry Webb, Research Fellow in Old Testament, Moore College, Sydney, Australia)<br><br>"Anyone who makes a serious effort at reading the Bible soon finds that it is not easy. This book is designed to help by providing both specific information and general perspective for today's readers. It does not assume much prior knowledge, but nor does it 'talk down.' Be prepared for some demanding reading, as acknowledged experts distill their specialist knowledge into an accessible text. And be prepared too to be led, gently but firmly, out of your 'comfort zone': the Bible is not a comfortable book, and this volume does not disguise the fact. But if you are ready to be stretched, welcome to an exciting voyage of discovery that will last a lifetime." (Dr. Dick France, former Principal, Wycliffe Hall, Oxford)<br><br>"This splendid book provides a clear, structured and accessible overview of the whole Bible. Its genius is in blending qualities that might easily cancel each other out. For instance, it provides the essential tools and information to make Bible study illuminating and productive, but does so without readers realizing they are being taught a wide range of literary, historical and theological issues. Some recent Bible overviews have provided a major motif running like a motorway from Genesis to Revelation, but haven't shown the reader how to navigate the minor roads with profit. This work, by contrast, gives enough detail to explore, and sufficient direction not to get lost. Finally and perhaps most importantly, it blends an academic rigor with a godly humility--essential to hearing God's Word. Brian Rosner conveys this well in his essay on interpretation: 'The biggest obstacle to right reading is not a dull mind, nor the absence of specialized knowledge, but a hard heart. As God's word to the world the message of the NT is accessible to all who come to it in faith.' I warmly commend this timely book." (Richard Cunningham, Director, Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship)<br><br>"If I had only one book to help me understand the Bible, this is the one I would go for. Skillfully edited by Dr. Philip Johnston, a group of orthodox scholars not only give a comprehensive survey of all the books in the Bible, but also provide four chapters introducing both the Old and New Testaments (Story, Background, Theology, Interpretation) along with an important chapter 'Between the Testaments.' The style is clear and accessible, requires no specialist knowledge, and combines sound scholarship with an evident love for the Bible. Students and church members alike will find it invaluable. I commend it wholeheartedly."

The authors unpack queer criminal archetypes&#x2014;like &#x201c;gleeful gay killers,&#x201d; &#x201c;lethal lesbians,&#x201d; &#x201c;disease spreaders,&#x201d; and &#x201c;deceptive gender benders&#x201d;&#x2014;to illustrate the punishment of queer expression, regardless of whether a crime was ever committed. Tracing stories from the streets to the bench to behind prison bars, they prove that the policing of sex and gender both bolsters and reinforces racial and gender inequalities.</p><p><b>Joey L.

The late 1960s saw frequent police raids, often accompanied by brutality, on gay establishments across the country, which were meeting with increasing resistance. The previous five years had also seen uprisings in Watts, Detroit, Chicago, and Newark and dozens of other cities, in many cases sparked by incidents of widespread racial profiling and abuse of people of color by police.</p><p>It was against this backdrop that, in the early morning hours of Saturday, June 28, 1969, police raided the Stonewall Inn in New York City. Claiming to be enforcing liquor laws, they began arresting employees and patrons of the private lesbian and gay establishment. Police action, which included striking patrons with billy clubs while spewing homophobic abuse, sparked outrage among those present. Led by people described by many as drag queens and butch lesbians, bar patrons, joined by street people, began yelling &#x201c;Gay Power!&#x201d; and throwing shoes, coins, and bricks at the officers. Over the next several nights, police and queers clashed repeatedly in the streets of the West Village. One report described the impacts of the police response to the uprising as follows:</p><p>At one point, Seventh Avenue . . . looked like a battlefield in Vietnam. Young people, many of them queens, were lying on the sidewalk bleeding from the head, face, mouth, and even the eyes. Others were nursing bruised and often bleeding arms, legs, backs, and necks.</p><p>The Stonewall Uprising, as the rebellion against the raids came to be known, has been mythically cast as the &#x201c;birthplace&#x201d; of the modern LGBT rights movement in the United States, although in reality it was but one of its primary catalysts. In the weeks that followed, the Gay Liberation Front, inspired by contemporaneous movements such as the women&#x2019;s liberation movement, the Black Panthers, and the Young Lords, was formed. Spontaneous resistance to police raids on gay bars and bathhouses blossomed in the ensuing decade. The 1970 protest march commemorating the one-year anniversary of the raid on the Stonewall Inn grew into an annual worldwide celebration of gay pride.</p><p>Fast forward three decades to March 2003, when the Power Plant, a private club in the Highland Park area of Detroit, frequented primarily by African American gay men, lesbians, and transgender women, was filled to capacity. Around 3:00 a.m., between 50 and 100 officers from the Wayne County Sheriff&#x2019;s Department dressed in black clothing, with guns drawn and laser sights on, suddenly cut the lights and stormed the premises, shouting orders for everyone to &#x201c;hit the floor.&#x201d; Over 350 people in the club at that time were handcuffed, forced to lie face down on the floor, and detained for up to twelve hours, left to &#x201c;sit in their own and others&#x2019; urine and waste.&#x201d; Some were kicked in the head and back, slammed into walls, and verbally abused. Officers on the scene were heard saying things like &#x201c;it&#x2019;s a bunch of fags&#x201d; and &#x201c;those fags in here make me sick.&#x201d; As at Stonewall, the officers claimed to be enforcing building and liquor codes. The sheriff&#x2019;s department said they were responding to complaints from neighbors and concerns for public safety. They had obtained a warrant to search the premises, but rather than execute it during the daytime against only the owner of the establishment, they chose to wait until the club was full, and then unjustifiably arrested over 300 people, citing them for &#x201c;loitering inside a building,&#x201d; an offense carrying a maximum fine of $500. Vehicles within a three-block radius of the club were also ticketed and towed, despite the fact that some of the car owners had never even entered the club that night.</p><p>The policing of queer sexualities has been arguably the most visible and recognized point of contact between LGBT people and the criminal legal system. From the images that form the opening sequence of <i>Milk</i>&#x2014;the 2008 biopic about gay San Francisco supervisor Harvey Milk&#x2014;of groups of white gay men hiding from cameras as they are rounded up by police in the 1950s, to the historic clashes with police of the late 1960s and early 1970s, police repression and resistance to it are central themes of gay life in the United States. Groundbreaking gay rights organizations such as the Mattachine Society and the Daughters of Bilitis have expressed strong concern about bar raids and police harassment. A study conducted by the National Gay Task Force (now the NGLTF) in the mid-eighties found that 23 percent of gay men and 13 percent of lesbians reported having been harassed, threatened with violence, or physically attacked by police because of their sexual orientation. It remains a daily occurrence for large numbers of LGBT people. According to reports made to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP) in 2008, law enforcement officers were the third-largest category of perpetrators of anti-LGBT violence. Incidences of reported police violence against LGBT people increased by 150 percent between 2007 and 2008, and the number of law enforcement officers reported to have engaged in abusive treatment of LGBT people increased by 11 percent. In 2000, the NCAVP stated that 50 percent of bias-related violence reported by transgender women in San Francisco was committed by police and private security officers.</p><p>As demonstrated by the Power Plant incident, in many ways, policing of queers has not changed significantly since the days when it sparked outrage and resistance from LGBT communities, although its focus has narrowed to some degree. According to the New York City Anti-Violence Project, &#x201c;Young queer people of color, transgender youth, homeless and street involved youth are more vulnerable to police violence . . . AVP&#x2019;s data analysis also reveals that transgender individuals are at a greater risk of experiencing police violence Far from fading into the annals of LGBT history, police violence against queers is alive and well.</p><p>Yet with the exception of sodomy law enforcement, since the mid- 1970s resistance to abusive policing of LGBT people has largely been absent from the agendas of national mainstream LGBT organizations, particularly as police have increasingly narrowed their focus to segments of LGBT communities with little power or voice inside and outside such groups. Similarly, while mainstream police accountability and civil rights organizations have called for accountability in a limited number of cases involving LGBT individuals, policing of gender and queer sexualities has not been central to their analysis of the issue. It is essential to bring the persistent police violence experienced by LGBT people to the fore of these movements to ensure the ghosts of Stonewall do not continue to haunt for years to come.</p><p><b>Policing Social Order</b></p><p>In order to better understand the roots and forms of policing of LGBT communities, it is important to consider the power police possess and the role they play in society. Police and other law enforcement agents do not merely objectively enforce the letter of the law. Practically speaking, they also function as lawmakers in their own right. They are given considerable latitude in deciding which laws to enforce, how to enforce them, and which people to target for enforcement. And they often consciously and unconsciously exercise that broad discretion in ways that are anything but neutral. Far from being passive players just doing a job, law enforcement agents play a crucial role in manufacturing, acting on, and enforcing criminalizing archetypes.</p><p>The advent of &#x201c;quality of life&#x201d; policing in the 1990s further facilitated this process. This now predominant law enforcement paradigm is premised on maintaining social order through aggressive enforcement of quality of life regulations, rooted in age-old vagrancy laws, which prohibit an expanding spectrum of activities in public spaces, including standing (loitering), sitting, sleeping, eating, drinking, urinating, making noise, and approaching strangers. It is based on the theory that minor indications of &#x201c;disorder&#x201d;&#x2014;a broken window, youth hanging out on the corner, public drinking&#x2014;ultimately lead to more serious criminal activity. While such regulations may appear innocent at first blush, in reality, by criminalizing ordinary and otherwise lawful activities, this new paradigm has given police additional tools to stop, ticket, and arrest increasing numbers of people, most notably youth and homeless people. In 2006 alone, the NYPD stopped, questioned and/or frisked over half a million people, a 500 percent increase over the previous year. Over 80 percent were Black or Latina/o, even though these groups make up only 53.6 percent of the NYC population, while only approximately 10 percent were white, compared to 44 percent of the population. Quality of life stops also create additional opportunities for police officers to use force. While &#x201c;quality of life&#x201d; offenses are often low-level misdemeanors or violations (the equivalent of a speeding ticket), an accumulation of tickets or failure to appear in court often leads to more serious consequences.</p><p>Given their extensive reach and the common occurrence of the types of conduct they prohibit, it is virtually impossible to enforce all quality of life regulations against all people at all times and in all places. As Yale law professor Charles Reich notes, &#x201c;Laws that are widely violated . . . especially lend themselves to selective and arbitrary enforcement.&#x201d; Additionally, the language of quality of life regulations, such as those prohibiting &#x201c;disorderly&#x201d; or lewd conduct or loitering, is often vague and subject to multiple interpretations when determining what kinds of conduct to punish, and by whom. Ultimately, &#x201c;zero tolerance&#x201d; for quality of life violations means zero tolerance for undesirables, and quality of life can mean quality of life for property and business owners at the expense of quality of life for countless others.</p><p>Social constructions of deviance and criminality pervade the myriad routine practices and procedures through which law enforcement agents decide whom to stop on the streets or highways, whom to question, search, and arrest, and whom to subject to brutal force. The statistics reflecting persistent and pervasive racial profiling are as familiar as they are dizzying. Behind the numbers are the stories of daily harassment and arbitrary police action premised on presumptions of criminality that attach to some, but not others.</p><p>A Black gay man peacefully walking in a park in New York City was confronted by an officer pointing a gun at him, saying, &#x201c;If you an arcade with friends in a gay neighborhood in Chicago when an officer passing by in a police car yelled at the young people to &#x201c;move their ass.&#x201d; The officer then pulled over to stop and search them, calling the young man a &#x201c;nigger faggot&#x201d; while telling him his &#x201c;ass is not big enough to fuck.&#x201d; The young man was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct. The charges were later dismissed. Driving such seemingly routine incidents are undercurrents of archetypal narratives framing Black men as inherently up to no good, and gay men as individuals whose sexuality must be informally controlled, even where they have broken no law.</p><p>In addition to possessing the power to stop and arrest, police also have the ability to utilize force as a tool of order maintenance. Criminalizing archetypes framing particular individuals and groups as inherently dangerous, violent, mentally unstable, or disposable fuel and justify physical abuse by police. Statistics pointing to the disproportionate use of force against people of color&#x2014;including LGBT people of color&#x2014;abound, and there is no shortage of illustrations bringing the numbers to life.</p><p>A gay Latino man stopped for a traffic offense in Oakland, California, in 2001 was arrested and placed in a patrol car&#x2014;but not until an officer who noticed his pink socks called them &#x201c;faggot socks&#x201d; and slammed his ankle in the car door so hard the man required medical treatment. Freddie Mason, a thirty-one-year-old Black gay nurse&#x2019;s assistant with no prior criminal record, was arrested following a verbal altercation with his landlord and anally raped with a billy club covered in cleaning liquid by a Chicago police officer who called him a &#x201c;nigger fag&#x201d; and told him &#x201c;I&#x2019;m tired of you faggot . . . you sick mother fucker.&#x201d; Two lesbians of color arrested outside a club hosting a women&#x2019;s night in Brooklyn, New York, in 2009 were beaten by officers who called one a &#x201c;bitch ass dyke.&#x201d; In each of these cases, under the guise of responding to alleged minor, nonviolent offenses, officers used brute force to maintain raced, gendered, and heterosexual &#x201c;order.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>New Passages: Mapping Your Life Across Time</h2><p>THE #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER <br>Millions of readers literally defined their lives through Gail Sheehy's landmark bestseller Passages. Seven years ago she set out to write a sequel, but instead she discovered a historic revolution in the adult life cycle. . . <br>People are taking longer to grow up and much longer to die. A fifty-year-old woman--who remains free of cancer and heart disease-- can expect to see her ninety-second birthday. Men, too, can expect a dramatically lengthened life span. The old demarcations and descriptions of adulthood--beginning at twenty-one and ending at sixty-five--are hopelessly out of date. In New Passages, Gail Sheehy discovers and maps out a completely new frontier--a Second Adulthood in middle life.<br>"Stop and recalculate," Sheehy writes. "Imagine the day you turn forty-five as the infancy of another life." Instead of declining, men and women who embrace a Second Adulthood are progressing through entirely new passages into lives of deeper meaning, renewed playfulness, and creativity--beyond both male and female menopause. Through hundreds of personal and group interviews, national surveys of professionals and working-class people, and fresh findings extracted from fifty years of U.S. Census reports, Sheehy vividly dramatizes these newly developing stages. Combining the scholar's ability to synthesize data with the novelist's gift for storytelling, she allows us to make sense of our own lives by understanding others like us.<br>New Passages tells us we have the ability to customize our own life cycle. This groundbreaking work is certain to awaken and permanently alter the way we think about ourselves.<br>"SHEEHY CLEARLY STATES IDEAS ABOUT LIFE THAT HAVE NEVER BEFORE BEEN AS CLEARLY STATED."<br>--Los Angeles Times Book Review<br>"AN OPTIMISTIC ANALYSIS OF ADULT DEVELOPMENT IN PESSIMISTIC TIMES. . .

The point where you and your friends came in on your cultures history has influenced your choices and attitudes. That distinctive generational coloration affects each stage of life and the passages between them, profoundly influencing which tasks of development you accomplish early, which you postpone, and which you will have to catch up on&#x2014;or may never complete.<br> &nbsp;<br> WHICH GENERATION ARE YOU TRAVELING WITH?<br> &nbsp;<br> I invite you to join me in mapping your own life across time. Five different generations now occupy contemporary adulthood, spanning birth dates from 1914 to 1980. You will probably find your peer traveling companions among the capsule descriptions of those five generations in this chapter.<br> &nbsp;<br> To represent each one, I have selected five birth years that make up a definable &#x201c;cohort group,&#x201d; a sociological term that refers to people who will always share a common location in history. (See Key to Your Cohort chart.) Not only were members of any cohort born within the same few years, but they have experienced defining events when they were the same age. Economic and social conditions along with technological and medical advances have either sped up or held back their development. Thus people in different cohorts age in different ways.<br> &nbsp;<br> Drawing on the PUMS file&#x2014;the unique database created from Census Bureau data that spans fifty years of information on the entire U.S. population&#x2014;we are able to compare and contrast what is happening at any stage to a particular cohort group over its lifetime, with regard to educational and occupational achievement, labor force status, income level, marriage, childbearing, and divorce patterns.<br> &nbsp;<br> You can look yourself up in this book and compare yourself to people in your parents&#x2019; or your children&#x2019;s age-groups. For instance, if you are a woman in your mid-forties, you will find yourself under the Vietnam Generation at every stage you have so far encountered&#x2014;from Pulling Up Roots to the Tryout Twenties, Turbulent Thirties, and Flourishing Forties. Check out the striking increases in your education, professionalism, income, and childlessness compared with women of the previous &#x201c;Silent&#x201d; Generation. If you are a man in his sixties from the World War II Generation, you can look yourself up through the Flaming Fifties and Harmonizing Sixties. Notice, for example, how faithfully married you have remained since your thirties and how unprepared you are to retire at the traditional age of 65.<br> &nbsp;<br> To highlight the ground conditions when you and your cohort set off on the journey of adult life, each of the five generations described below in capsules are compared during the transition out of adolescence. Pulling Up Roots, as I called it in Passages, is the time when we begin detaching from the family and initiating the search for a personal identity. Anything seems possible, but everything is open to question.<br> &nbsp;<br> The tasks of this Pulling Up Roots passage are to locate ourselves in a peer group role, a sex role, an anticipated occupation, and an ideology or worldview&#x2014;a tall order. By engaging in these tasks, we gather the impetus to leave home physically and the identity to begin leaving home emotionally. We generally start at this stage by claiming control over at least one aspect of our lives that our parents can&#x2019;t touch. This is a key building block of adulthood. Reduced to its essence, mental health is enhanced by expanding our control over our environment.<br> &nbsp;<br> This passage used to begin in earnest about age 18 and was usually completed by age 22. Military service, early marriage, or college created a compulsory break away from home. Exposure to a multicultural milieu was much more common when boys had to go to either college or boot camp, where rich and poor, snobs and hicks, North and South, all had to bunk in together. Universal military service ended in the United States in 1973. Volunteer military service now attracts only 6.4 percent of 18- to 19-year-old men.<br> &nbsp;<br> Previous generations of men were desperate to have a paycheck by the age of 21. Supporting themselves was how they demonstrated they had achieved manhood. Young women were expected to be content with an identity confined by traditional sex roles. The message was: You are whom you marry and whom you mother. Thus women were often willing at 19 to make &#x201c;jailbreak marriages&#x201d; with inappropriate men just to get away from parental control.<br> &nbsp;<br> Today, with the economies of the United States and Europe in the midst of a random revolution, men and women of any age feel the control over their lives threatened. To those in the not-yet-ready-for-adulthood age-group, it is particularly disorienting to have the economic ground beneath them shifting even as they make their first test steps. They haven&#x2019;t had a chance yet to develop mature defenses or master any major life crises.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Youth in crisis.&#x201d; The label is axiomatic for any generation. Do you recognize the generation described in the following commentary from a TV magazine show?<br> &nbsp;<br> They feel the rising sense of anxiety and insecurity... senseless outbreaks of savagery, as race rioting, and they are quick to absorb the new spirit of violence and recklessness.<br> &nbsp;<br> The accompanying video depicts kids in their early teens smoking dope, buying pornography, and streetwalking to catch tricks. As usual, the finger of guilt for allowing this general decline in the moral health of youth is pointed at the working mother:<br> &nbsp;<br> Today U.S. industry is employing hundreds of thousands of women, who before ... were homemakers, devoting their full time to their families ... the latchkey kid, whose working parents leave her to shift for herself at home, is today a familiar... phenomenon. Everywhere, children of working parents are being left without adequate supervision or restraint.<br> &nbsp;<br> But this was not Dan Quayle harping on parents of the &#x201c;X Generation&#x201d; for failing to instill family values. This was a 1940s Time magazine documentary film about &#x201c;Youth in Crisis,&#x201d; depicting George Bush&#x2019;s World War II Generation. At 19 or 22, its older male members were already away at war, proving themselves as young men in the most traditional way, while their younger brothers and sisters back home were discovering an alternative mode&#x2014;juvenile delinquency. Herbert Hoover was beside himself about it. Mothers had been &#x201c;drafted&#x201d; by society to run the engines of war factories left idle by their soldiering husbands. Society had not foreseen the necessity to provide adequate day care.<br> &nbsp;<br> So what&#x2019;s new? During the 1970s and 1980s, while total money income levels were declining in constant dollars for men in every age-group except those over 65,3 wives and mothers were again &#x201c;drafted&#x201d; to jump-start the economy. The extra engine driving the economy during the 1980s, so that total income didn&#x2019;t go down more than it did, was working women and wives. The Census Bureau incomes expert Paul Ryscavage corroborated my findings: &#x201c;Returns on education for women during the 1980s drove earnings for all households in the country.&#x201d; Once again society hasn&#x2019;t caught up with the realities and provided adequate child care for the younger women who need it in order to work longer hours.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Let&#x2019;s look at psychological health in this age-group fifty years ago. One out of every four of the scared young men of the World War II Generation who stripped down for his draft physical was rejected by Selective Service because of a &#x201c;mental or nervous condition.&#x201d;5 Of course, the fact that nothing like that number remained psychologically dysfunctional in adulthood suggests that much of the turmoil of this passage is not new. Adolescents have always been susceptible to a &#x201c;flu of the personality,&#x201d; with brief but severe depressive episodes a fairly common accompaniment to the growing pains of adolescing. Weren&#x2019;t you certain you would never recover from your first broken heart?<br> &nbsp;<br> And so, while this chapter focuses on disparities in the life cycle from one generation to the next, be aware that important aspects of our inner development remain true to stage.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Little Pea (Little Books)</h2><p>Ten years ago, Amy Krouse Rosenthal burst into children's books with <em>Little Pea</em>, a book destined to become a classic.

It is the mathematical method for the analysis of things that change, and since in the natural world we are surrounded by change, the development of calculus was a huge breakthrough in the history of mathematics. But it is also something of a mathematical adventure, largely because of the way infinity enters at virtually every twist and turn...<br><br>In <em>The Calculus Story</em>, David Acheson presents a wide-ranging picture of calculus and its applications, from ancient Greece right up to the present day. Drawing on their original writings, he introduces the people who helped to build our understanding of calculus. With a step-by-step treatment, he demonstrates how to start doing calculus, from the very beginning.<br></p><p><br>David Acheson, <em>Emeritus Fellow, Jesus College, University of Oxford</em><br><br>David Acheson is a British applied mathematician, best known for his popular maths book <em>1089 and All That</em> (OUP, 2010), which has been translated into 11 languages. He is an Emeritus Fellow of Jesus College, Oxford, and was Oxford University's first winner of a National Teaching Fellowship, in 2004. He was President of the Mathematical Association for 2010-11, and now lectures widely on mathematics to young people and the general public. In 2013, David Acheson was awarded an Honorary D.Sc by the University of East Anglia for his outstanding work in the popularisation of mathematics.<br><br>"A masterpiece." -- Steven Strogatz, professor of mathematics, Cornell University, and author of <em> The Joy of X</em>, and <em>Infinite Powers</em><p></p><br>"This is the book on calculus I wish I'd written.

David Acheson belongs in the league of great authors of popular works on mathematics." -- George Matthews, Mathematics Today<p></p><br>"This is a splendid little book by the author of the best seller <em>1089 and all that</em>. It is written in the same brisk and engaging style, making it accessible to a very wide audience... [David Acheson] set himself a stiff challenge and has passed with flying colours. The book is highly recommended and should prove to be another best seller." -- Adam McBride, <em>The Mathematical Gazette</em><p></p><br>"Don't panic if your mathematical muscles appear to have withered away (or you never truly cracked differentiation), David Acheson's <em>The Calculus Story</em> could be just the thing. ...

Its people, for three thousand years under the thumb of one invader after another, hold tightly onto a culture so unique that they remain emotionally and culturally distinct, viewing themselves first as Sicilians, not Italians. Many of these islanders, carrying considerable DNA from Arab and Muslim ancestors who ruled for 250 years and integrated vast numbers of settlers from the continent just ninety miles to the south, say proudly that Sicily is located north of Africa, <i>not</i> south of Italy.</p><p><i>Seeking Sicily </i>explores what lies behind the soul of the island's inhabitants. It touches on history, archaeology, food, the Mafia, and politics and looks to nineteenth- and twentieth-century Sicilian authors to plumb the islanders' so-called <i>Sicilitudine</i>. This "culture apart" is best exemplified by the writings of one of Sicily's greatest writers, Leonardo Sciascia. <i>Seeking Sicily</i> also looks to contemporary Sicilians who have never shaken off the influences of their forbearers, who believed in the ancient gods and goddesses.</p><p>Author John Keahey is not content to let images from the island's overly touristed villages carry the story. Starting in Palermo, he journeyed to such places as Arab-founded Scopello on the west coast, the Greek ruins of Selinunte on the southwest, and Sciascia's ancestral village of Racalmuto in the south, where he experienced unique, local festivals. He spent Easter Week in Enna at the island's center, witnessing surreal processions that date back to Spanish rule. And he learned about Sicilian cuisine in Spanish Baroque Noto and Greek Siracusa in the southeast, and met elderly, retired fishermen in the tiny east-coast fishing village of Aci Trezza, home of the mythical Cyclops and immortalized by Luchino Visconti's mid-1940s film masterpiece, <i>La terra trema</i>. He walked near the summit of Etna, Europe's largest and most active volcano, studied the mountain's role in creating this island, and looked out over the expanse of the Ionian Sea, marveling at the three millennia of myths and history that forged Sicily into what it is today.</p></p><p><p>JOHN KEAHEY is a veteran newspaper journalist who, since 1989, has been a reporter and news editor for The Salt Lake Tribune. He has a history degree from the University of Utah and spends as much time as possible in Italy.</p>ONE <br>&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;A Leopard in Very Bad Trim&#x201d; <br> <br>Don Fabrizio could not know it then, but a great deal of the slackness and acquiescence for which the people of the South were to be criticized during the next decades was due to the stupid annulment of the first expression of liberty ever offered them. <br> <br>&#x2014;Giuseppe di Lampedusa, <i>The Leopard</i> (1960) <br> <br>&#x201c;IN SICILY, &#x2018;no&#x2019; often becomes &#x2018;yes&#x2019;!&#x201d; <br>So proclaims Claudio Cutrona as we scramble down scaffolding erected against a nondescript building just a few blocks from the port of Palermo. It is a bright March morning in 2010 under a cloudless sky near the heart of Palermo&#x2019;s old town. The day before, Claudio, my host at a bed-and-breakfast tucked nearby in a narrow medieval-era street of the Vucciria, had obtained permission from a group of painters to let us climb their scaffolding. From that perch, we could look down into the ruined grounds of the neighboring compound that holds the busted-up remains of the fabled Palazzo Lampedusa. <br>The palazzo, in much gentler times, had been the home since his birth there in 1897 of Giuseppe di Lampedusa, author of the great Sicilian masterpiece, <i>Il gattopardo</i> ( <i>The Leopard</i>) <i>,</i> a novel that is a must-read for anyone who wants insight into Sicilians and how they became who they are, separate both culturally and emotionally from the rest of Italy. <br>Locked doorways and stone walls, perhaps fifteen feet high, had closed off the 1,600-square-yard compound for the past sixty-seven years. An Allied bomb, dropped on April 5, 1943, and aimed at German and Italian ships in the nearby Port of Palermo, missed its target, blasting the palazzo apart, turning its western wing to chunks of stone and shattered plaster; its eastern wing, still standing, was peeled open like a can of beans, exposing rooms, some with ceiling frescoes and huge carved-stone fireplaces, to decades of rain and wind. <br>Briefly, in the years immediately following the war, brick-making equipment had been set up in the rubble, complete with a tin roof held up on hastily poured concrete pillars. It served to help rebuild portions of bomb-damaged central Palermo. But that manufacturing site, too, was abandoned and the compound was closed off. <br>Now this space, with its jumble of stones and large trees, palms and hardwoods springing out of the destruction, is inexplicably full of workers. From the scaffold, we watch them cut up the woody vegetation and haul it away. <br>Claudio, from his perch, shouts down, asking one of the men piling up great chunks of freshly cut tree limbs if we can come in. His curt response: &#x201c;No! It is too dangerous.&#x201d; <br>Then, the man in charge, an architect who joins the workers during this discussion, shouts up, asking Claudio why we want to come inside. Told that an American writer, an admirer of Giuseppe Tomasi, prince of Lampedusa, and his great Sicilian novel, is with him, the young architect doesn&#x2019;t hesitate. &#x201c;Yes! Of course,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Come around the wall and enter through the small doorway from Via Bara all&#x2019;Olivella.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The bombs that laid waste in 1943 to much of central Palermo and this once magnificent palazzo were preparing the way for the Allied invasion of Sicily. Some of the destruction was not Allied-caused, however. German sappers set explosives throughout the city center in preparation for their army&#x2019;s departure. The island had been under the control of Axis troops of Germans and Italians. The Allied invasion, launched from newly conquered North Africa, began at the island&#x2019;s south shore the night of July 9. On July 22, American general George Patton&#x2019;s army, after slogging its way in a northwestern sweep from Gela and Licata, entered Palermo against light resistance, the Germans by then far to the east. <br>Sicilians, digging out of the rubble of war, generally welcomed the Allied invaders just as they had initially welcomed Garibaldi and his red-shirted army of one thousand&#x2013;plus northern Italians eighty-three years before. They were eager to get out from under German and fascist domination. That, plus many of the U.S. soldiers were first- and second-generation Sicilian-Americans whose families had immigrated to America decades earlier. <br>Sicilians, I suspect, also saw this twentieth-century war as a chance to declare their independence from Italy, a once grand but now unrealistic idea that had faded over the decades. Sicilian separatists, along with their neighbors in Sardinia to the northwest, eventually were silenced with the Italian government&#x2019;s offer to make the islands into autonomous, self-governing regions. Today, there may be some self-governing, but Rome still calls most of the shots. <br>The battle for Sicily ended August 17, 1943, when what was left of the German army, some sixty thousand troops, skipped across the Strait of Messina onto the toe of southern Italy. Italy surrendered on September 3 and became an ally of the Americans and British. Allied troops did not take Rome until June 1944, and it took nearly another brutal, bloody year before Italy was completely reclaimed. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>We scramble down the scaffolding and retrace our steps along the east wall of the palazzo, the most intact part of the building. Our pathway along this edge goes through what used to be the narrow garden of the Oratory of Saint Zita, a building still located on the other side of the open space. The garden is now gone; it is simply a patch of dirt where vehicles for the workers were parked. <br>Lampedusa&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s dressing room had been on the third floor on this side of the once glorious palace. Lampedusa, in autobiographical writings, tells us that her room had two balconies overlooking the garden and offering a view that remained ripe in Giuseppe&#x2019;s memory until his death in 1957, just months before <i>Il gattopardo</i> was published. Today, those balconies, and the nine others that dominated the front of the palace along Via Lampedusa, are gone. <br>I am excited to be invited inside. The location of the palazzo had come to my attention the previous November. Via Lampedusa, a narrow street that, a hundred years before, knew the clatter of horse-drawn carriages used by the wealthy and ancient Lampedusa clan, was closed off at both ends, as were the large wooden gates leading into the compound. Around the corner, a small doorway led through the protective stone wall along Via Bara all&#x2019;Olivella. It also was shuttered and locked. Peeking through a crack, I could see only junglelike foliage and tumbled masonry. <br>Via Lampedusa was blocked off because just across the street the Bank of Sicily was renovating the Branciforte Palace, also a sixteenth-century structure. It will become a museum hosting painting and sculpture exhibits. Its restoration architect, Gae Aulenti, created the Mus�e d&#x2019;Orsay in Paris out of a former train station. <br>During that first visit in November 2009, a construction worker had let me through the gate closing off the street so I could see the front wall of the sealed-off Palazzo Lampedusa compound. He had stood with me as I looked over the ruined, crumbling fa�ade of this once great building. <br>Shrugging, he said simply: <i>&#x201c;Nessuno. Abbandonato per molti anni. Si</i> <i>�</i> <i>rovinato, perduto.&#x201d;</i> (No one. Abandoned for many years. It is ruined, lost.) <br>Now just four months later, we are greeted warmly at that small door through the wall, held wide open by Gabriele Graziano and Alice Franzitta, two thirtysomething Palermitani who introduce themselves as architects. We step into the bombed-out area, gingerly dodging workmen hauling out the great chunks of freshly toppled trees. <br>This place had a small role in <i>The Leopard</i> (printed in English in 1960). It is a novel, a bit of historical fiction manufactured by Giuseppe di Lampedusa. He based it loosely on his grandfather, Giulio Tomasi (1815&#x2013;1885), called in the book by the name Don Fabrizio Corbera, prince of Salina. <br>The book, a blockbuster when it was published posthumously in Italian, was made into a 1963 film by Luchino Visconti. It starred Burt Lancaster as the prince and Claudia Cardinale as Angelica, the bride-to-be of Fabrizio&#x2019;s nephew, Tancredi, played by Alain Delon. It tells the story of an aristocratic Bourbon family and the impact Garibaldi&#x2019;s invasion of Sicily in the name of Italian Unification had on its members. <br>In the book and film, Tancredi convinces his uncle of the need for Garibaldi to overthrow the island&#x2019;s Bourbon rulers and bring Sicily into Italy. He speaks the oft-repeated lines that seem to sum up a classic Sicilian attitude: &#x201c;Unless we ourselves take a hand now, they&#x2019;ll foist a republic on us. If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change. D&#x2019;you understand?&#x201d; <br>Now, standing here in the midst of this long-hidden, bombed-out place, I discover that my timing is remarkable. Gabriele and Alice tell us that the workers began to clear out the trees and the rubble just one week earlier. Soon the rest of the ruined structure will be torn down, leveling a three-story building whose foundations were laid in 1480, and expanded upon in 1505, before being acquired by the Lampedusa family in 1788. <br>&#x201c;It is impossible to save any of it for restoration,&#x201d; Gabriele said sadly. <br>The two architects, along with another colleague, Sabina Padrut, have been given a remarkable opportunity: the rebuilding of Palazzo Lampedusa. <br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Gabriele says, &#x201c;we cannot replicate the interior. But the exterior will be as it originally was, before the bombing. The property is owned by thirty people. They created a foundation, and we will build apartments for each of the owners.&#x201d; <br>There will actually be thirty-one units, he says. The extra one may, or may not, be for sale when the project is complete in five years. I have to remember: This is Sicily, where nothing seems to get done according to schedule. <br>Short of that reality, this is exciting news. Many buildings in Palermo have been rebuilt over the decades following the war; many others are in desperate need of restoration. Some, in the port area and in the medieval market section of the Vucciria in one of the city&#x2019;s oldest areas, are still in ruins, untouched since the aerial bombardment of World War II. Even in the heart of the city, some of the buildings along busy thoroughfares are abandoned. And many balconies on both occupied and unoccupied buildings are closed off and shrouded in heavy netting to keep pieces of stone and rusted iron railing from falling onto passersby below. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Giuseppe di Lampedusa, who wrote <i>The Leopard</i> late in life, in the opening chapter of an autobiography he started but never finished, &#x201c;Places of My Infancy,&#x201d; offers a good description of his family&#x2019;s palace on Via Lampedusa. If the architects are true to their word&#x2014;and I have no doubt that they are&#x2014;they have a solid literary blueprint to follow. <br>Giuseppe and his parents lived in one wing, the one on the east end; his paternal grandparents occupied the other wing; bachelor uncles lived on the second floor. There were &#x201c;three courtyards, four terraces, garden, huge staircases, halls, corridors, stables, rooms on the mezzanine for servants and offices&#x2014;a real kingdom for a boy alone, a kingdom either empty or sparsely populated by figures unanimously well-disposed.&#x201d; <br>Lampedusa was inclined, in later life, not to call it a palace. He preferred Casa Lampedusa, the &#x201c;house&#x201d; of Lampedusa, believing the word &#x201c;palace&#x201d; had been debased in modern Italy. <br>As for the fa�ade that the architects promise to replicate, Lampedusa said it had &#x201c;no particular architectural merit.&#x201d; It was made of white stone. The borders around the windows were &#x201c;sulfur yellow, in purest Sicilian style of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.&#x201d; The front along Via Lampedusa ran for seventy yards, he wrote, with wide gates near each corner, and across an upper floor were strung nine balconies. <br>This palace was the family&#x2019;s townhome in the 1860s when the novel takes place. Of course, the Lampedusa descendants, including the author&#x2019;s family, occupied it nearly full-time during the twentieth century; Giuseppe last slept in it just two months before it was ripped asunder by the Allied bomb. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Most of the book&#x2019;s events take place in two other Lampedusa palaces owned by the family of the fictional prince: one is a palazzo on the northern outskirts of Palermo on the Piana dei Colli, today a scene for concerts and art exhibitions. This palace occupies the opening scenes in both the book and the film with the family kneeling in prayer during a private Mass. The other principal site for both book and movie is the fictional Donnafugata in southwest Sicily, based on the ancestral country estate of Lampedusa&#x2019;s mother. <br>As for the house in Palermo, the site of the architects&#x2019; ambitious restoration project, it is referred to in the movie only as a place where the prince stashes his carriage when he rides into town, accompanied by his personal priest, to meet with a prostitute&#x2014;after he drops the priest at his order&#x2019;s monastery. And when Garibaldi&#x2019;s Red Shirts are about to enter Palermo, the prince sends his eldest son, Paolo, from the palace on Piana dei Colli to occupy the townhome, saying the structure, if it were empty, would be a tempting prize for an invader. <br>At the book&#x2019;s end, in a section not replicated in the film, the dying prince is returning from Naples, where he has seen physicians for his deteriorating health. The family decides to put him up in a Palermo hotel rather than the nearby palazzo because &#x201c;the house was not in order&nbsp;&#x2026; it was used only for occasional luncheons by the sea; there wasn&#x2019;t even a bed in it.&#x201d; <br>While in a room in that hotel, the Hotel Trinacria, which was a real place in the late 1800s and early twentieth century, the prince observes himself in a mirror. &#x201c;He recognized his own suit more than himself: very tall and emaciated, with sunken cheeks and three days&#x2019; growth of beard&nbsp;&#x2026; A leopard in very bad trim. Why, he wondered, did God not want anyone to die with his own face on?&#x201d; <br>Giuseppe di Lampedusa, before the bomb, had imagined himself dying in the family&#x2019;s Palermo home, in the same room he had occupied since childhood, just a few feet from where his mother gave birth to him. Her room was &#x201c;very lovely, its ceiling scattered with flowers and branches of old coloured stucco, in a design gentle and corporeal as a piece of music by Mozart.&#x201d; <br>I saw a photograph in March 2010, taken by the architects, of that ceiling painting. Neither Giuseppe nor the prince made it home, each dying in strange places, alone with their memories. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Reading <i>The Leopard</i> was a significant step in attempting to understand Sicily and Sicilians. Through the dialogue of the characters, principally the prince of Salina and his nephew, Tancredi, Giuseppe di Lampedusa progressively reveals how Sicilians are the way they are and how they differ from mainland Italians. <br>The prince is a man of the privileged upper class that has flourished for generations under the Bourbon rulers based in Naples. He senses that change is coming and works to adapt to it so his and his family&#x2019;s way of life will continue. He has taken Tancredi, the son of a sister, under his wing and, it seems, has much more feeling for him as a son than as his nephew. Tancredi is a cynic in the true Italian sense of the word: one who readily adapts to changing circumstances and who can shift loyalties when it&#x2019;s convenient. He joins Garibaldi and the red-shirted One Thousand to free Sicily ...</p><h2>Nine O&#39;Clock In The Morning</h2><p>Nine O&#39;clock in the Morning is the story of what took place in Dennis Bennett&#39;s church in Van Nuys, CA., after he preached a Sunday morning sermon on April 3, 1960 about the underground Pentecostal Movement that was quietly racing through so many churches in America. When he then announced that he, himself, had spoken in tongues, an instant explosion went off in his church. The story was later carried in the local newspapers, various wires services picked it up, and the news swept the country. Time carried the story. So did Newsweek.</p><p>Reverend Dennis Bennett (1917&#x2013;1991) was born in England on October 28, 1917, the son of a Congregational minister. In 1949, he was ordained into the Congregational church, but in 1952 became ordained as an Episcopal priest. He was "prominently identified with the charismatic renewal from the beginning.The movement is usually dated from the Sunday morning in 1959 when Bennett announced to his congregation in Van Nuys, California, that he had been baptized with the Holy Spirit and had spoken in tongues. As a result, a small opposition group in the congregation challenged him to cease and desist from what later came to be called charismatic experiences. He voluntarily resigned his pastorate, feeling that he did not have adequate understanding to defend his position. In 1960, he accepted an invitation to become vicar of St. Luke's Episcopal Church in Seattle, Washington. Within six years the little mission church had become a strong parish. For a decade it was a major center from which word of baptism with the Holy Spirit would spread worldwide, especially in the mainline denominations. Thousands of people experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit as a result of hearing Bennett's testimony.</p><h2>Falling Up Special Edition: With 12 New Poems</h2><p><p><strong>From <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Shel Silverstein, the creator of the classics&nbsp;<em>Where the Sidewalk Ends</em>, <em>A Light in the Attic, </em>and <em>Every Thing On It,</em> comes a wondrous book of poems and drawings.</strong></p><p>This special edition contains 12 never-before-published poems.

The far-off colony of New Svalbard, cut off from the rest of the galaxy by the Lanky blockade, teeters on the verge of starvation and collapse.

He&#39;s a rabbit bodyguard, a samurai who wanders the mountains, plains, and villages of a 17th-century Japan populated almost exclusively by anthropomorphic animals. Cats, snakes, rhinos, and ninja moles plot and fight their way across a land ravaged by civil war. The 10 stories in this first collection introduce Usagi, the evil Lord Hikiji, and a host of other characters. The stories themselves can stand alone, but taken together they begin to form an ongoing saga of treachery and revenge. Sometimes violent, sometimes funny, Usagi&#39;s adventures are filled with fascinating historical detail.

Of all the problems the Old Testament poses for our modern age, this is the one we want to avoid in mixed company. But do the so-called holy war texts of the Old Testament portray a divinely inspired genocide? Did Israel slaughter Canaanites at God's command? Were they enforcing divine retribution on an unholy people? These texts shock us. And we turn the page. But have we rightly understood them? In <em>The Lost World of the Israelite Conquest</em>, John Walton and J. Harvey Walton take us on an archaeological dig, excavating the layers of translation and interpretation that over time have encrusted these texts and our perceptions. What happens when we take new approaches, frame new questions? When we weigh again their language and rhetoric? Were the Canaanites punished for sinning against the covenanting God? Does the Hebrew word <em>herem</em> mean "devote to destruction"? How are the Canaanites portrayed and why? And what happens when we backlight these texts with their ancient context? <em>The Lost World of the Israelite Conquest</em> keenly recalibrates our perception and reframes our questions. While not attempting to provide all the answers, it offers surprising new insights and clears the ground for further understanding.</p><p>John H. Walton (PhD, Hebrew Union College) is professor of Old Testament at Wheaton College and Graduate School. Previously he was professor of Old Testament at Moody Bible Institute in Chicago for twenty years. Some of Walton's books include <em>The Lost World of Adam and Eve, The Lost World of Scripture, The Lost World of Genesis One, Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament, The Essential Bible Companion, The NIV Application Commentary: Genesis</em> and <em>The IVP Bible Background Commentary: Old Testament</em> (with Victor Matthews and Mark Chavalas). Walton's ministry experience includes church classes for all age groups, high school Bible studies and adult Sunday school classes, as well as serving as a teacher for "The Bible in 90 Days." John and his wife, Kim, live in Wheaton, Illinois, and have three adult children."The conquest of Canaan is arguably the most intractable ethical problem in the Bible, and to date no solution has garnered a consensus. These authors offer a genuinely fresh approach to mitigate the difficulties. Deeply rooted in ancient Near Eastern mores and reconsideration of key biblical words and texts, the arguments challenge many commonly held ideas. While provocative at times, this book deserves careful consideration." (John W. Hilber, professor of Old Testament, Grand Rapids Theological Seminary)<br><br>"The violence in the book of Joshua has long vexed devoted Bible readers. The father and son authors of this fine volume offer a fresh, more pacific reading of the book in light of what they deem to be relevant ancient Near Eastern parallels. They present their case in a series of propositions that rebut inadequate (in their view) modern solutions and support their alternative view with impressive close rereadings of biblical and extrabiblical texts and illuminating Hebrew word studies. They argue, for example, that the Hebrew verb <em>herem</em> means 'to remove from use,' not 'to annihilate,' and that its application to human communities 'is intended to destroy identity, not to kill people.' Indeed, ancient cultural ideas of order (versus disorder), identity (not ethnicity), and the suzerain-vassal model of what the authors call 'covenant order' drive their argument. Ultimately, they demonstrate that to read the Bible from an ancient (versus modern) perspective may yield a clearer, less distorted understanding of its controversial topics. They have proffered a commendable, thorough, thought-provoking rethinking of violence in Joshua and its implications for Christian identity today." (Robert L. Hubbard Jr., professor emeritus of biblical literature, North Park Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Into the many recent discussions concerning the ethical and moral problems of the Israelite conquest, Walton and Walton offer a much needed corrective, effectively arguing that to properly understand these troublesome texts one needs to interpret them in light of their ancient context. They boldly challenge common assumptions regarding the conquest, carefully examine biblical and ancient Near Eastern texts, and helpfully guide readers to apply these lessons, using them as a template to make sense of the New Testament." (David T. Lamb, Allan A. MacRae Professor of Old Testament, Biblical Theological Seminary, author of God Behaving Badly and Prostitutes and Polygamists)<br><br>"The Waltons have a provocative thesis that revises many popular and traditional views. They are attentive students of the Bible and its ancient context, and their argument is detailed. Bible readers who have wrestled with the implications of the conquest will find this work helpful."

This text has been studied, practiced, and expounded upon in an unbroken tradition for centuries. Presented in the form of a personal meditation in verse, it outlines the path of the Bodhisattvas&#x2014;those who renounce the peace of individual enlightenment and vow to work for the liberation of all beings and to attain buddhahood for their sake.</p><p>This version is translated from the Tibetan and includes a foreword by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, a translator&#x2019;s preface, a thorough introduction, a note on the translation, and three appendices of commentary by the Nyingma master Kunzang Pelden.</p></p><p>Shantideva was an Indian Buddhist while Buddhism still flourished in India. His great work, the <i>Bodhicharyavatara</i>, or "Entrance to the Path of Awakening," became a major text of Tibetan Buddhism long after it went out of circulation in its homeland. It is a handbook on how to realize the nature of existence and of compassion that arises from such realization. The Dalai Lama said of it, "If I have any understanding of compassion and the practice of the Bodhisattva path, it is entirely on the basis of this text that I possess it." Like the <i>Book of Proverbs</i>, the <i>Bodhicharyavatara</i> is a timeless work of wisdom, the longevity of which is due to the quality of its verse as much as to its wisdom. For the first time, an attempt has been made to recover that poetic immediacy by rendering the text in iambic lines. <blockquote> Regard your body as a vessel,<br> A simple boat for going here and there.<br> Make of it a wish-fulfilling gem<br> To bring about the benefit of beings.<br> </blockquote> With this translation, gleaming in its clarity, a Buddhist classic becomes an English classic. Worthy of recitation and committing to memory, Shantideva's words on such topics as doing good, reading sutras, guarding the mind, keeping good company, and on the nature of the mind and reality can take on a life of their own, to grow and blossom in a new native tongue. The text booms, like the voice of a Shakespearean actor, as if it were not the bodhisattva but the book itself that proclaims: <blockquote> And now as long as space endures,<br> As long as there are beings to be found,<br> May I continue likewise to remain<br> To drive away the sorrows of the world.<br> </blockquote> <i>--Brian Bruya</i>One of the great classics of Mahayana Buddhism," The Way of the Bodhisattva ("Bodhicharyavatara) is a guide to cultivating the mind of enlightenment, and to generating the qualities of love, compassion, generosity, and patience. Presented in the form of a personal meditation in verse, it outlines the path of the bodhisattvas-those beings who renounce the peace of an individual salvation and vow to work for the deliverance of all beings, and to attain enlightenment for their sake. The text is beloved by Buddhists of all traditions.<br>Originally written in India in Sanskrit, the text first appeared in Tibetan translation in the eighth century. The fact that it has been expounded, studied, and practiced in Tibet in an unbroken tradition lends the Tibetan version of the "Bodhicharyavatara a particular authority. The present version has therefore been translated from the Tibetan, following a commentary by the Nyingma master Kunzang Pelden, renowned for its thoroughness, clarity, and accessibility.</p><h2>Who Needs Donuts?</h2><p>Sam&#x2019;s love of donuts takes him to the Big City where he makes friends with Mr. Bikferd, a world class collector of donuts. But when Mr. Bikferd falls in love with Pretzel Annie, the prophecy of an old homeless woman comes true: &#x201c;Who needs donuts when you&#x2019;ve got love?&#x201d; Mr. Bikferd bequeaths his donut collection to Sam, who uses it to save the old homeless woman from drowning in a basement flooded with coffee. <br><br>This is a reissue of Mark Alan Stamaty&#x2019;s masterpiece of the absurd, first published 30 years ago and out of print nearly as long. With an illustration style that mixes a benign Hieronymus Bosch with an urban <i>Where&#x2019;s Waldo?</i>, Stamaty&#x2019;s off-the-wall humor is on target for little kids and big kids today.</p><p>Originally published in 1973, <i>Who Needs Donuts</i> is a sweet visual feast that will have kids (and nostalgic parents) poring over its rich tableaus for hours. Every inch of each black-and-white page is covered in detailed, delightful drawings, at times bringing to mind the two-dimensional cartoons of Saul Steinberg, at others the scratchy realism of Lynda Barry&#x2019;s comics. In fact, there is so much to look at in this short, simple story that new discoveries are sure to be made with each successive reading (of which there are bound to be countless). <p> Young Sam, clad (inexplicably, yet charmingly) in cowboy duds, already has a nice house with a big yard and lots of friends, but he feels nonetheless that something is missing. He mounts his trusty trike and heads for the big city in search of one thing: donuts, and not just a few, but "More than his mother and father could ever buy him." </p><p> His quest is rife with humor and adventure, not to mention a man in paisley suit and a woman named Pretzel Annie. Kids will adore the no-holds-barred kookiness displayed throughout (a street vendor selling fried oranges with optional mayonnaise; a "self-service" restaurant where the waiters look exactly like the customers), and adults will smile at the hippie-era moral that love is all you need. As the flap illustration warns, "This book is addictive," but this sugar habit need not be kicked.

During this period, accelerated change saw Britain&#x2019;s turbulent entry into the modern age, and clothing reflected these transformations. Starting with the intimate perspective of clothing the self, <i>Dress in the Age of Jane Austen</i> moves outward through the social and cultural spheres of home, village, countryside, and cities, and into the wider national and global realms, exploring the varied ways people dressed to inhabit these environments. Jane Austen&#x2019;s famously observant fictional writings, as well as her letters, provide the entry point for examining the Regency age&#x2019;s rich complexity of fashion, dress, and textiles for men and women in their contemporary contexts.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lavishly illustrated with paintings, drawings, historic garments, and fashion plates&#x2014;including many previously unpublished images&#x2014;this authoritative yet accessible book will help readers visualize the external selves of Austen&#x2019;s immortal characters as clearly as she wrote of their internal ones. The result is an enhanced understanding of Austen&#x2019;s work and time, and also of the history of one of Britain&#x2019;s most distinctive fashion eras.</p><p>This beautifully illustrated book explores the rich complexity of Regency clothing through the lens of the collected writings of Jane Austen.<b>Hilary Davidson</b> is a dress and textile historian based between Britain and Australia, and an Honorary Associate at the University of Sydney.

For instance, the Hybrid car has become the answer to Detroit's environmental and oil crisis issues. Finding the synergy between two technologies, gas and electric has created a new day for the auto industry. Likewise,&nbsp;<em>Spent Matches</em>explores how the church can find synergy between two seemingly competing thoughts: an invitation to come and a command to go.

Martyn Lloyd- Jones: The First Forty Years (I982) and The Fight of Faith (I990). Since those dates, the life of Dr Lloyd-Jones has been the subject of comment and assessment in many publications and these have been taken into account. The main purpose of this further biography, however, is to put Dr Lloyd-Jones' life before another generation in more accessible form. The big story is all here.<br><br>When Lloyd-Jones left medicine, he intended only to be an evangelist in a mission hall in South Wales. No one was more surprised than he in being called to a ministry which would eventually affect churches across the world. How this happened is here explained, but the theme is the person described by F. F. Bruce: 'a thoroughly humble man. He was a man of prayer, a powerful evangelist, an expository preacher of rare quality, in the fullest sense a servant of the Word of God.' <br><br>Behind that theme a greater one emerges. In ML- J's own words: 'My whole life experiences are proof of the sovereignty of God and his direct interference in the lives of men. I cannot help believing what I believe. I would be a madman to believe anything else-the guiding hand of God! It is an astonishment to me.

He also earned his chef's whites and began cooking professionally. Ruhlman ventures further into the secret lives of chefs with his second book, <i>The Soul of a Chef</i>. This enthusiastically researched report is divided into three parts: The first concerns the Certified Master Chef exam, a brutal weeklong cooking marathon that measures the skill levels of professional chefs. The second and third parts of Ruhlman's book are devoted to the careers of two different chefs, Michael Symon of Cleveland's Lola Bistro and Thomas Keller of Napa Valley's legendary French Laundry. The thread connecting these three tales together is Ruhlman's quest for culinary perfection: Does it exist? Is it possible? How is it even measurable? Ruhlman does indeed stumble onto the realization of his high-minded ideal, serving up a palatable conclusion for hard-core foodies equally obsessed with the perfect meal. <i>--Sumi Hahn Almquist</i><b>Michael Ruhlman&#x2019;s classic book on professional cooking&#x2014;winner of the IACP Cookbook Award</b><br><br>In his second in-depth foray into the world of professional cooking<b>, The Soul of a Chef</b>, Michael Ruhlman journeys into the heart of the profession.

R. R. Tolkien&#39;s wartime experiences and their impact on his life and his writing of The Lord of The Rings. To be caught in youth by 1914 was no less hideous an experience than in 1939 ... by 1918 all but one of my close friends were dead. So J. R. R. Tolkien responded to critics who saw The Lord of the Rings as a reaction to the Second World War. Tolkien and the Great War tells for the first time the full story of how he embarked on the creation of Middle-earth in his youth as the world around him was plunged into catastrophe. This biography reveals the horror and heroism that he experienced as a signals officer in the Battle of the Somme and introduces the circle of friends who spurred his mythology to life. It shows how, after two of these brilliant young men were killed, Tolkien pursued the dream they had all shared by launching his epic of good and evil. John Garth argues that the foundation of tragic experience in the First World War is the key to Middle-earth&#39;s enduring power. Tolkien used his mythic imagination not to escape from reality but to reflect and transform the cataclysm of his generatuion. While his contemporaries surrendered to disil</p><p>Millions of new captives of the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> saga have been roped into J.R.R. Tolkien&#x2019;s fantasy world as the result of Peter Jackson&#x2019;s three-part cinematic interpretation of the great 20th century fantasy. John Garth&#x2019;s <i>Tolkien and the Great War</i> will certainly captivate an elite segment of those recent converts, but it is written more for those who have long been enthralled by Middle-earth and its fantastic denizens. While many early readers found parallels between World War II and the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> fairy-tale, Garth reaches back to World War I to find the deep roots in Middle-earth. Prior to the Great War, Tolkien was a scholar with a deep passion for language and fables. In fact, he formed a literary circle with a few friends dubbed the Tea Club and Barrovian Society. Its members had the misfortune of coming of age just as the war was reaching a fevered pitch; Tolkien, a second lieutenant in the British army, survived the bloody Battle of the Somme, which took the lives of two of his closest friends. Garth adeptly chronicles how the devastation Tolkien witnessed helped shape the mythic tale that was already brewing in his mind. Written with a seriousness one associates with the time it chronicles, <i>Tolkien and the Great War</i> is a erudite but eminently readable exploration of how the harsh reality of the early 20th century colored one of the beloved fantasies of the modern era. <i>--Steven Stolder</i>John Garth is a Tolkien expert who has become acknowledged as the authority on Tolkien&#39;s wartime experiences, having appeared on The South Bank Show, on the Lord of the Rings DVDs and other documentaries about Tolkien. He studied English at Oxford University and spent five years researching and writing this book. He works as a freelance newspaper journalist in Oxford.</p><h2>Carnal Curiosity: A Stone Barrington Novel</h2><p><b>When crime hits Manhattan&#x2019;s rarefied circles, Stone Barrington finds himself in the bull&#x2019;s-eye in&nbsp;this #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i> bestseller.<br></b><br>Stone Barrington seems to have a knack for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

As Stone and Dino delve deeper into their investigation, they learn that the mastermind behind the incidents may have some intimate ties to Stone...and that the biggest heist is still to come.</p><p><b>Stuart Woods</b> is the author of more than sixty novels, including the #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling Stone Barrington series.

An avid sailor and pilot, Woods lives in Florida, Maine, and New Mexico.<i>1</i><br><br>Stone Barrington sat at his desk in the downstairs office of his Turtle Bay town house, poring over documents related to the finances of his new clients, Jack and Hillary Coulter.<br><br>Or, perhaps, Hillary and Jack Coulter, since she was the one with all the money, and there was a great deal of it. He added a couple of paragraphs to the memo he was sending to the tax and finance department of his law firm, Woodman &amp; Weld, where his suggestions would be reviewed to keep him out of trouble. His phone buzzed.<br><br>&#x201c;Your five-thirty appointment is here,&#x201d; his secretary, Joan, said.<br><br>&#x201c;I have a five-thirty?&#x201d; Stone asked, momentarily baffled.<br><br>&#x201c;The insurance adjuster, Crane Hart, from the Steele company?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, of course. Give me three minutes, then send him in.&#x201d; He clicked off before she could respond. He tidied the document on his computer, then e-mailed it, then he shuffled the papers on his desk into a fairly neat stack.<br><br>"Much better," a female voice said from the doorway.<br><br>''Ah, Mr. Hart," Stone said, not looking up. Then he looked up. "I perceive that you are not a mister," he said.<br><br>She was tall, wrapped in a suit too tight and with a skirt too short to be businesslike, and her bright, blonde hair was pulled tightly into something at the back of her head. He won�dered how she could blink, but she did, and slowly.<br><br>Before he could speak a moment of carnal curiosity flashed between them. ''Ah," he said, otherwise speechless. He finally managed speech. "I was expecting an insurance adjuster of the male persuasion."<br><br>''Ah," she replied. "A natural assumption, but Steele sends out tall, blonde, female adjusters when the loss is great enough." "I must remember to be robbed at gunpoint more often," he said, waving her toward the sofa, instead of the chair before his desk.<br><br>She took a seat and crossed her legs without undue expo- sure, an artful act, given the mininess of her skirt.<br><br>Stone came and sat at the other end of the sofa. "Now, about your loss," she said.<br><br>"Must we discuss that? I was beginning to think of this meeting as more of a gain."<br><br>She placed a briefcase on the sofa between them, unsnapped it, and extracted a file. "You're very kind," she said, "but first, your loss."<br><br>"If we must."<br><br>"We must." She consulted the file. "It says here that you were robbed of five hundred thousand dollars."<br><br>"Five million dollars," he corrected.<br><br>Her eyes opened perceptibly wider. "Then you require a taller, blonder adjuster."<br><br>"I recovered four and a half million dollars before filing my claim," he replied. "The present adjuster will do nicely."<br><br>"Do you have any evidence of this robbery?" she asked.<br><br>"I still have a bump on the back of my head," he said, gin�gerly touching the spot. "Anything on paper?"<br><br>"I have a bank statement showing a five-million-dollar with�drawal, and a redeposit of four and a half million a few days later."<br><br>"What happened to the other half million?"<br><br>"After I had been relieved of the five million-at gunpoint, I should add-the person who had taken it exchanged it for four and a half million."<br><br>"That seems an extremely unwise transaction," she pointed out.<br><br>"Not when you consider that the five million was in tens and twenties, and the exchange sum was in hundreds."<br><br>"You mean the villain paid half a million dollars to make it easier to count?"<br><br>"Count, transport, carry by hand, I believe it's called money laundering."<br><br>"Is there a police report covering any of this? Anything at all?"<br><br>Stone went to a desk drawer and came back with his bank statement and two documents, one a receipt from the Connecticut State Police and the other a police report on the theft from the NYPD.<br><br>"You seem well documented," she said admiringly, "and on this basis I will recommend that your claim be paid � immediately."<br><br>"Thank you."<br><br>"I expect we at Steele were fortunate to get off so light." "I expect you were."<br><br>"Now that we have concluded this matter, do you think you could tell me all of this story, just to satisfy my curiosity?"<br><br>"I can certainly do that," Stone said, "but not without induc�ing a terrible thirst. Would you like a drink?"<br><br>"A Belvedere martini, please," she replied without hesitation. "Very dry, straight up, olives."<br><br>"For anything more boisterous than brown whiskey over ice, we will have to adjourn to my study upstairs, where the materi�als for constructing your libation are readily available."<br><br>"You talked me into it," she said.<br><br>He led her upstairs and into his study, a small but comfort� ably furnished room with a bar concealed behind the paneling and an ice machine humming discreetly. She sat on the sofa, crossing her legs again, and waited while he assembled her drink, then poured himself a bourbon on the rocks. He handed her the martini glass.<br><br>She took a sip. "Perfect," she said. "I missed lunch. Do you have anything to snack on?"<br><br>Stone picked up the phone on the coffee table and pressed a button. "Fred," he said, "you have five minutes to put together some canap�s for two." He hung up.<br><br>"Who's Fred?"<br><br>"Frederick Flicker, an English butler who was a gift from a French friend."<br><br>"A gift?"<br><br>"A year of his services. After that, we negotiate."<br><br>"Is he concealed behind the paneling?"<br><br>"He's in the kitchen at this time of the day, no doubt canoo�dling with my cook and housekeeper, Helene."<br><br>She suddenly fixed her gaze on a spot across the room, then rose and approached a painting, examining it closely. "Is this one of the Matilda Stones listed on your policy?"<br><br>"It is. There's another behind you, a couple more in the living and dining rooms, and, best of all, the four she left me, hanging in the master suite."<br><br>"Left you?"<br><br>"Matilda Stone was my mother."<br><br>"Ahhhh, I should have deduced that. I'm not usually so slow on the uptake." She sat down again.<br><br>Fred appeared silently at the door, bearing a silver tray, which he set on the coffee table. "Helene's compliments: some prosciutto, some crumbles of Parmigiano-Reggiano, and a little of her pork rillettes," he announced, then he vanished.<br><br>"I should keep him on, if I were you," she said. "I fully intend to."<br><br>"May I see the other paintings?" she asked. "Of course."<br><br>"Including the four in the master suite?"<br><br>He smiled. "Of course. But let me fix us another drink first."<br><i>2</i><br><br>Stone put their drinks on a small tray and led the way to the elevator.<br><br>&#x201c;This is a very handsome house,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you. How did you come to be named Hart Crane in reverse?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My mother had never heard of the poet. Crane was her maiden name, much as your mother&#x2019;s was Stone. Hart was my father&#x2019;s name.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That makes perfect sense,&#x201d; Stone said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, but it doesn&#x2019;t make it any easier to live with. First there&#x2019;s the gender confusion, then the spelling, then the denial of a connection with the author, then, if I&#x2019;m lucky, people get it right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll make a note of it,&#x201d; Stone said. The elevator came to a halt, and Stone stepped out and nodded in the direction of the master suite. He followed her in, then set the tray on a bedside table and gave her what was left of her first martini. &#x201c;Bottoms up,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;So to speak.&#x201d;<br><br>She laughed.<br><br>They tossed off the last sip of their first drinks.<br><br>She smiled. "And those are the paintings," she said, travers�ing the room and standing reverently before the smallish oils. "Ahhhh."<br><br>"I'm glad you appreciate them."<br><br>"I paint a little, and that makes me appreciate them all the more."<br><br>"Your second drink," he said, offering the tray.<br><br>"First, I'll bet there's a bathroom in this suite."<br><br>"Mine is to your left, yours is to your right."<br><br>She chose the one to the right and was back in a flash, accept�ing and sipping her new martini.<br><br>"That was fast," Stone said, sipping his new bourbon.<br><br>"It doesn't take long to take off your underwear," she said, as if to herself.<br><br>He froze for a moment. "I hope you meant what I think you said," he said.<br><br>"I try to speak clearly," she replied, "even after a martini."<br><br>He reached tentatively under her skirt and encountered a firm, smooth buttock.<br><br>"Mmmm," she said, taking another sip of her martini and facing the paintings again.<br><br>He stood behind her and kissed her on an ear. "Perfect hairdo for an available ear," he breathed, and he noticed that his respi�ration had gone up about ten points.<br><br>She reached into her hair and released something, and it fell around her shoulders in thick, glossy waves. "It works both ways," she said, and she sounded a little breathless, too.<br><br>He reached around her and cupped a breast in his hand. It felt just wonderful. Emboldened, he undid her top button, reached inside, located a nipple and squeezed.<br><br>"You've found the start button," she said, reaching behind her and feeling the front of his trousers.<br><br>"So have you."<br><br>She found the zipper and pulled it slowly down. "I believe I have," she said, reaching inside and taking him in her hand. "Isn't there a bed somewhere in this room?" She turned to face him and began working on his belt buckle.<br><br>His trousers fell to the floor, and he stepped out of them. "The bed is this way," he said, pulling her across the space of six feet. They finished undressing before falling onto the bed, not bothering with the covers.<br><br>Half an hour later they lay in each other's arms, breathing deeply.<br><br>"I feel well adjusted now," he said.<br><br>"Adjustment is my metier," she said. ''Are you up to doing it again?" She took him in her hand again to focus his attention. &#x201c;Yes, I believe you are."<br><br>They did it again, this time more slowly. "I'm hungry," she said a few minutes later.<br><br>"What would you like to eat?"<br><br>"You mean, in addition to what I've just had?" "Whatever you want."<br><br>''A steak."<br><br>"What kind of steak?"<br><br>''A prime strip."<br><br>"I thought I'd already done that."<br><br>"Medium rare," she said.<br><br>"Something on the side?"<br><br>She laughed. "Green beans and some sort of potatoes."<br><br>"Something to start?"<br><br>"A Caesar salad."<br><br>Stone picked up the phone, reached Fred, and ordered for them. "And a bottle of the Far Niente Cabernet, decanted." He hung up and returned to her.<br><br>She snuggled into his shoulder. "I hope you're surprised by all this," she said, "because I certainly am."<br><br>"I love a surprise," he replied, stroking her hair.<br><br>"There was a moment, when I stood in the door and watched you stacking papers."<br><br>"The moment for me came just after that," he said.<br><br>"I'm not this way with all my adjustees."<br><br>"I should hope not-you'd be continually exhausted." "I'm not exhausted yet," she said.<br><br>"Oh, God."<br><br>"You'll be ready again after a steak."<br><br>"You could be right."<br><br>"When I'm right, I'm right."<br><br>Their food arrived on the dumbwaiter. Stone sat up the two electrically operated beds and put the tray between them. Fred had decanted the wine, and Stone poured large glasses.<br><br>"So," he said, "how did I get so lucky?"<br><br>"Luck of the draw," she said. "I mean, I could have scheduled the old lady whose cat knocked over a candle and set her bed� room on fire. Besides, I'll bet you're lucky a lot."<br><br>"Not this lucky."<br><br>"I'm surprised you're not married."<br><br>"Widowed," he said.<br><br>"How long?"<br><br>''A while. You?"<br><br>"Divorced for three years. Much happier single."<br><br>"How did you get into insurance?"<br><br>"My ex-husband was a private investigator. I used to help, and I got pretty good at it. After the divorce I applied at Steele, and they found my investigative experience a good fit for sniff�ing out insurance fraud."<br><br>"Did they suspect me of fraud?" Stone asked.<br><br>"Oh, no. There was a lull in those cases, and I drew yours."<br><br>"Did you know I'm their attorney?"<br><br>"Who?"<br><br>"Steele."<br><br>"You're kidding."<br><br>"No, they came to me through Strategic Services, another client."<br><br>"I certainly know who <i>they </i>are. I'd love to work there."<br><br>"Maybe you should meet their CEO, Mike Freeman."<br><br>"Love to. Will you introduce me?"<br><br>"It's the least I can do after all you've done for me."<br><br>She laughed aloud at that. "You're right."<br><br>They finished their dinner, sent the tray back downstairs, and made love again.<br><i>3</i><br><br>Crane stayed the night, and in the morning Stone put her in a cab. &#x201c;I had a lovely evening and night,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Would you like to try for that again this evening? There&#x2019;s a cocktail party, and then we can get some dinner.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What time?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pick you up at seven. Where do you live?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Five-seventy Park. How shall I dress?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a better judge of that than I. I&#x2019;ll wear a suit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;See you at seven.&#x201d; They kissed, and he closed the door.<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Joan said as he came into his office. &#x201c;You have a rosy glow. Your insurance adjustment must have gone well.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My claim will be forwarded with the adjuster&#x2019;s approval.&#x201d;<br><br>Joan grinned. &#x201c;I take it undue influence may have been brought to bear.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Kindly shut up and go to work,&#x201d; he said. Joan was always interested in his sex life.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir!&#x201d; She vanished.<br><br>Stone sat down and found himself reintroduced to the paperwork of Mrs. and Mr. Jack Coulter. He reread his memo to Tax and Finance and decided he had covered all the bases. "Joan!" he yelled.<br><br>She came back into his office. "We have this newfangled thing called a buzzer," she said.<br><br>"You need the exercise," he reposted. He scooped up the papers on his desk and handed them to her. Sort these into some sort of sane filings. I'll e-mail you my memo to Tax and Finance, and you can messenger the lot over to them."<br><br>She hefted the stack of paper. "Feels like a major new client, if we're starting at this weight."<br><br>"I believe that will be the case. Your experience with my file should be of use. You might use that as a template."<br><br>"Will do." She vanished, and after a moment, buzzed him. "See? A buzzer! Dino on one."<br><br>Stone sighed and picked up the phone. "Good morning, Chief," he said. Dino had been the new chief of detectives of the NYPD for some time now. "You and Viv going to the Strategic Services shindig tonight?"<br><br>"It's a free meal, isn't it?"<br><br>"Is it? I was thinking just cocktails."<br><br>"I can smell a free meal all the way downtown."<br><br>"Okay, I have a date. Join us for dinner, whether there or elsewhere."<br><br>"If it's free, we're there."<br><br>"Then I hope that Mike Freeman provides."<br><br>"Who's the date?"<br><br>"Somebody new. Her name is Crane Hart." He spelled it.<br><br>"How new?"<br><br>"Brand spanking new. I think you'll approve."<br><br>"I approved of the last one, and she stole five million bucks from you."<br><br>"Well, your judgment of women was never that great."<br><br>"How about <i>your </i>judgment?

The range will be greatly diminished but they&#x2019;ll still be deadly up close. You keep this in mind in case you ever find yourself in a swimming pool or creek engaging an armed suspect. Your gun may work just fine in the drink. But then again, the suspect&#x2019;s might too.<br><br>2. When you approach someone on the street to talk to them and they turn their right side away from you, it sets you on high alert. That&#x2019;s because it&#x2019;s human nature for suspects carrying concealed firearms to turn their gun side (which is more often than not their right side) away from the police. This is not normal behavior for law-abiding people, who tend to talk to you face to face. You also want to watch the style and manner of dress of the people you approach. Criminals carrying concealed weapons often wear baggy untucked shirts or have their coats partially unbuttoned in winter, so they can have ready access to their weapon. They also like to keep their gun hand tight against their body as they walk in order to secure it, and, because their gun shifts position as they move, they make a series of sometimes subtle and sometimes not-so-subtle pats, taps, and tugs to ensure the firearm is still in place. These are known as &#x201c;gun retention movements&#x201d; in police parlance, a phrase you want to include in the report when you make a firearm arrest.<br><br>3. If you&#x2019;re trying to help a seriously injured gunshot victim and hear his ragged breathing, it probably isn&#x2019;t breathing at all. It&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s known as agonal respirations, the hard rattle in the throat immediately preceding death. You still do what you can for them. You try to staunch the bleeding. You start CPR. But they&#x2019;re already well on their way to the next world. Your life-saving efforts aren&#x2019;t altogether futile, but only because it&#x2019;s better to be doing something, like chest compressions, than just sitting there watching them die. <br><br>4. It will go against your natural instincts to fire your weapon through a solid surface in order to hit your target, but if it comes down to it, you can effectively shoot outgoing rounds from a seated position through your own squad car windshield with a minimum of glass spray. However, if you are fired upon through the same windshield, the glass blowback will cut your eyes and face and the trajectory of the incoming rounds won&#x2019;t lose any of their accuracy. <br><br>5. Shootings, particularly those that are gang-related, set into motion a wearying circle of retaliatory violence. The reports of shots fired keep pouring in all over the district, everyone&#x2019;s out, everyone&#x2019;s settling scores and as a cop, all you can do is investigate each one to the best of your ability, scramble to keep up and pray for rain. You know that while some shooting victims are innocents caught in the crossfire, many are career criminals who get shot because of some drug or gang-related activity they indulged in. That&#x2019;s why you pat them down for weapons, even if they&#x2019;re on a stretcher moaning in pain. You might find the gun they returned fire with. Nobody&#x2019;s your friend out there and today&#x2019;s victim is often tomorrow&#x2019;s suspect. <br><br>6. A handgun is the great equalizer in a fight. If you&#x2019;re armed, you don&#x2019;t need determination or training to prevail. You don&#x2019;t need courage or physical strength or fortitude. All you need is a trigger finger and the ability to exert around eight pounds of pressure with it. That&#x2019;s why the best cops are the ones who don&#x2019;t get overly confident when taking on suspects of small stature, or guys who don&#x2019;t look like much. If they have a gun, they can end you no matter what your mile-and-a-half time is or how much you can bench-press.<br> <br>7. Shotguns are heavy, especially if you have nothing to brace them on. It&#x2019;s enervating to hold them level at a target for an extended period of time. You want to lower the weapon mid-crisis and rest your leaden shoulders but then you&#x2019;ll feel like a wimp and a bad guy might riddle you with bullets. You just hope the situation resolves itself before your arms drop the hell off your torso.<br><br>26. Pre-Columbine, the police response to an active shooter (i.e. a gunman who is in the process of killing people) was to hold the perimeter and wait for the Tactical squad to enter with their long guns and ballistic shields. Active street cops resented these regulations, because they wanted to get in there and do their job. There was no time to wait for Tactical. Columbine showed they were right. The longer you wait, the worse it gets, because the active shooter probably has no expectation of going home alive and he is in a person-rich environment. So now police departments have completely revamped their approach. Now as a patrol cop, you and whomever you can round up go in right away with the mission of locating, isolating, and engaging the shooter. This means listening for the sounds of gunshots. This means stepping over the dead and ignoring the wounded. Until the shooter is neutralized, nothing else matters.<br><br>27. Once in a while, even with the deep-rooted cynicism that comes with the job, you&#x2019;ll get a casualty so raw that it gives you a moment of pause. Like a seven-year-old girl who is struck by stray gunfire while playing outside her house and who dies at the scene in front of her family. One minute she is skipping rope. The next, she&#x2019;s gone. And you read the rest of the news headlines that day. The government is unveiling a new food pyramid, which recommends one more serving of vegetables and one fewer of grains, and the price of gas is up three cents and Paris Hilton has a new fragrance out. And it all seems so stupid and petty. And no, the whole world doesn&#x2019;t come to a grinding halt just because a little girl is murdered on some corner in some city in America. But maybe, just for a little while, it should.</p><h2>Kabbalah, Magic &amp; the Great Work of Self Transformation: A Complete Course</h2><p><p>Advancing to higher levels of ritual magic with purpose and power requires an exaltation of consciousness-a spiritual transformation that can serve as an antitode to the seeming banality of modern life.</p> <p>Based on Kabbalistic techniques, the teachings of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and an Hermetic tradition spanning nearly two thousand years, this innovative new work introduces the history of the Golden Dawn and its mythology, the Tree of Life, Deities, demons, rules for practicing magic, and components of effective ritual.</p> <p>A comprehensive course of self-initiation using Israel Regardie's seminal <em>Golden Dawn</em> as a key reference point, <em>Kabbalah, Magic and the Great Work of Self-Transformation</em> guides you through the levels of the Golden Dawn system of ritual magic.

Nordqvist was born in Helsingborg and grew up in Halmstad, Sweden. He originally wanted to be an illustrator but was rejected by several art schools.

While there, Levi reflected on the harsh landscape and its inhabitants, peasants who lived the same lives their ancestors had, constantly fearing black magic and the near presence of death. In so doing, Levi offered a starkly beautiful and moving account of a place and a people living outside the boundaries of progress and time.</p></p><p>A sensitive and gifted writer with a great sense of style.... Perhaps the best thing in his book is the detachment by which he avoids sentimentalizing the peasants and at the same time renders their undestroyed feelings for human values. --Alfred Kazin, <i>New York Herald Tribune Book Review</i><p> The present translation by Frances Frenaye suggests that Levi is a great prose stylist, as well as brilliant observer of human life and a wise and patient diagnostician of our condition. --<i>New Republic</i></p><p> A kind of gray El Greco beauty.... It is a long time since any book has come out of Italy with such an individual accent, such a richness of texture. --Lewis Gannett, <i>New York Herald Tribune</i></p><p> Levi writes with sympathy and insight.... Hailed by Italian critics as one of their most promising contemporary writers, he has proved his competence by making a readable and interesting book out of grim and forbidding material. --<i>Saturday Review of Literature</i></p><p> Has been called in turn a diary, an album of sketches, a novelette, a sociological study and a political essay.

This is the path of conscious love.</p></p><p>PRAISE FOR JOURNEY OF THE HEART <br>This is an extraordinarily good book, because it goes to the heart of the matter of human relationships. In a world in which so many live in crowded solitude, and are afraid of intimacy or have difficulty understanding it, John Welwood's <i>Journey of the Heart</i> comes as a saving grace. I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't greatly benefit from experiencing it, for it is a rare, enriching, and exhilarating experience. (Ashley Montagu, author of Touching). <p><i>Journey of the Heart</i> is a profound and wonderful book. It is a spiritual text on intimate relationship that is grounded in real life, and an inspiration for anyone who believes that a committed relationship can be a process through which two individuals grow." (Jean Shinoda Bolen, author of Goddesses in Everywoman, Gods in Everyman), I am impressed with John Welwood's thinking about critical issues in relationships and his attempt to ground relationship issues in a larger, transpersonal framework. I agree with his view that difficulties provide us with opportunities to grow, to expand our sense of self, and to connect with others in deeper ways. I enjoyed and appreciated that he sees relationships in the larger context of reality and attempts to ground the ordinary in the transcendent realm. What makes this book helpful is that he offers practical processes which can be used to help persons in conflicted relationships... He offers a conceptual and practical pathway from the ordinary experience of everyday conflicts and issues to spiritual evolution. I heartily endorse his efforts. (Harville Hendrix, author of Getting the Love You Want). </p><p>A fabulous book, a deep and profound and caring book, from the Heart, and about the Heart. Required reading for anybody interested in true relationship. Highly recommended! (Ken Wilber, author of A Brief History of Everything). </p><p>John Welwood's <i>Journey of the Heart</i> is a very timely and helpful book that shows how both women and men benefit from relations based on partnership rather than domination. (Riane Eisler, author of The Chalice and the Blade). </p><p>This book teaches one how to take up an inner position from which one can begin to work on one's most intractable feelings in relation to another person-- so that they become a path of self-development for both individuals. (Eugene Gendlin, author of Focusing). </p><p>INSIDE FLAP: <i>Journey of the Heart</i> offers a new approach to intimate relationships-- as a path, an unfolding process of personal and spiritual discovery whose challenges awaken our deepest strengths and resources. </p><p>As men and women find that they can no longer rely on old roles and formulas to get along, intimate relationship calls for a new kind of honesty and awareness, a willingness to let go of old patterns and cultivate new powers and sensitivities. </p><p><i>Journey of the Heart</i> shows how we can meet this challenge by learning to use whatever difficulties we are facing in relationships as opportunities to expand our sense of who we are and deepen our capacity to connect with others. By inviting us to bring together life's basic polarities-- male and female, individuality and commitment, love and fear-- relationships teach us to move gracefully with life's mystery and unpredictability. When we appreciate our relationships in this way-- as teachers-- they become both a personal path that refines and transforms us as individuals and a sacred one as well, allowing us to tap into the larger powers of life. </p><p><i>Journey of the Heart</i> takes a sweeping and penetrating look at the most challenging areas of relationship-- passion, vulnerability, need, commitment, disillusion and heartbreak, conflict and communication, male/female differences, sexuality, and marriage-- to show how the greatest difficulties also provide the greatest opportunities for growth, new awareness, and a deeper connection with ourselves, with others, and with life itself.</p>John Welwood is a clinical psychologist and psychotherapist.

T. Hansen's definitive essay on Evola's political life and theory. <br><br>Men Among the Ruins is Evola's frontal assault on the predominant materialism of our time and the mirage of progress. For Evola and other proponents of Traditionalism, we are now living in an age of increasing strife and chaos: the Kali Yuga of the Hindus or the Germanic Ragnarok. In such a time, social decadence is so widespread that it appears as a natural component of all political institutions. Evola argues that the crises that dominate the daily lives of our societies are part of a secret occult war to remove the support of spiritual and traditional values in order to turn man into a passive instrument of the powerful. <br><br>Evola is often regarded as the godfather of contemporary Italian fascism and right-wing radical politics, but attentive examination of the historical record--as provided by H. T. Hanson's definitive introduction--reveals Evola to be a much more complex figure. Though he held extreme right-wing views, he was a fearless critic of the Fascist regime and preferred a caste system based on spirituality and intellect to the biological racism championed by the Nazis. Ultimately, he viewed the forces of history as comprised by two factions: "history's demolition squad" enslaved by blind faith in the future and those individuals whose watchword is Tradition. These latter stand in this world of ruins at a higher level and are capable of letting go of what needs to be abandoned in order that what is truly essential not be compromised.</p><p>Julius Evola (1898-1974) was one of the leading authorities on the world's esoteric traditions and wrote <i>Revolt Against the Modern World, Introduction to Magic, The Mystery of the Grail, The Hermetic Tradition, The Yoga of Power, Meditations on the Peaks, The Doctrine of Awakening, </i>and<i> Eros and the Mysteries of Love</i>.A controversial philosopher and critic of modern Western civilization, Julius Evola (1898-1974) wrote widely on Eastern religions, alchemy, sexuality, politics, and mythology.

Observing the inspirational leadership of the Pope close up inspired Andreas --Endorsements<br><br></p><p> As the title suggests, <i>The Pope and the CEO</i> is an attempt really well done to articulate an account of the many connections between Christian faith and entrepreneurial-managerial activity. The key to Widmer s argument is the suggestion that the market, the business, the economy can themselves be the place for reciprocity, fraternity, civilization. Under one condition: that the enterprise is not seen only as a machine to make money. As John Paul II taught to the Author, money and profit are weak incentives if we want to move people at the level of their most noble and powerful energies. The narrative of the book is rather original. Between personal recollections of the two years spent as a Swiss guard and the accurate report of the multifarious activities undertaken since he left the Vatican, Widmer provides us with a useful guidebook for people who really desire to achieve successful leadership.</p> <p><i>The Pope and the CEO</i> is a beautifully written book that ought to be read by all those who realize that our time is characterized by a deep crisis, that is not simply economic and financial, but also cultural and ethical.

From my perspective, it is imperative that we rethink and rebuild our approaches to solving the big issues of the day and capturing the many emerging growth opportunities across the globe.

He gave her a scientific education, which was highly unusual for women and girls in the early 19th century. Fascinated with the plant life around her, Anna became a botanist.

We really do feel newly inspired.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br> Everyone covers. To cover is to downplay a disfavored trait so as to blend into the mainstream. Because all of us possess stigmatized attributes, we all encounter pressure to cover in our daily lives.&nbsp;Racial minorities are pressed to &#x201c;act white&#x201d; by changing their names, languages, or cultural practices. Women are told to &#x201c;play like men&#x201d; at work. Gays are asked not to engage in public displays of same-sex affection. The devout are instructed to minimize expressions of faith, and individuals with disabilities are urged to conceal the paraphernalia that permit them to function.&nbsp;Given its pervasiveness, we may experience this pressure to be a simple fact of social life.<br><br> Against conventional understanding, Kenji Yoshino argues that&nbsp;the work of&nbsp;American civil rights law&nbsp;will not be complete until it attends to the harms of coerced conformity.&nbsp;Though we have come to some consensus against penalizing people for differences based on race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, and disability, we still routinely deny equal treatment to people who refuse to downplay differences along these lines.&nbsp;<br><br> At the same time, Yoshino is responsive to the American exasperation with identity politics, which often seems like an endless parade of groups asking for state and social solicitude. He observes that the ubiquity of&nbsp;covering&nbsp;provides an opportunity to lift civil rights into a higher, more universal register. Since we all experience the covering demand, we can all make common cause around a new civil rights paradigm based on our desire for authenticity&#x2014;a desire that brings us together rather than driving us apart.<br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Covering</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Yoshino argues convincingly in this book, part luminous, moving memoir, part cogent, level-headed treatise, that covering is going to become more and more a civil rights issue as the nation (and the nation&#x2019;s courts) struggle with an increasingly multiethnic America.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[A] remarkable debut . . .

So when I turned thirteen, my parents sent me to boarding school. I could see they wished to keep me close, but worried about the effects of tenderness. Small for my age, not so much quiet as silent, I was tarrying at the threshold of adolescence. A singer, I was stricken when my clean boy soprano, that noise only boys can make, broke into a sublunary baritone.<br><br> So off I went, to boarding school and radical reinvention. The need for self-reliance called into being a self on which I could rely. As no one knew me there, no one could challenge the authenticity of this brighter self. Seemingly overnight, I became full of speeches, sociable. I have never worked so hard, or been so happily appetitive, as in those years.<br><br> Yet physically I remained a small dark thing altogether. I remember thinking during a soccer practice that I must have had a lot of natural muscle once, to feel so punished as I watched those boys scissor the air with their blond high school legs. Their bodies hummed to a frequency not my own as balls sailed fluently into nets. I sensed these bodies knew other bodies, as I knew calculus or Shakespeare. That knowledge flaunted itself in the lilt of small hairs off their necks.<br><br> I would not have been able to say I was gay and these others were straight. I knew only I was asked not to be myself, and that to fail to meet that demand was to make myself illegible, my future unimaginable. I hoped time would soften the difference between others and me, but knew it would do the opposite.<br><br> To evade my fate, I acquired a girlfriend. I have a memory of my dormitory&#x2019;s stairwell, where boys would kiss girls good night before curfew. I am standing on the bottom step looking down at her. She is Filipina, a year older, her fluency in French standing for her urbanity. The waver of shadow superimposes an ambivalence on the sweet certainty of her face. I wonder what is more abject than this&#x2014;my brain urging the bloodrush and attention that comes so naturally, so involuntarily, to others.<br><br> Of course, it was not wonderful to be her, either. Yet it was many years before I would speculate about the other side of that kiss. Only after I came out did I listen to the rueful stories of gay men&#x2014;how one picked fights with his wife to avoid sex, how another wished his girlfriend would turn into a pizza at nightfall. The trials of those who love the closeted have yet to be told. I was nowhere near imagining them then.<br><br> My rising anxiety gave me limitless life force in other spheres. I remember a biology lab in which we observed a spear-headed water worm. Like a starfish, it could grow back anything we razored off it, even to the point of generating multiple versions of itself. I saw myself in that gliding shape. Arrow-shaped, it never arrived where it wanted to go. But it knew, when cut, to grow.<br><br> As I moved from high school to college, my mill of activity became more frenetic, a way of keeping the world at bay. At Harvard, I took five or six courses a semester, and as many extracurriculars, foreclosing time for thought, for breath. Friends complained I was walled up, a Jericho waiting for its Joshua. Yet alongside my silence was a ravening urge to speak. So I began to study poetry&#x2014;a childhood passion&#x2014;more formally, finding solace in a language more public than thought but more private than prose. Instead of writing an analytic thesis to graduate as an English major, I petitioned to write a collection of my own poems.<br><br> Writing these poems gave me more pleasure than anything before. That year, the only reason anything had to be, was to be a poem&#x2014;the icicles making their small clear points on the eaves, the broken gate that clacked double knuckled on its hinge, the bitter flesh star at the heart of a lemon. Poetry was my medium, as rigid and formal and obscure as its author. On Saturday nights, I would sit in my cement-block dorm room with my face lit green by my IBM&#x2019;s glow, agonizing not over women, or men, but line breaks. I thought myself happy, and in some sense I was.<br><br> The readers of my collection understood as much of me as I did. One grader took it on faith: &#x201c;I cannot see what you have seen. But I can see that you have seen.&#x201d; The other did not. Impatient, he quoted Marvin Bell&#x2019;s line about how to become a writer is to become &#x201c;less and less embarrassed about more and more.&#x201d;<br><br> Neither grader had license to say the collection was hard to read for a different reason: it was full of pain. The collection ends in crisis&#x2014;the last poem, titled &#x201c;The Infanticide of My Professions,&#x201d; was about the selves we had to kill in young adulthood. The word &#x201c;profession&#x201d; carried its double sense of fa�ade and occupation. The poem expressed the hope I would destroy the selves I only professed to be, and be left with one with a natural vocation. That hope was smothered by the fear I might murder the real self or, worse, that I might find that self to be a tragic one. I still find this poem difficult to read.<br><br> Yet when I wrote it, I acted as if I could carry the world before me. My curricular and extracurricular frenzy had won me a Rhodes scholarship to England. (Perhaps the closeted should not be permitted to compete for these fellowships&#x2014;we have the advantage of those Saturday nights.) But the carbonation in my veins when I won was less joy than relief. I had a new precocity to balance against my backwardness, this social acceptance to weigh against my refusal of life.<br><br> One person saw through me. The poetry professor who had supervised my thesis was a Pre-Raphaelite figure. A whippet-thin chain smoker, she had waist-length auburn hair and eyebrows sharp as circumflex accents. She was the best teacher I have ever had&#x2014;she returned each poem marked up in three colors, one for each pass she had taken over it. She gave me a nickname: Radiating Naivete. &#x201c;Radiating Naivete,&#x201d; she would say when we bumped into each other near midnight at Caff� Paradiso, &#x201c;have you entered the realm of the erotic yet?&#x201d; In a letter she gave me at graduation, she described sitting on a plane next to an emergency exit. There was an arc painted next to the handle, each end of which was marked with a scarlet word: &#x201c;Engage&#x201d; and &#x201c;Disengage.&#x201d; The handle was on &#x201c;Disengage.&#x201d; She said it made her think of me.<br><br> I was not ready when emergency came. Until then, I had been splendidly noncommittal: neither Japanese nor American, neither poet nor pragmatist, neither straight nor gay. But it seemed all ambiguities had to be resolved that year. I had to choose citizenship&#x2014;the red Japanese passport or the blue American one, the two colors of blood. I had to choose a career&#x2014;literature or law. Most of all, I had to choose&#x2014;or choose to acknowledge&#x2014;the sexuality that roiled the surface that summer when I fell bewilderingly in love.<br><br> The Japanese character for erotic desire is the same as that for color. Some say this commonality arises from the Buddhist teaching that desire, like color, distracts us from enlightenment by calling us to the things of this world. The world&#x2019;s colorless wave broke kaleidoscopically over me when I met Brian. We lived together after graduation while we attended summer school&#x2014;he to complete medical school prerequisites, I to prepare for my time in En-gland. Brian was the first in his family to attend college and was, like me, hungry to prove himself. But unlike me, he had directed his intensity outward, devoting his college years to ceaseless public service. This moved me.<br><br> One glittering afternoon, we walked along the Charles River. It was a Sunday&#x2014;the riverside drive was hedged with sawhorses, closed to cars. The cyclists sheared the air. Dazzled by the needles of light stitching the water, I turned to watch him watch them. I noticed his eyelashes were reflected in his eyes, like awnings in windowpanes. As I tried to make sense of that reflection, I found I could not look away. His irises were brown, clouding into orange, with brighter flecks around his pupils. Then it became as important not to look as to look, as I feared I would be lost in a rush of bronze motes.<br><br> It hardly mattered that I knew he was straight. I experienced my desire for him, which was a pent-up desire for many men, as having an absolute absolved necessity. Just as the brain seems larger than the skull that contains it, so did my desire seem grossly to exceed the contours of my body. I thought if I could only make him experience the strength of what I felt, he could not demur.<br><br> I had, in one sense, chosen the right man. Brian responded with compassion. Yet my desire was now not only thwarted, but exposed. Brian made me acknowledge my knowledge; he made me own myself. I snapped back into my skin. And I felt something in me crack&#x2014;like a safe, a whip.</p><h2>Data Structures and Algorithms in Java</h2><p><p> <i>Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, Second Edition</i> is designed to be easy to read and understand although the topic itself is complicated.

Thirty-Seven Practices of a Bodhisattva is one of the most revered and loved texts in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. While this text has been translated many times, Ken McLeod&#39;s plain and simple English beautifully reflects the simplicity and directness of the original Tibetan. McLeod&#39;s commentary is full of striking images, provocative questions and inspiring descriptions of what it means to be awake and present in your life. Practical instruction, brief and to the point, is found in each of the verse commentaries, providing straightforward responses to the question, &#34;How do I practice this?&#34; McLeod is clearly writing from his own experience.

It was written not on paper or a computer, but thumbed on a phone and smuggled out of Manus Island in the form of thousands of text messages.</p><p>We should recognise the extent of Behrouz Boochani&#x2019;s achievement by first acknowledging the difficulty of its creation, the near impossibility of its existence. Everything has been done by our government to dehumanise asylum seekers. Their names and their stories are kept from us. On Nauru and Manus Island, they live in a zoo of cruelty. Their lives are stripped of meaning.</p><p>These prisoners were all people who had been imprisoned without charge, without conviction, and without sentence. It is a particularly Kafkaesque fate that frequently has the cruellest effect &#x2015; and one fully intended by their Australian jailers &#x2013; of destroying hope.</p><p>Thus the cry for freedom was transmuted into charring flesh as 23-year-old Omid Masoumali burnt his body in protest. The screams of 21-year-old Hodan Yasin as she too set herself alight.</p><p>This is what we, Australia, have become.</p><p>The ignored begging of a woman on Nauru being raped.</p><p>A girl who sewed her lips together.</p><p>A child refugee who stitched a heart into their hand and didn&#x2019;t know why.</p><p>Behrouz Boochani&#x2019;s revolt took a different form. For the one thing that his jailers could not destroy in Behrouz Boochani was his belief in words: their beauty, their necessity, their possibility, their liberating power.</p><p>And so over the course of his imprisonment Behrouz Boochani began one of the more remarkable careers in Australian journalism: reporting about what was happening on Manus Island in the form of tweets, texts, phone videos, calls, and emails. In so doing he defied the Australian government which went to extreme lengths to prevent refugees&#x2019; stories being told, constantly seeking to deny journalists access to Manus Island and Nauru; going so far, for a time, as to legislate the draconian section 42 of the <em>Australian Border Force Act</em>, which allowed for the jailing for two years of any doctors or social workers who bore public witness to children beaten or sexually abused, to acts of rape or cruelty.</p><p>His words came to be read around the world, to be heard across the oceans and over the shrill cries of the legions of paid propagandists. With only the truth on his side and a phone in his hand, one imprisoned refugee alerted the world to Australia&#x2019;s great crime.</p><p>Behrouz Boochani has now written a strange and terrible book chronicling his fate as a young man who has spent <em>five years</em> on Manus Island as a prisoner of the Australian government&#x2019;s refugee policies &#x2015; policies in which both our major parties have publicly competed in cruelty.</p><p>Reading this book is difficult for any Australian. We pride ourselves on decency, kindness, generosity, and a fair go. None of these qualities are evident in Boochani&#x2019;s account of hunger, squalor, beatings, suicide and murder.</p><p>I was painfully reminded in his descriptions of the Australian officials&#x2019; behaviour on Manus of my father&#x2019;s descriptions of the Japanese commanders&#x2019; behaviour in the POW camps where he and fellow Australian POWs suffered so much.</p><p>What has become of us when it is we who now commit such crimes?</p><p>This account demands a reckoning. Someone must answer for these crimes. Because if they don&#x2019;t, the one certainty that history teaches us is that the injustice of Manus Island and Nauru will one day be repeated on a larger, grander, and infinitely more tragic scale in Australia.</p><p>Someone is responsible, and it is they, and not the innocent, to whose great suffering this book bears such disturbing witness, who should be in jail.</p><p>This book, though, is something greater than just a <em>J&#x2019;accuse</em>. It is a profound victory for a young poet who showed us all how much words can still matter. Australia imprisoned his body, but his soul remained that of a free man. His words have now irrevocably become our words, and our history must henceforth account for his story.</p><p>I hope one day to welcome Behrouz Boochani to Australia as what I believe he has shown himself to be in these pages. A writer. A great Australian writer.</p> <p> Richard Flanagan, 2018</p><strong>*<br><br>Excerpt from Chapter 5&#x2015;<br>A Christmas (Island) Tale / A Stateless Rohingya Boy Sent Away to Follow the Star of Exile</strong><br><p>They load us onto a bus. A few days ago in this exact area a bloody battle erupted, right in the place where we are now standing like submissive sheep. Lebanese refugees stood up to defy the guards who wanted to load them on board. But the guards smashed them and beat them down. They annihilated them, beat down on the arms and faces of a few of them. The guards dragged their battered and blood-soaked bodies over the concrete. They banished them to Manus Island. No matter how the refugees tried to resist, they couldn&#x2019;t alter the political machinations of a government, a government that had just recently taken power, that had gone mad with the mere whiff of power.</p><p>The bus takes off. The path to the airport is surrounded by jungle. The conversation inside the vehicle is about the possibility of a particular scenario: that we will disembark at Darwin Airport and find out that all this talk is nothing but a ridiculous performance, the whole thing just a farce, that this whole thing doesn&#x2019;t involve Manus in any way. However, talk of this kind comes from a place of weakness. At this point, faith in an occurrence that resembles a miracle comes across as ludicrous. We have to accept the reality. Within hours we will be descending on a remote island called Manus.</p><p>A few police vehicles follow our bus, and a few travel ahead. It is as though they are attending to our bus like a car transporting a president. We are so disempowered that we couldn&#x2019;t do anything at all, even if we wanted to. Our baggy, cumbersome clothing weighs us down.</p><p>Pandemonium breaks loose at the airport. Dozens of police officers stand by the plane in military mode. A few journalists have their cameras ready. All of them are waiting for us. The interpreters are there, also. That Kurdish woman has both her hands clasped behind her back. She just stands there, completely obedient. I can&#x2019;t work it out; I can&#x2019;t understand why they have to securitise that space. I am frightened by the journalists; I am frightened by the cameras they hold.</p><p>Journalists inquire into everything. They are always seeking out horrific events. They acquire fodder for their work from wars, from bad occurrences, from the misery of people. I remember when I used to work for a newspaper I would become agitated from listening to all the news about, for instance, a coup d&#x2019;�tat, a revolution, or a terrorist attack. I would begin work with great fervour and scramble for that kind of research like a vulture; in turn, I fed the appetite of the people.</p><p>The journalists are staking out the situation like vultures: waiting until the wretched and miserable exit the vehicle; eager for us to come out as quickly as possible, to catch sight of the poor and helpless and launch on us &#x2015;</p><p><em>Click, click /<br>Waiting to take their photos / Click, click.</em></p><p>&#x2015; and dispatch the images to the whole world. They are completely mesmerised by the government&#x2019;s dirty politics and just follow along. The deal is that we have to be a warning, a lesson for people who want to seek protection in Australia.</p></p><h2>The Duke&#39;s Stolen Bride: The Rogue Files</h2><p><p><strong>From <em>USA Today</em> bestselling author&nbsp;Sophie Jordan comes a scandalously sensual romance&nbsp;in her&nbsp;beloved&nbsp;Rogue Files series.</strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;Deliciously sexy!&#x201d;&#x2014;</strong><strong>Sarah MacLean, </strong><strong><em>New York Times </em>bestselling author&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong><em>An urgent dilemma... </em></strong></p><p>To save her impoverished family, Marian Langley will become a mistress.

By the author of <i>On Human Nature. </i>Reprint. 75,000 first printing. <i>NYT. </i></p><p>Humans, the Harvard University entomologist Edward O. Wilson has observed, have an innate--or at least extremely ancient--connection to the natural world, and our continued divorce from it has led to the loss of not only "a vast intellectual legacy born of intimacy" with nature, but also our very sanity. In <i>The Diversity of Life</i>, Wilson takes a sweeping view of our planet's natural richness, remarking on what on the surface seems a paradox: "almost all the species that ever lived are extinct, and yet more are alive today than at any time in the past." (Wilson's elegant explanation is a scientific education in itself.) This great variety of species is, of course, threatened by habitat destruction, global climate change, and a host of other forces, and Wilson revisits his oft-stated call for the protection of wilderness and undeveloped land, noting that "wilderness has virtue unto itself and needs no extraneous justification." We should, he continues, regard every species, "every scrap of biodiversity," as precious and irreplaceable, without attempting to quantify that regard with utilitarian measures such as "bio-economics." In short, Wilson offers with this book a simple, workable environmental ethic that extends the work of Aldo Leopold and other conservationists. A remarkably productive and influential scientist, Wilson is also a fine writer, and his survey of biodiversity makes for welcome and instructive reading. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>Edward O. Wilson is widely recognized as one of the world&#39;s preeminent biologists and naturalists. The author of more than twenty books, including The Creation, The Social Conquest of Earth, The Meaning of Human Existence, and Letters to a Young Scientist, Wilson is a professor emeritus at Harvard University. The winner of two Pulitzer Prizes, he lives in Lexington, Massachusetts.</p><h2>Gesenius&#39; Hebrew and Chaldee Lexicon to the Old Testament Scriptures: Numerically Coded to Strong&#39;s Exhaustive Concordance, with an English Index of More Than 12,000 Entries</h2><p>With Hebrew, as with many other languages, mastery of the alphabet is the first and highest hurdle to jump for one who desires some working knowledge of the language.

"When my mother died,&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew no woman my age who had experienced mother&nbsp;&nbsp;loss. I felt utterly and irrevocably alone. In&nbsp;&nbsp;college, where new friends knew only as much about&nbsp;&nbsp;me as I was willing to reveal, I told few people&nbsp;&nbsp;my mother had died. I searched the university&nbsp;&nbsp;library and local bookstoresfor writings about&nbsp;&nbsp;mother loss. In each book I found about&nbsp;&nbsp;mother-daughter relationships, I quickly flipped ahead to the&nbsp;&nbsp;chapter about a mother's death, but discovered&nbsp;&nbsp;they all assumed the reader would be in her forties&nbsp;&nbsp;or fifties when her mother dies. I was eighteen."&nbsp;&nbsp;--excerpt from <i>Motherless</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Daughters.<br><br>Not only for motherless&nbsp;&nbsp;daughters, but for all women who want to better&nbsp;&nbsp;understand the mother/daughter relationship, this&nbsp;&nbsp;beautifully written work inspired an Anna&nbsp;&nbsp;Quindlen column; appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>, Ingram,&nbsp;&nbsp;Barnes &amp; Noble, and San Francisco best-seller&nbsp;&nbsp;lists; and received an extraordinary amount of&nbsp;&nbsp;media attention including a feature on The Today&nbsp;&nbsp;Show. Hope Edelman lost her mother to breast cancer&nbsp;&nbsp;when she was eighteen. Unable to find a book to&nbsp;&nbsp;help her understand and cope with that loss, she&nbsp;&nbsp;decided to write her own. She posted notices&nbsp;&nbsp;asking motherless women to share their experiences&nbsp;&nbsp;with her, and was unprepared for both the number of&nbsp;&nbsp;responses she received, and for their emotional&nbsp;&nbsp;intensity. Eventually meeting with 92 women and&nbsp;&nbsp;surveying 154 by mail, Hope was able to compare how&nbsp;&nbsp;mother loss affects daughters differently&nbsp;&nbsp;depending on their ages, their relationships to their&nbsp;&nbsp;mothers, their father's attitude, and the support&nbsp;&nbsp;or dependency of siblings. But more important&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope's book explores what these women share -- a void&nbsp;&nbsp;in their lives they cannot seem to fill. Their&nbsp;&nbsp;common experiences and insights will help&nbsp;&nbsp;motherless daughters, and those who care about them, come&nbsp;&nbsp;to better understand how this painful loss shapes&nbsp;&nbsp;lives forever.</p><p>Edelman shares her own painful story and the stories of many other women who, as children or adults, lost their mothers. She explains the stages of grief and adjustment. She considers the secondary effects that can occur: the girl-child filling the lost mother&#39;s role at home for father and younger siblings.

It wasn&#x2019;t likely I&#x2019;d forget to pack for college, but everything needed to go on the list so it could be checked off. </p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re so hot.&#x201d; Liam&#x2019;s fish lips tickled my neck in short, slow pecks. It once made me giggle, but now it kind of made me want to bite him. </p><p><i>And a pharmacy run,</i> I remembered. I wanted to stock up on my pill so I wouldn&#x2019;t have to worry about it for a while. <i>Packing and the pharmacy. Packing and the pharmacy. Packing and the pharmacy. Don&#x2019;t forget, K.C. </i></p><p>Liam thrust his hips between my legs, and I rolled my eyes. </p><p>We were still clothed, but I wasn&#x2019;t sure he realized that. </p><p>If I weren&#x2019;t so tired, I&#x2019;d laugh. He rarely got drunk after all&#x2014;tonight only because it was an end-of-summer bash. And although I&#x2019;d never been overwhelmed with a desire for sex, I did love that he tried to jump my bones at every opportunity. It made me feel wanted. </p><p>But it just wasn&#x2019;t happening tonight. </p><p>&#x201c;Liam,&#x201d; I grunted, twisting up my lips as I pushed his hand off my breast, &#x201c;I think we&#x2019;re done for the night, okay? Let&#x2019;s lock up the car and walk to your house.&#x201d;</p><p>We&#x2019;d been in his car for over a half hour&#x2014;me trying to indulge his fantasy of sex in risky places and him trying to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Hell, I didn&#x2019;t even know what he was trying to do. </p><p>I felt guilty for not being more into it lately. I felt guilty for not helping him get into it tonight. And I felt guilty for making mental additions to my to-do list while he was trying&#x2014;keyword, <i>trying</i>&#x2014;to get it on with me. </p><p>We hadn&#x2019;t made love in a long time, and I didn&#x2019;t know what my problem was anymore. </p><p>His head sank into my shoulder, and I felt the weight of his hundred and eighty pounds collapse on my body. </p><p>He didn&#x2019;t move, and I let out a sigh, relaxing into the passenger seat of his Camaro, my muscles burning from trying to support his body weight all this time. </p><p>He&#x2019;d given up. <i>Thank God. </i></p><p>But then I groaned, registering that his body had gone a little too still, except for the slow, soft rhythm of his breathing. </p><p><i>Great. </i>Now he was passed out. </p><p>&#x201c;Liam,&#x201d; I whispered, not sure why, since we were completely alone in his car on a dark, quiet street outside my friend Tate Brandt&#x2019;s house. </p><p>Arching my head up, I spoke into his ear that was nearly covered by his blond hair. &#x201c;Liam, wake up!&#x201d; I wheezed, since his weight was hindering my oxygen intake. </p><p>He moaned but didn&#x2019;t budge. </p><p>I slammed my head back onto the headrest and ground my teeth together. What the hell was I going to do now? </p><p>We&#x2019;d gone to the Loop tonight for the last race before college started next week and then Tate and her boyfriend, Jared Trent, had thrown a party at his house, which just happened to be right outside, next door to her place. I&#x2019;d told my mom that I&#x2019;d be sleeping over at her house when I was really planning on spending the night with my boyfriend. </p><p>Who was now passed out. </p><p>Tate&#x2019;s house was locked, I didn&#x2019;t know how to drive Liam&#x2019;s car, and the last thing I was ever going to do was call my mother for a ride. </p><p>Reaching for the handle, I swung the car door open and pulled my right leg from under Liam. I pushed against his chest, raising him off me only as much as I needed to squirm out from underneath his body and stumble out of the car. He groaned but didn&#x2019;t open his eyes, and I wondered if I should be worried about how much he&#x2019;d had to drink. </p><p>Leaning in, I watched his chest rise and fall in quiet, steady movements. I grabbed the keys he&#x2019;d dropped on the floor and my wrist purse with my cell phone and slammed the door shut, locking the car. </p><p>Liam didn&#x2019;t live too far, and even though I knew it was a lot to ask, I was going to have to wake up Tate. If Jared was even letting her get any sleep at all. </p><p>I ran my hands down my strapless white summer dress and powered quietly down the sidewalk in my rhinestone sandals. Pretty dressed up for the race track earlier, but I wanted to look nice at the party. It was the last time I was going to see some of these people. For a while, anyway. </p><p>Squeezing my little purse&#x2014;small enough for my phone and some money&#x2014;in my hand, I traipsed up the small incline into Jared&#x2019;s yard and up the front steps of his house. No light shone from inside, but I knew there had to be some people still here, since the street was littered with a few unfamiliar cars and I heard the low beat of music still pouring out. Lyrics saying something about &#x201c;down with the sickness.&#x201d; </p><p>I turned the knob, stepped into the house, and peered around the corner into the living room. </p><p>And stopped. Dead. <i>What the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?</i></p><p>The room was dark, not a single light showing other than the blue glow from the screen on the stereo. </p><p>Maybe there were other lights on in the house. Maybe there were other people still here. I couldn&#x2019;t say. </p><p>All I could do was fucking stand there as my eyes stung, and a lump stretched my throat, at the sight of Jaxon Trent damn near naked on top of another girl. </p><p>I instantly looked away, closing my eyes. </p><p><i>Jax. </i>I shook my head. <i>No. </i>I didn&#x2019;t care about this<i>. </i>Why was my heart beating so fast? </p><p>Jaxon Trent was Tate&#x2019;s boyfriend&#x2019;s little brother. Nothing more. Just a kid. </p><p>A kid who watched me. A kid I rarely ever talked to. A kid who felt like a threat just standing next to me. </p><p>A kid who was looking less and less like one every day. </p><p>And right now he wasn&#x2019;t coming up for air. I jerked my body toward the door, not wanting him&#x2014;or her&#x2014;to see me, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </p><p>&#x201c;Jax,&#x201d; the girl gasped. &#x201c;More. Please.&#x201d;</p><p>And I stopped, unable to move again. <i>Just leave, K.C. You don&#x2019;t care. </i></p><p>I squeezed the doorknob, sucking in quick breaths, but I didn&#x2019;t move. Couldn&#x2019;t move. </p><p>I didn&#x2019;t know why my hands shook. </p><p>Chewing my bottom lip, I inched around the corner again and saw him and the girl. </p><p>My heart pounded like a jackhammer in my chest. And it hurt. </p><p>The girl&#x2014;I didn&#x2019;t recognize her from school&#x2014;was completely naked, lying on her stomach on the couch. Jax was sprawled on top of her from behind, and judging from his jeans pushed down below his ass and his thrusting hips, he was inside her. </p><p>He didn&#x2019;t even get fully undressed to make love to a girl. He couldn&#x2019;t even look her in the face. I wasn&#x2019;t surprised. With the arrogance he displayed around school, Jax could do whatever he wanted, and he did. </p><p>Holding himself up with one arm, he used the other to wrap around her face and twist her chin toward him before he leaned down and covered her mouth with his. </p><p>Liam had never kissed me like that. Or I&#x2019;d never kissed him like that. </p><p>The girl&#x2014;long blond hair fanning around her face and spilling over her shoulders&#x2014;kissed him back with full force, their jaws moving in sync as his tongue and teeth worked her. </p><p>Jax&#x2019;s smooth, sculpted hips ground into her in slow, savory movements while his hand left her face to run down her back and then slide underneath her body to cup her breast. He didn&#x2019;t do one thing at a time. Every part of his body was in this, and everything he did looked as if it felt good. </p><p>And why wouldn&#x2019;t it? Jax was coveted by the girls in this town for a reason after all. He was suave, confident, and good-looking. Not my type, but there was no denying that he was sexy. According to Tate, he was part Native American.</p><p>His skin was like toffee&#x2014;smooth, unblemished, and warm-looking. His hair was a deep brown, almost black, and it hung halfway down his back. He often braided pieces of it before tying it back into a ponytail midskull, which he did <i>all</i> the time. I&#x2019;d never seen his hair hanging loose. </p><p>He had to be six feet tall by now and would probably be exceeding his brother in height in no time. I&#x2019;d seen Jax on the lacrosse field at school and at the gym where we both worked out. The dips in his biceps and triceps flexed as he held himself above the girl and worked his body into hers. With the moonlight coming through the window, I could just make out the V in his torso as it descended to his abs and lower. </p><p>He didn&#x2019;t break pace as he whispered in her ear, and as if she were given an order, she dropped her foot to the floor, bent her knee, and arched her back. </p><p>Jax let his head fall back and bared his teeth as he sank deeper into her, and I stared, absently tracing the scar on the inside of my wrist. </p><p>I wanted it to be like that for me. I wanted to be breathless like her. Gasping and desperate. Passionate and hungry. </p><p>Liam had made me happy once, and when he messed up, I took him back, because I thought the relationship was worth it. </p><p>But now, seeing this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I knew we were missing something. </p><p>I didn&#x2019;t know when the tear spilled over, but I felt it drop onto my dress, and I blinked rapidly, wiping my face. </p><p>And then my eye caught something, and I blinked again, noticing someone else in the room. Another girl, nearly naked in her bra and panties. </p><p>I swallowed a gasp, sucked in air, and then swallowed again. </p><p><i>What the hell? </i></p><p>She walked across the room&#x2014;she must&#x2019;ve been over by the windows, because I hadn&#x2019;t seen her until now&#x2014;and leaned down, kissing Jax hard. </p><p>Acid bile crept up my throat. </p><p>&#x201c;Ugh!&#x201d; I growled, and stumbled backward, hitting the opposite wall in the entryway. Scrambling, I yanked open the front door and flew outside without looking back. </p><p>Jumping the steps, I had hit the grass running when a deep voice commanded behind me, &#x201c;Stop!&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t. </p><p>Screw him. Screw Jaxon Trent. I didn&#x2019;t know why I was mad, and who the hell cared? </p><p>Running across the lawn, I bolted for the sidewalk, wishing I&#x2019;d worn sneakers instead of sandals that flopped around on my feet. </p><p>&#x201c;Stop, or I will take you to the ground, K.C.!&#x201d; Jax&#x2019;s loud bellow threatened behind me, and I brought myself to a sudden halt. </p><p><i>Shit. </i>My eyes darted from left to right, searching for an escape. He wouldn&#x2019;t really do that, would he? </p><p>I inched around slowly, watching as he stepped off the stairs and walked toward me. He was wearing pants, thank God. But I guess that was easy, since he never really took them off. The dark-washed jeans hung off his hips, and I got a damn clear look at the muscles framing his abs. He had a swimmer&#x2019;s body, but I wasn&#x2019;t sure if he was actually a swimmer. From the way the top of his jeans barely hung just above his hairline, I guessed he wasn&#x2019;t wearing boxers&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or anything under the jeans. I thought of what was just beneath his pants, and heat warmed my belly. I clenched my thighs together. </p><p>I shot my eyes down to the ground, wondering how I could stand the sight of him. He was just a kid. Did he do things like that with a lot of girls? </p><p>He came up to stand in front of me, hovering down, since he was nearly a half foot taller. &#x201c;What are you doing here?&#x201d; he accused. </p><p>I locked my mouth shut and scowled at the air around him, still avoiding eye contact. </p><p>&#x201c;You left with your dipshit boyfriend an hour ago,&#x201d; he pointed out. </p><p>I kept my hot eyes averted. </p><p>&#x201c;K.C.!&#x201d; He shoved his hand in my face, snapping his fingers a few times. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s process what you just saw in there. You entered my house uninvited in the middle of the night and witnessed me having sex with a girl in the privacy of my own home. Now let&#x2019;s move on. Why are you roaming around in the dark alone?&#x201d;</p><p>I finally looked up and sneered. I always had to do that to cover up the way my face felt on fire at the sight of his blue eyes. For someone so dark and wild, his eyes were completely out of place but never seemed wrong. They were the color of a tropical sea. The color of the sky right before storm clouds rolled in. Tate called them azure. I called them hell. </p><p>Crossing my arms over my chest, I took a deep breath. &#x201c;Liam&#x2019;s too drunk to drive, all right?&#x201d; I bit out. &#x201c;He passed out in the car.&#x201d;</p><p>He looked down the street to where Liam&#x2019;s car sat and narrowed his eyes before scowling back down at me. &#x201c;So why can&#x2019;t you drive him home?&#x201d; he asked. </p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t drive a clutch.&#x201d;</p><p>He closed his eyes and shook his head. Running his hand through his hair, he stopped and fisted it midstroke. &#x201c;Your boyfriend is a fucking idiot,&#x201d; he snarled, and then dropped his hand, looking exasperated. </p><p>I sighed, not wanting to get into it. He and Liam never got along, and while I didn&#x2019;t know why, I did know it was mostly Jax&#x2019;s fault. </p><p>I&#x2019;d known him for almost a year, and even though I knew small details&#x2014;he was into computers, his real parents weren&#x2019;t around, and he thought of his brother&#x2019;s mother as his own&#x2014;he was still a mystery to me. All I knew was that he looked at me sometimes, and lately, it was with disdain. As if he was disappointed. </p><p>I tipped my chin up and kept my tone flat. &#x201c;I knew Tate was staying with Jared tonight, and I didn&#x2019;t want to wake up her dad to let me in the house to crash. I need her to help me get Liam home and to let me in her house. Is she up?&#x201d; I asked. </p><p>He shook his head, and I wasn&#x2019;t sure if that meant &#x201c;no&#x201d; or &#x201c;you&#x2019;ve got to be kidding me.&#x201d;</p><p>Digging in his jeans pocket, he pulled out keys. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll drive you home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I rushed. &#x201c;My mom thinks I&#x2019;m staying at Tate&#x2019;s tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>His eyes narrowed on me, and I felt judged. Yeah, I was lying to my mother to spend the night with my boyfriend. And, yes, I was eighteen years old and still not allowed the freedom of an adult. <i>Stop looking at me like that. </i></p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t move,&#x201d; he ordered, and then turned around, walking back to his house. </p><p>After less than a minute he walked back out and started across the lawn to Tate&#x2019;s, jerking his chin at me to follow. I assumed he had a key, so I jogged up to his side as he climbed the porch steps. </p><p>&#x201c;What about Liam?&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t leave my boyfriend sleeping in his car all night. What if something happened to him? Or he got sick? And Tate&#x2019;s dad would have a fit if I tried to bring him inside. </p><p>He unlocked the front door&#x2014;I wasn&#x2019;t sure if he had Tate&#x2019;s or Jared&#x2019;s keys&#x2014;and stepped inside the darkened foyer. Turning to me, he waved his hand in a big show, inviting me in. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get Jared to follow me in his car while I drive Dick-wad home in his, okay?&#x201d; He hooded his eyes, looking bored. </p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t hurt him,&#x201d; I warned, crossing the threshold and walking past him. </p><p>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t, but he deserves it.&#x201d;</p><p>I swung back around to face him, arching an eyebrow. &#x201c;Oh, you think you&#x2019;re so much better, Jax?&#x201d; I smiled. &#x201c;Do you even know those skanks&#x2019; names in there?&#x201d;</p><p>His mouth instantly tightened. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not skanks, K.C. They&#x2019;re friends. And I&#x2019;d mak...</p></p><h2>Fortunately, the Milk ...</h2><p>Fortunately the Milk</p><p><p>"I bought the milk," said my father.</p><p>"I walked out of the corner shop, and heard a noise like this: T h u m m t h u m m.</p><p>I looked up and saw a huge silver disc hovering in the air above Marshall Road."</p><p>"<em>Hullo</em>," I said to myself.

She had no idea where she was or how she'd gotten lost. After all, she'd lived in Colville her entire life. She should know&#x2014;<i>did</i> know&#x2014; every square inch of this town. But the last thing she remembered was going out to collect the mail and that must have been hours ago.<p> </p><p>The street didn't look familiar and the houses weren't any she recognized. The Henderson house at the corner of Chestnut and Elm had been her marker, but it was nowhere in sight. She remembered that the Hendersons had painted their place white with green shutters. Where was it? she wondered, starting to feel frantic. <i>Where was it? </i>George would be upset with her for taking so long. Oh no, how could she have forgotten? George was dead.</p><p> </p><p>The weight of grief settled over her, heavy and oppressive. George, her beloved husband, was gone&#x2014;taken from her just two months short of their sixtieth anniversary. It had all happened so fast!.</p><p> </p><p>Last November, her husband had gone outside to warm up the car before church, and a few minutes later he lay dead in the carport. He'd had a massive heart attack. The nice young man who'd come with the ambulance had told her George was dead before he even hit the pavement. He sounded as if this was supposed to comfort her. But nothing could have eased the shock, the <i>horror,</i> of that dreadful morning.</p><p> </p><p>Vivian blinked hard, and despite the May warmth of eastern Washington, a chill raced up her bare arms. She tried to extinguish her growing panic. How was she going to find her way home?</p><p> </p><p>Susannah would know what to do&#x2014;but then she remembered that her daughter didn't live in Colville anymore. <i>Of course</i> Susannah wasn't at home. She had her own house. In Seattle, wasn't it? Yes, in Seattle. She was married with two precious children. Susannah and Joe's children. Good grief, why couldn't she think of their names? Her grandchildren were her joy and her pride. She could picture their faces as clearly as if she was looking at a photograph, but she couldn't recall their names.</p><p> </p><p><i>Chrissie.</i> The relief was instantaneous. Her granddaughter's name was Chrissie. She was born first and then Brian was born three years later. Or was it four years? It didn't matter, Vivian decided. She had their names now.</p><p> </p><p>What she needed to do was concentrate on where she was&#x2014;and where she should go from here. It was already starting to get dark and she didn't want to wander aimlessly from street to street. But she couldn't figure out what to do next. could've stopped and asked for directions to Woods Road.</p><p> </p><p>No!Woods Road had been her childhood address. She hadn't lived there since she was a schoolgirl, and that was before the war. For heaven's sake, she should be able to remember her own address! What was wrong with her?</p><p> </p><p>The place she was looking for was the house she and George had bought almost forty-five years ago, when the children were still at home. She felt a mixture of fear!and shame. A woman of eighty should know where she lived. George would be so frustrated and impatient if he ever found out about this!. Only he'd never know. That didn't make her feel any better, though. She <i>needed</i> him, and he wasn't there to help her, and that filled her with anxiety so intense, she wrung her hands.</p><p> </p><p>Vivian started walking again, although she wasn't sure where she was headed. Maybe if she kept moving, if she concentrated hard enough, the memory would eventually return to her.</p><p> </p><p>Her legs tired quickly, and she sighed with relief when she saw a bench by the side of the road. Vivian couldn't understand why the city would place a nice wooden bench there&#x2014;not even near a bus stop. It was a waste of taxpayers' money. If George knew about this, he'd be fuming. He'd been a public servant all those years, a superior court judge. A fine one, too, a man of principle and character. How proud Vivian was of him.</p><p> </p><p>Still, she was so grateful for somewhere to sit, she wasn't about to complain. George had freely voiced his opinions about matters of civic responsibility and what he called city hall's squandering of resources. While she listened to her husband's views, she didn't always share them. She had her own thoughts when it came to politics and things like that, but she usually didn't discuss them with George. That was something she'd learned early in her marriage. George always wanted to convince everyone of the superiority of <i>his</i> ideas and he'd argue until he wore people down. So when her views differed from his, she kept them to herself.</p><p> </p><p>Sitting on the hard bench, she glanced about, hoping to find a landmark. Oh my, this was a busy street. Cars whizzed past, their lights blinding her until she felt dizzy. She wasn't nearly as tired now that she was sitting. That was good, because she needed to think. Thinking was important. She hated forgetting basic facts, like her address, her phone number, people's names. This happened more and more often now that George had died, and it frightened her.</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps if she closed her eyes for a moment, that would help. She'd try to relax, clear her mind, since all this worry only made her memory less reliable.</p><p> </p><p>It was chilly now that the sun had gone down. She should've brought a sweater but she'd been working in the garden earlier and it had been hot. Her irises were lovely this spring, even though her garden was in sad shape. For years, it had been a source of pride and she hated the way it looked these days. She did as much as she could, but so much else needed to be done. Weeding, pruning, planting annuals! After dinner she'd decided to do some watering and remembered that she hadn't collected the mail. That was when she'd gone out, planning to walk to the neighborhood mailbox. And now here she was, lost and confused and afraid.</p><p> </p><p>That was when Vivian sensed someone's presence and opened her eyes. Joy coursed through her veins as she stared, wondering if her mind had betrayed her. "George?"</p><p> </p><p>Her husband of fifty-nine years stood beside her, shadowed under the nearby streetlight. His smile warmed her and she straightened, eyes wide open, terrified he'd disappear. George had come to help her, come to save her.</p><p> </p><p>"That <i>is</i> you, isn't it?"</p><p> </p><p>He didn't answer but stood there plain as could be. He'd always been such a handsome man, she thought, admiring his broad shoulders and his confident posture.</p><p> </p><p>They'd been high school sweethearts and known each other their entire lives. Vivian felt she was the luckiest girl in the world when George Leary asked her to marry him. They'd been apart for nearly three years while he was fighting in Europe. Then he'd gone to college to get his law degree on the G.I. Bill. That time of struggle had paid off, though, and after a few years of private practice, he'd been invited to join the bench. George had been the one and only love of her life and she missed him terribly. How like him to come to her now, in her hour of need.</p><p> </p><p>Vivian reached out to him, but George backed away. She dropped her hand abruptly, biting her lower lip. No, of course&#x2014;she should've realized she couldn't touch him. One couldn't touch the dead.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm lost," she whispered. "Don't be angry with me, but I can't find my way home."</p><p> </p><p>He smiled again and she was so relieved he wasn't upset with her. She'd forgotten things before he died, too, and sometimes he got frustrated, although he tried to hide it. She'd even stopped cooking but that was because she'd forgotten so many of her recipes. The ones in cookbooks were too hard to read, too confusing. But George never complained and often heated soup for both of them.</p><p> </p><p>Vivian felt she should explain what had happened. "I went to get the mail and I must've decided to go for a walk, because when I looked up I wasn't anywhere close to the house."</p><p> </p><p>He stretched out his hand and she got to her feet. "Can you take me home?" she asked, hating how plaintive and helpless she sounded.</p><p> </p><p>He didn't answer. Then she realized that dead men couldn't talk, either. That was all right; she didn't care as long as George stayed with her. Six months it had been since he'd died and every one of those months had seemed an eternity.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm so glad you came," she whispered, trying to hide the way her voice cracked with emotion. "Oh, George, I miss you." She told him about the garden, even though she knew she was rambling. He'd never liked it when she talked too much, but she was afraid he'd have to leave soon, and there was so much to tell him. "George, I'm sure Martha is stealing. I just don't know what to do. I watch her like a hawk when she comes to clean, but still I find things missing. I can't let her rob me blind, and yet I hate to fire her after all these years. What should I do?" She hadn't really expected him to answer, and he didn't.</p><p> </p><p>Then, suddenly, she saw the house. They were on Chestnut Avenue, where they'd lived since 1961. She walked laboriously to the front door, holding on to the railing and taking the steps one at a time. When she looked up to thank George for helping her, her beloved husband had vanished.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, George," she sobbed. "Come back to me!please. Please come back."</p></p><h2>Profit First A Simple System to Transform Your Business from a Cash-Eating Monster to a Money-Making Machine</h2><p>You are about to discover the profoundly simple yet shockingly effective accounting plug-in that will transform your business from a cash eating monster into a money making machine.

Father Fox and his russet-furred, pointy-nosed family romp through the pages of these original American nursery rhymes, written and illustrated in the early 1970s by a pair of Vermonter sisters, Clyde and Wendy Watson.

By that time, she had put her deep disappointment in her marriage behind her and developed an independent life&#x2014;now threatened by the public role she would be forced to play. A lifeline came to her in the form of a feisty campaign reporter for the Associated Press: Lorena Hickok. Over the next thirty years, until Eleanor&#x2019;s death, the two women carried on an extraordinary relationship: They were, at different points, lovers, confidantes, professional advisors, and caring friends.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> They couldn't have been more different. Eleanor had been raised in one of the nation&#x2019;s most powerful political families and was introduced to society as a debutante before marrying her distant cousin, Franklin. Hick, as she was known, had grown up poor in rural South Dakota and worked as a servant girl after she escaped an abusive home, eventually becoming one of the most respected reporters at the AP. Her admiration drew the buttoned-up Eleanor out of her shell, and the two quickly fell in love. For the next thirteen years, Hick had her own room at the White House, next door to the First Lady.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> These fiercely compassionate women inspired each other to right the wrongs of the turbulent era in which they lived. During the Depression, Hick reported from the nation&#x2019;s poorest areas for the WPA, and Eleanor used these reports to lobby her husband for New Deal programs. Hick encouraged Eleanor to turn their frequent letters into her popular and long-lasting syndicated column "My Day," and to befriend the female journalists who became her champions. When Eleanor&#x2019;s tenure as First Lady ended with FDR's death, Hick pushed her to continue to use her popularity for good&#x2014;advice Eleanor took by leading the UN&#x2019;s postwar Human Rights Commission. At every turn, the bond these women shared was grounded in their determination to better their troubled world.<br> &nbsp;<br>Deeply researched and told with great warmth,&nbsp;<i>Eleanor and Hick&nbsp;</i>is a vivid portrait of love and a revealing look at how an unlikely romance influenced some of the most consequential years in American history.</p><p>Susan Quinn is the author of <i>Furious Improvisation: How the WPA and a Cast of Thousands Made High Art Out of Desperate Times</i> and <i>Marie Curie: A Life</i>, among other books.

Even his advisers were worried. FDR came up with a defiant answer to all of them: a nine-thousand-mile, twenty-one-day trip through seventeen midwestern and western states aboard the Roosevelt Special.<br><br>It was a trip perfectly suited to both FDR&#x2019;s temperament and his physical limitations. As soon as the train came to a stop, FDR stepped out on the rear platform, gripping the arm of his son Jimmy. The railing cut off sight of his lower body, so the public saw only his broad shoulders and chest as he delivered his one-minute address. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice to be back in Dubuque,&#x201d; he would begin, flashing his wide smile, adding, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just here to look, learn, and listen.&#x201d; His speech was patrician, but his message was friendly, and his physical courage buoyed his worried listeners.<br><br>Between stops, FDR had only to look out the train window to see just how bad things had become. In Chicago, there were blocks of lifeless factories, overgrown parks, and rows of vacant stores with blackened windows. Shantytowns, clustered along the railroad tracks, sent up smoke from cooking fires. In the rich farm country of Iowa and Ohio, the farmhouses were unpainted, the fences were crumbling, and food was rotting in the fields. By the time the Roosevelt Special reached Seattle, Roosevelt had reason to speak &#x201c;in the name of a stricken America and a stricken world.&#x201d;<br><br>Even in such terrible times, however, Franklin Roosevelt managed to enjoy himself. He loved everything about campaigning, from the enthusiasm of the local crowds to the sparring with the newspaper &#x201c;boys.&#x201d; FDR&#x2019;s sitting room was open to all comers: local politicians got on and off, and close advisers and future cabinet members huddled late into the night, plotting a future course for a country in crisis. FDR enhanced his listening and learning with healthy doses of jokes, storytelling, poker, and booze.<br><br>Eleanor Roosevelt waited until the return journey from the West Coast to join the Roosevelt Special. She didn&#x2019;t share her husband&#x2019;s enthusiasm for the cheering admirers on the campaign trail. &#x201c;It seems undignified and&nbsp;meaningless but perhaps we need it!&#x201d; she once confided. She wasn&#x2019;t �comfortable with the jocular atmosphere around FDR, either. Try as she might, Eleanor didn&#x2019;t always get the jokes and was uncomfortable with the teasing. On her honeymoon, she had refused to join a bridge game that involved money, because she had been raised to think it was improper. Drinking, especially, made her uneasy. She had her own reasons for disliking even the smell of alcohol: her father had drunk himself to death, and it now looked as though her brother was going down the same path.<br><br>Eleanor had plenty to say about policy issues. But the politicians and brain trusters who surrounded Franklin rarely thought to include her in their discussions. The exception was Louis Howe, a wizened little man with a scarred face and bulging eyes who had been a true believer in FDR&#x2019;s greatness since they met in 1911. Eleanor Roosevelt had been repelled by Howe in the early days: he was an inelegant chain-smoking newspaperman, the sort of person she had been brought up to avoid. But Howe&#x2019;s attentions to her in 1920, when FDR was running for vice president on the ill-fated Democratic ticket, went a long way toward changing her mind. When Franklin was stricken with polio on Campobello Island, Eleanor and Louis became a team. They were the only ones who believed that FDR had a political future in those years immediately following the diagnosis. Howe came to understand then that Eleanor could keep Roosevelt aspirations alive while FDR recovered. He urged her to lower her high-pitched voice and suppress her nervous giggle when she spoke in public, and he&nbsp;encouraged her to get more involved in New York politics. In time, he even had the idea that Eleanor should run for president herself.<br><br>For Louis Howe, the trip on the Roosevelt Special was a dream come true: he&#x2019;d been working toward the presidential run ever since Franklin Roosevelt first served in the New York state legislature. Shrewd political operative that he was, Howe was confident that the Hoover campaign was doomed and that FDR was about to become the next president of the United States.<br><br>Eleanor Roosevelt didn&#x2019;t want to believe it. The spark that Howe had ignited in her had led to a new, independent life. She was the cofounder of a craft workshop called Val-Kill Industries, a cofounder and teacher at a girls&#x2019; school, and an activist with other women in New York politics. What&#x2019;s more, she knew a fair amount about the ceremonial burden involved in being First Lady: her aunt Edith had been an exemplary one for her uncle Theodore. She didn&#x2019;t want any part of it. She had been as passionate as Howe about FDR&#x2019;s political rehabilitation. But she didn&#x2019;t share his excitement now, as the Roosevelt Special gained momentum.<br><br>It was comforting, under the circumstances, when the campaign train went off on a side rail so that she could pay a visit to an old friend who&nbsp;would understand and sympathize. Eleanor and Isabella Greenway had endured &#x201c;coming out&#x201d; as debutantes in consecutive years&#x2014;both&nbsp;looked upon it as more duty than pleasure&#x2014;and Isabella had been a bridesmaid in the Roosevelt wedding, staying by Eleanor&#x2019;s side as they organized the myriad presents and even composing some of the thank-you notes. Since then, Isabella had married Robert Ferguson, an old family friend, and moved with him to Prescott, Arizona, in hopes that the dry climate would cure his tuberculosis.<br><br>Since Eleanor and her husband kept friends forever, it was natural for them to take a day off from the campaign trail, away from press and public, to visit Isabella and her husband in Prescott. Journalists were more obliging in those days: photographers agreed not to take pictures that included FDR&#x2019;s wheelchair. No picture of FDR in a crablike position, as his prone and helpless body was lifted in and out of his automobile, ever made the newspapers. Giving the family a day off to visit friends was all right with them.<br><br>What did surprise and rankle the reporters, though, was that an exception was made for one rookie <i>Chicago Tribune </i>reporter named John Boettiger, who for some reason was asked to come along on the private visit. No one resented this slight more than Lorena Hickok. Hick was the only �female reporter on the Roosevelt Special and one of the top female reporters in the country, and she&#x2019;d gotten there by fighting for stories. &#x201c;Most women,&#x201d; fellow reporter Walter B. &#x201c;Rags&#x201d; Ragsdale noted, &#x201c;were society editors or worked the social beat. The rarities were women who fought and scratched their way to the street as regular reporters.&#x201d; Another reporter who knew her well noticed that a red rash tended to develop on the back of Hick&#x2019;s neck if she thought she was getting cheated out of a plum �assignment.&nbsp;<br><br>Hick had already complained when she discovered that all the men on the Roosevelt Special had compartments or drawing rooms in which to sleep and work, while she was stuck with a small berth up toward the engine, in the neighborhood of the local reporters. So naturally she was furious about John Boettiger, an inexperienced reporter, getting special treatment. She decided to complain to Eleanor Roosevelt about it.<br><br>Hick didn&#x2019;t expect the reaction she got: Eleanor Roosevelt invited her to come along too. Hick was intrigued, and a little puzzled. Eleanor had kept her at a distance in the past. When she had interviewed Eleanor at the governor&#x2019;s mansion, she had been invited up to the drawing room for an elegant tea, poured from a silver pot. On that day, like all others, �Lorena Hickok dressed to be taken seriously: a soft silk shirt collar over a suit jacket and a skirt, of course. She was a presence. Her legs were shapely, her shoes sensible. She had a round face with a strong, determined jaw, and intense, penetrating eyes. At five foot eight, she was broad without looking fat.<br><br>Though hardly a fashion plate herself, Hick had felt sorry for Eleanor. She could tell that Eleanor felt homely, despite her warm blue eyes and winning smile. She dressed abominably, in Hick&#x2019;s view: her skirt was too long, her blouse was a terrible green, and she wore a hairnet with an elastic that cut into her forehead. She had inherited the protruding front teeth of the Teddy Roosevelt branch of the family.<br><br>Yet Eleanor had a natural elegance when she moved. Hick was struck by her long slender hands and the graceful way she manipulated the tea things. At tea that day, Eleanor kept everything friendly but bland. Hick had a strong impression that the governor&#x2019;s wife didn&#x2019;t trust her. That was why she was surprised when Eleanor asked her to come along to Prescott: something had changed. Hick, ever the reporter, soon figured it out: it all had to do with a long conversation she&#x2019;d had late one night with Eleanor&#x2019;s secretary, Malvina Thompson, as the two of them kept each other company on the Roosevelt Special.<br><br>Malvina Thompson, known to everyone as Tommy, was much more than the usual secretary: she was Eleanor&#x2019;s fiercely loyal friend and traveling companion, always willing to work at Eleanor&#x2019;s demanding pace. The two had met while both were working on Al Smith&#x2019;s 1928 presidential campaign. Afterward, Tommy became secretary to Louie Howe, but she worked on the side for Eleanor. By the time FDR was elected governor of New York, Tommy and Eleanor were a full-time team. Tommy was married until 1939, and had another man in her life after that. But most of her waking hours were devoted to the woman she called &#x201c;Mrs. R.&#x201d; Tommy and Hick had a lot in common: they were born the same year, came from the working class, smoked, drank, and held strong opinions. It was natural for them to gravitate toward each other when work was done.<br><br>The train moved along at a measured pace during the day, when FDR was sitting up in his custom-built chair in the parlor car. If it went too fast, the jerks and jiggles made it hard for him to steady himself for reading and conversation. At night, the engineer made up for lost time, hurtling though the dark. It may have been a train whistle late one night that prompted Tommy Thompson to share a childhood memory with Hick about her father, who had worked as a locomotive engineer on the railroad. He would sound three short blasts on the train whistle in a private salute as the train roared past the family&#x2019;s apartment windows in the Bronx.<br><br>It was such a touching idea and so at odds with Hick&#x2019;s own childhood memories that it prompted her to open up to Tommy about her painful past. Hick&#x2019;s mother had died when she was thirteen, leaving her to deal with her violent, abusive father. Within a year, he remarried, and the stepmother kicked her out of the house. From age fourteen on, she had had to make her own way in the hardscrabble pioneer towns of South Dakota, living in other people&#x2019;s houses as a hired girl.<br><br>When Eleanor heard Hick&#x2019;s story from Thompson, it changed her view of the tough AP reporter. Because her own life had been scarred by loss and disappointment, she was drawn to others who had suffered and struggled. After that, she began to suspect what Hick&#x2019;s fellow reporters already knew. There was the surface Hick: blas� and shock-proof, a tough-minded reporter who knew how to drink and smoke with the boys, and who fought for her rights. Then there was the tender-hearted and sometimes shy Hick underneath, who bore witness to the suffering of ordinary people in those terrible times.<br><br>Long before she joined the AP, back when she was a reporter for the <i>Minneapolis Tribune</i>, Hick could be relied on to find and tell the most vivid stories of hardship: long, detailed pieces about girls who came to Minneapolis from little farm towns and got into trouble, about an injured worker who decided to crawl under a bridge and starve to death, about an organ grinder whose monkey was stolen.&nbsp;<br><br>Hick was still looking for such stories on the campaign trail. Her fellow reporter Rags Ragsdale would often cover FDR&#x2019;s whistle-stop speeches while Hick circulated in the crowd and talked to people about their lives. &#x201c;Many times, she came back aboard the campaign train,&#x201d; Ragsdale remembered, &#x201c;fuming and almost tearful over a hard-luck story she had picked up from someone in the crowd.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>There were unending hard-luck stories. During a stopover in Topeka, Kansas, Hick watched Franklin Roosevelt address thousands of &#x201c;deeply tanned, grim-faced farmers, some so ragged that they reminded one of pictures of starving Mongolian peasants in the rotogravure sections of the Sunday papers. They did not cheer. They did not applaud. They just stood there in the broiling sun, silent, listening.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>After her day with Eleanor in Prescott, Hick realized why rookie reporter John Boettiger was getting special treatment: he was having an affair with the Roosevelts&#x2019; oldest child, Anna, who was unhappily married to Curtis Dall. Not long after, both Anna and John would divorce in order to marry each other.<br><br>The divorce was fodder for the gossip columns when it finally happened. But when Hick came back from her day with the Roosevelts and briefed her fellow reporters, she talked about the ranch and the barbecue, not the affair. It was the first of many family secrets she would keep.&nbsp;<br><br>The more important discovery Hick made that day was that Eleanor Roosevelt was at least as fascinating as her husband. &#x201c;Lorena was as excited as I ever saw her when she came back,&#x201d; Ragsdale remembered. &#x201c;From this time forward it became hard for her to write with the usual AP restraint about Mrs. Roosevelt.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>In the past, Hick had avoided writing about politicians&#x2019; wives: fashion, teas, and charity events were women&#x2019;s page stuff, and she&#x2019;d escaped that long before, during her initiation at the <i>Milwaukee Sentinel</i>. Eleanor, in turn, resisted the curiosity of reporters, especially if it touched on anything personal. Her grandmother had taught her that it was unseemly to&nbsp;appear in the public eye. &#x201c;I gave as little information as possible,&#x201d; she explained in her first memoir, &#x201c;feeling that that was the only right attitude toward any newspaper people where a woman and her home were concerned.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Eleanor had good reason to be wary of all reporters. As the Boettiger incident would make clear, things went on in the Roosevelt household that needed to be kept away from the scandal-loving press.

America Before, detailed and wide-ranging, turns what was myth and legend into a new story of the past.&#39; Daily Mail Was an advanced civilization lost to history in the global cataclysm that ended the last Ice Age? Graham Hancock, the internationally bestselling author, has made it his life&#39;s work to find out -- and in America Before, he draws on the latest archaeological and DNA evidence to bring his quest to a stunning conclusion.We&#39;ve been taught that North and South America were empty of humans until around 13,000 years ago - amongst the last great landmasses on earth to have been settled by our ancestors. But new discoveries have radically reshaped this long-established picture and we know now that the Americas were first peopled more than 130,000 years ago - many tens of thousands of years before human settlements became established elsewhere.Hancock&#39;s research takes us on a series of journeys and encounters with the scientists responsible for the recent extraordinary breakthroughs. In the process, from the Mississippi Valley to the Amazon rainforest, he reveals that ancient &#39;New World&#39; cultures share a legacy of advanced scientific knowledge and sophisticated spiritual beliefs with supposedly unconnected &#39;Old World&#39; cultures. Have archaeologists focussed for too long only on the &#39;Old World&#39; in their search for the origins of civilization while failing to consider the revolutionary possibility that those origins might in fact be found in the &#39;New World&#39;?America Before: The Key to Earth&#39;s Lost Civilisation is the culmination of everything that millions of readers have loved in Hancock&#39;s body of work over the past decades, namely a mind-dilating exploration of the mysteries of the past, amazing archaeological discoveries and profound implications for how we lead our lives today.</p><p></p><h2>The Wildlife of Star Wars: A Field Guide</h2><p>Designed as a naturalist&#39;s sketch book (with a genuine dewback hide cover) and featuring the meticulous illustrations of Star Wars&#39; artist Terryl Whitlatch, The Wildlife of Star Wars is truly the definitive guide to the creatures of George Lucas&#39;s mega creation. With simple pen and ink, the artist captures the unusual anatomy, the extraordinary behavior, and the rainbow hues of the most interesting wildlife on Naboo, Hoth, Endor, and the other planets of Star Wars.

Lucy and Edmund, with their dreadful cousin Eustace, get magically pulled into a painting of a ship at sea. That ship is the <i>Dawn Treader</i>, and on board is Caspian, King of Narnia. He and his companions, including Reepicheep, the valiant warrior mouse, are searching for seven lost lords of Narnia, and their voyage will take them to the edge of the world. Their adventures include being captured by slave traders, a much-too-close encounter with a dragon, and visits to many enchanted islands, including the place where dreams come true. The adaptation is faithful to its source, C.S. Lewis's series of Narnia books, which have provided exciting and uplifting tales for generations of children. BBC Radio does wonders with sound effects--the ship creaks in the wind, the sorrowful dragon roars lugubriously--and musical cues and interludes that keep the pacing dynamic. There's also a splendid cast of plummy British voices, making this far more than a book read onto cassette--it's an audio drama, as enjoyable as a trip to the theater. Grownups who buy this tape for their children will want to borrow it for themselves.

Marshall, Vol. 4: Statesman, 1945-1959</h2><p>Describes Marshall&#39;s accomplishments as special ambassador to China, Secretary of State, and Secretary of Defense, and looks at his influence on American postwar politics</p><p>Army chief of staff from 1939 to 1945, Marshall directed the organization and training of U.S. land and air forces during World War II. The fourth and final volume of Pogue's biography deals with Marshall's "other dimension" as statesman, humanitarian and peacemaker during his tenure as Secretary of State, head of the American Red Cross and Secretary of Defense during the middle period of the Korean War. This remarkable later career included Marshall's struggle to bring peace to China in the postwar years; his initiation and implementation of the European Recovery Program (the Marshall Plan); his role in the establishment of NATO and the State of Israel; his reaction to assaults by the radical right led by Sen. Joseph McCarthy; and his working relationship as defense secretary with Secretary of State Dean Acheson, probably the most successful collaboration in the history of the two departments. Pogue, former director of the Marshall Library, thus rounds off his monumental study of one of the great leaders of the 20th century. Photos. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Superbly researched and written, the fourth and final volume of Pogue's monumental study portrays a man who after years of military accomplishment took on the numerous and weighty challenges of the post-World War II world. His vision and understanding of U.S. postwar responsibilities saved Europe from economic collapse and political turmoil. Pogue richly details Marshall's many achievements: his struggle to bring peace to China, his role in the evolution of a new U.S. foreign policy, his duels with the Soviet Union over the future of Germany, and his leadership in formulating and selling the Marshall Plan. Marshall emerges as a man of unfailing dedication to his country, whatever the emotional or physical cost, and of immense integrity. Highly recommended to both academic and public libraries.

The drive from Luena was long and arduous due to unexploded land mines in the area, which required extreme diligence and caution to avoid as they drove. After forty years of conflict and civil war, the country was still ravaged and in desperate need of all the help outside sources could provide, which was why Ginny Carter had been there, sent by SOS Human Rights. SOS/HR was a private foundation based in New York that sent human rights workers around the globe. Her assignments were usually two or three months long in any given location, occasionally longer. She was sent in as part of a support team, to address whatever human rights issues were being violated or in question, typically to assist women and children, or even to address the most pressing physical needs in a trouble spot somewhere, like lack of food, water, medicine, or shelter. She frequently got involved in legal issues, visiting women in prisons, interfacing with attorneys, and trying to get the women fair trials. SOS took good care of their workers and was a responsible organization, but the work was dangerous at times. She had taken an in-depth training course before they sent her into the field initially, and had been taught about everything from digging ditches and purifying water, to extensive first aid, but nothing had prepared her for what she had seen since. She had learned a great deal about man&#x2019;s cruelty to man and the plight of people in underdeveloped countries and emerging nations since she&#x2019;d started working for SOS/HR.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As she cleared customs at JFK airport in New York, Ginny had been traveling for twenty-seven hours, after the flight from Luanda to London, the four-hour layover at Heathrow, and then the flight to New York. She was wearing jeans, hiking boots, and a heavy army surplus parka, her blond hair shoved haphazardly into a rubber band when she woke up on the plane just before they landed. She had been in Africa for four months, since August, longer than usual, and was arriving in New York on December&nbsp;22. She had hoped to be back out on assignment by now, but her replacement had not gotten to them on time. Ginny had tried to orchestrate her absence from New York at this time, but now she had to face Christmas alone in New York.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She could have gone to Los Angeles to spend the holiday with her father and sister, but that sounded even worse. She had left L.A. nearly three years before, and had no desire to return to the city where she had grown up. Since leaving L.A., she had lived the life of a nomad, as she put it, working for SOS Human Rights. She loved the work, and the fact that it was all-consuming, and most of the time kept her from thinking about her own life, a life which, in her wildest dreams, she had never imagined she would be living and working in the countries that were familiar to her now. She had helped midwives to deliver babies, or done it herself when there was no one else at hand. She had held dying children in her arms, and comforted their mothers, and cared for orphans in displacement camps. She had been in war-torn areas, lived through two local uprisings and a revolution, and had seen anguish, poverty, and devastation that she would otherwise never have encountered in her lifetime. It put everything else in life into perspective. SOS/HR was grateful for her willingness to travel to some of the worst areas it serviced, no matter how desolate or dangerous, or how rugged conditions were. The more rugged the conditions, and the harder the work, the better she liked it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She cared nothing about the potential dangers to herself. She had actually disappeared for three weeks in Afghanistan, and the home office had thought she had been killed. Her family in Los Angeles feared it might be the case, but she had come back to camp weak and sick, having been taken in and cared for by a local family who had nursed her through a high fever. She seemed to welcome and embrace the worst SOS/HR had to offer. And they could always count on her to show up and stick it out. She had been in Afghanistan, several parts of Africa, and Pakistan. Her reports were accurate, insightful, and helpful, and twice she had made presentations to the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights at the United Nations, and once to the Human Rights High Commissioner in Geneva. She was impressive in describing, in all its poignancy and pathos, the plight of those she served.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She was worn and tired when she landed in New York. She had been sad to leave the women and children she had been caring for in a refugee camp in Luena, Angola. The human rights workers had been trying to relocate them, despite a web of red tape that prevented them from accomplishing their mission. She would have liked to stay for another six months or a year. Their three-month assignments always seemed too short. They just became familiar with the conditions in the country when they were replaced, but their job was to report accurately on local conditions as much as to change them. They did what they could while they were there, but it was like emptying the ocean with a thimble. There were so many people in desperate need, and so many women and children in dire circumstances around the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And yet Ginny was able to find joy in what she did, and couldn&#x2019;t wait to leave again on another assignment. She wanted to spend as little time as possible in New York, and she was dreading the holidays. She would have preferred to spend them working to the point of exhaustion in a place where Christmas didn&#x2019;t exist, as it didn&#x2019;t now to her. It was rotten luck that she had landed in New York three days before Christmas, the worst days of the year for her. All she wanted to do was sleep when she got back to her apartment, and wake up when it was over. The holidays meant nothing to her except pain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She had nothing to declare in customs except a few small wooden carvings the children in the refugee camp had made for her. Her treasures now were the memories she carried with her everywhere, of the people she met along the way. She had no interest in material possessions, and everything she traveled with was in a small battered suitcase and the backpack she wore. She never had time to look in a mirror when she was working, and didn&#x2019;t care. A hot shower was her greatest luxury and pleasure, when she was able to take one; the rest of the time she took cold showers, using the soap she brought with her. Her jeans and sweatshirts and T-shirts were clean but never pressed. It was enough that she had clothes to wear, which was more than many of the people she cared for had, and she often gave her clothes away to those who needed them more. Except for a Senate hearing where she spoke eloquently, she hadn&#x2019;t worn a dress, high heels, or makeup in three years. And when she made her presentations to the United Nations or the Human Rights Commission, she did so in a pair of old black slacks, a sweater, and flat shoes. The only thing important to her was what she had to say, the message they needed to hear, and the atrocities she had seen on a daily basis in the course of her work. She had a front-row seat to the cruelties and crimes committed against women and children around the world. And she owed it to them to speak on their behalf when asked to do so when she came home. Her words were always powerful and well chosen and brought tears to the eyes of those who heard her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She walked out of the terminal and took a deep breath of cold night air. Holiday travelers were rushing to buses and taxis or greeting relatives outside the terminal, as Ginny silently watched them with deep blue eyes the color of a lake. They were almost navy blue. She looked serious for a moment, debating whether to take a shuttle or a cab into the city. She was bone tired, and her body ached from the long trip, and from sleeping in cramped quarters in coach. She felt guilty spending money on herself after what she saw in the course of her missions, but she decided to spoil herself. She walked to the curb and hailed a taxi, which swerved and rapidly approached to pick her up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She opened the door and put her bag and backpack into the back seat, climbed in, and closed the door, as the young Pakistani driver checked her out and asked where she was going. She saw his name on the license on the partition between them as she gave him her address, and an instant later they took off, darting through the airport traffic, and headed toward the highway. It felt strange to be back in civilization after the desolate area where she&#x2019;d been living for the past four months. But she always felt that way when she returned, and by the time she got adjusted to it, she left again. She always asked that they reassign her quickly, and most of the time they did. She was one of their most valuable workers in the field, both for her willingness and for her expertise after almost three years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Where are you from in Pakistan?&#x201d; she asked him as they joined the flow of traffic moving toward the city, and he smiled at her in the rearview mirror. He was young and looked pleased that she had guessed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;How did you know I&#x2019;m from Pakistan?&#x201d; he asked her, and she smiled back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I was there a year ago.&#x201d; She guessed his region then, and he looked amazed. Few Americans knew anything about his country. &#x201c;I was in Balochistan for three months.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What were you doing there?&#x201d; He was intrigued by her as traffic slowed them down. It was going to be a long, slow ride into the city in holiday traffic, and talking to him kept her awake. He seemed more familiar to her than the people she would meet in New York, who seemed like foreigners to her now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I was working,&#x201d; she said quietly, glancing out the window at what should have been a familiar landscape but no longer was. She felt like a woman without a home, and had felt that way since she left L.A. She sensed now that that would be the last real home she&#x2019;d ever have, and she preferred it that way. She didn&#x2019;t need a home anymore&#x2014;whatever tent or camp she was living in was enough for her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you a doctor?&#x201d; He was curious about her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I work for a human rights organization,&#x201d; she said vaguely, fighting waves of fatigue as she sat in the warm, comfortable cab. She didn&#x2019;t want to fall asleep until she got back to her apartment, had a shower, and could climb into her bed. She knew that the fridge would be empty, but she didn&#x2019;t care, she had eaten on the plane. She didn&#x2019;t want to eat that night and could buy whatever she needed the next day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They drove on in silence then, and she watched the skyline of New York come into view. It was undeniably beautiful, but it looked like a movie set to her and not a place where real people lived. The people she knew lived in old military barracks, refugee stations, and tents, not brightly lit cities with skyscrapers and apartment buildings. With the passing years, she felt more and more separate from this way of life each time she returned, but the organization she worked for was based in New York, and it made sense for her to keep an apartment here. It was a shell she crawled into briefly once every few months, like a hermit crab needing a place to stay. She had no attachment to it, and had never considered it home. The only personal things she had were still in boxes she had never bothered to unpack. Her sister, Rebecca, had packed them for her when Ginny sold her house and left L.A., and shipped them to her in New York. Ginny didn&#x2019;t even know what was in them, and didn&#x2019;t care.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It took them just over an hour to reach her apartment, and she paid the driver with a generous tip. He smiled at her again and thanked her, as she looked for her keys in a pocket of her backpack, then stepped out into the frigid air. It felt like it was going to snow. She stood fumbling with the lock to her building for a moment, with her bags on the pavement beside her. The facade looked faintly battered, and there was a chill wind coming from the East River a block away. She lived in the upper eighties near East End, and she had rented the apartment because she liked walking along the river in warmer weather, and watching the boats drift by. After living in a house in L.A. for years, living in an apartment seemed less oppressive and more impersonal, which she preferred.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She let herself into the building and pressed the button of the elevator to the sixth floor. Everything in the building had a dreary look to it. She noticed that several of her neighbors had Christmas wreaths on their doors. She didn&#x2019;t bother with Christmas decorations anymore, and this was only the second time she&#x2019;d been there for Christmas since she&#x2019;d moved to New York. There were so many more important things to think about in the world than putting up a tree or a wreath on the door. She was anxious to get to the office, but knew that it would be closed for the next several days. She was planning to do some reading, work on her latest report, summing up her mission, and catch up on sleep. The report would keep her busy for the next week, and all she had to do was pretend that it wasn&#x2019;t the holidays.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She turned on the lights when she walked in, and saw that nothing had changed. The beaten-up old couch she had gotten at a garage sale in Brooklyn looked as tired as it had before. She had bought a well-used, secondhand leather recliner, and it was the most comfortable chair she&#x2019;d ever owned. She often fell asleep in it while she was reading. There was another large chair facing the couch in case she had a guest, which she never did. But if so, she was prepared. Her coffee table was an old metal trunk with travel stickers on it that she had bought when she got the couch. There was a small dining table and four unmatched chairs, and a dead plant on the windowsill that she had meant to throw away in July, had forgotten, and it had become part of the decor. The person who cleaned her apartment once a month didn&#x2019;t dare throw it away. She had a few old lamps that cast a warm light around the room, and a television she almost never used. She read the news on the Internet, which she preferred. And the d�cor in her bedroom consisted of the bed, a chest she had also bought secondhand, and a chair. There was nothing on the walls. It wasn&#x2019;t a cozy place to come home to, but it was a place to sleep and keep her clothes. She had a cleaning woman who came once a month when she was away, and once a week when she was there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She dropped her suitcase and backpack in her bedroom, came back to the living room, and sat down on the couch, which was welcoming, despite the way it looked. She leaned her head back, thinking about how far she&#x2019;d come in the past twenty-eight hours. She felt as though she had been on another planet, and had just returned to Earth. She was still thinking about it when her cell phone rang.

So when Meg's dad generously offers to help out anyone who can no longer care for their four-legged charges, a parade of wild creatures begins to make Meg and Michael's newly renovated house look more like Noah's ark.<br>Meg and Michael have been planning to elope in order to avoid the elaborate wedding their mothers have begun to organize---a plan that's threatened by both the murder investigation and the carnival of animals.

Their route swept down from the northlands, along the great frothing river that flowed from the glaciers to the sea, and over a cluster of small mountains. These were the Teligmar Hills of Mirwell Province, located on the western border of Sacoridia.<br><br>Perhaps the raptors were relieved when they saw the hills bulging on the horizon, for they were landmarks that helped guide the way, and the rising north wind gave loft to wings that had many hundreds of miles yet to fly, easing the toil of the journey. They hovered on updrafts over the rounded, weathered summits, resting on air currents and keeping an eye out for prey, maybe a stray songbird intent on its own imperative to migrate, or an unwary rodent.<br><br>This year, the raptors, with their sharp vision, spotted something new and curious among the mountains: humans. Numerous humans had taken up residence on one of the summits. There were clusters of tents and other structures among the trees and rocks, wood smoke wafting in the air, voices carried by the wind, and metal glinting in the morning sun. The raptors sensed a strange power down there, something their small bird minds could not grasp, but definitely something that ruffled their feathers.<br><br> Whatever it was, the concerns of the raptors rested with their own journey south, not with the affairs of humans. They left behind the Teligmar Hills, and would soon leave the land of Sacoridia to its winter, the Earth wheeling beneath the trailing edges of their wings.<br><br>As soon as the woman stepped out of her tent, she was greeted by the excited voices of children. They clustered around her, all chattering at once, tugging on her skirt for attention, showing her where a baby tooth was newly missing, asking her to play games or tell stories. She laughed and patted heads, the crinkles around her eyes and mouth deepening.<br><br>It was a mild autumn morning, but the cold breezes swept over the top of the small mountain&#x2019;s summit as they always did, tumbling leaves about her feet in whorls, and loosening a lock of steel gray hair from her braid. She tired of the wind, but the children didn&#x2019;t mind it, and she&#x2019;d seen plenty of hawks using it as they passed south. The mountain her people camped on was aptly named Hawk Hill.<br><br>&#x201c;Now, now, my children,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;There will be time to play games and tell stories later. Right now I need to see Ferdan. Ferdan? Where are you?&#x201d;<br><br>A towheaded boy raised his hand and the woman waded through the children to reach him. His face was drawn, with circles under his eyes and a smudge of dirt on his chin. His shirt was not buttoned correctly, as if he had dressed himself.<br><br>&#x201c;How is your mum today?&#x201d; she asked. She knelt to rebutton his shirt and straighten it out.<br><br>&#x201c;Not too good,&#x201d; the boy said. &#x201c;Coughing real bad.&#x201d;<br><br>When the woman finished with his shirt, she stood and pressed a pouch fragrant with herbs into the boy&#x2019;s small hand. &#x201c;Tell her to take this with her tea, a pinch thrice daily, no more, no less. It will help clear her lungs. Keep water steaming in a pot nearby for her to breathe. It will make her easier. You understand? Be careful not to burn yourself.&#x201d; When Ferdan&#x2019;s expression of worry did not alter, she tousled his hair and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be along to visit her this afternoon. Now you go and see that your mum has some of that tea.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Grandmother,&#x201d; Ferdan said, and he darted off to a lean-to draped with a stained blanket used both for privacy and to keep out the weather, the pouch clutched to his breast.<br><br>She would see to it his mother pulled through. It was a tragedy that any child should lose their mum. She shook her head and turned her attention to the rest of the children. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it time you went to your lessons with Master Holdt?&#x201d; There was whining and groaning from the children, but no real rebellion, and she shooed them away, chuckling.<br><br>Only one child remained after all the others left, a little girl who was the woman&#x2019;s true granddaughter, Lala. Lala was too simple in her mind for lessons and she did not like playing with the other children. Nor did she talk. So most of the time she shadowed her grandmother or played by herself.<br><br>While the woman was Lala&#x2019;s grandmother by blood, she was also known as Grandmother to all her people in the encampment. She birthed their babies, provided them with medicines when they were sick, cared for their wounds, and counseled them on matters of marriage and family. <br>She also led them in their spiritual beliefs. When it came time to flee Sacor City and seek safe haven, it was her they had looked to; it was her they followed on the grueling journey across the country all the way west to Mirwell Province, sometimes traveling along roads, but more often than not making their way through the unforgiving wilderness of the Green Cloak Forest. It had not been easy, and not all survived the journey, but those who did expressed their gratitude for her foresight and wisdom.<br><br>She was a simple woman, glad to be of comfort to them and honored by their trust. Leaving Sacor City had meant a great deal of upheaval and sacrifice. They&#x2019;d left behind trades, businesses, respectable posts in the community; farms, homesteads, and houses. She had worried most about the children in the beginning, but learned over the ensuing months just how resilient the young ones were. This was a grand adventure for them, camping and hiding out in the wilds of the countryside, and the older boys liked to play &#x201c;outlaw,&#x201d; which usually involved the &#x201c;king&#x201d; and his men running after the &#x201c;outlaws&#x201d; of Second Empire, and ending when the outlaws slew the enemy with the sticks they used for swords. The empire always prevailed, the lads cheering with gusto.<br><br>The hiding and camping tended to be harder on the adults, who recognized what they had given up and left behind forever. Yes, they had lost much, but they still possessed their freedom and their lives, and here they could wear their pendants or tattoos of the black tree unhidden. One day, Grandmother believed, the black tree of Mornhavonia would bloom again, but in the meantime they would not be at the mercy of king&#x2019;s law.<br><br>When the king discovered the existence of Second Empire over the summer, the sect in Sacor City began to collapse almost immediately with the capture of their leader, Weldon Spurlock. It was not Weldon who had revealed them, but another of their group, Westley Uxton. Names had been given, which led to more arrests and someone else giving additional names, and so on. Grandmother managed to escape with little more than a hundred of the faithful.<br><br>Others chose to remain in Sacor City on the chance they&#x2019;d not be discovered, and so had those who were too elderly or unfit to travel. Some took their own lives lest they be used by the king to acquire information, and a few were operatives who knew how to evade capture.<br><br>The refugees from Sacor City occupied one side of the gray granite summit, where children recited lessons with Master Holdt and their parents washed laundry, repaired household goods, tended chickens and goats, and prepared for stalking game along the flanks of the mountain. The soldiers camped across from them, where they currently sharpened blades, practiced swordplay, and ate breakfast. Their tents and sturdy lean-tos were tucked into clusters of boulders and against outcrops.<br><br>The soldiers were not children of the empire, but had been equally persecuted by the king. Some were bandits, mercenaries, and deserters, but most were loyalists of the old Lord Mirwell, who had attempted to depose the king two years ago. The loyalists had been forced into hiding to avoid arrest and the inevitable execution.<br><br>Grandmother was convinced it was God who had brought her people and the soldiers together, unlikely allies though they may be. Her people required protection, and she needed to start building an army, and blessing be, she found the leader of the soldiers at a crossroads during their exodus. She had no gold to pay the soldiers with, no position in life with which to reward them&#x2014;at least not yet&#x2014;but she had been able to give them purpose, for they shared a common enemy: the king and Sacoridia.<br><br>When the time was right, she would expand their ranks with the devout of Second Empire. Already some of the men and older boys of her sect trained with the soldiers. Others remained embedded with their units in provincial and private militias, as well as the king&#x2019;s own military. When she called, they would come to her well trained and ready to attend to whatever task she set before them.<br><br>Her ancestors had been wise to melt into everyday Sacoridian society, spreading a network of sects across the provinces and into Rhovanny as well. They had infiltrated not only the military, but the trades and guilds. They ran farms and sold wares. They lived as any Sacoridian did, but secretly awaited the time when the empire would rise again.<br><br>One day they would rule over those who had been their neighbors, control all trade and the military. The empire would finally conquer this land of heathens. This was the dream of the five who founded Second Empire in the aftermath of the Long War, and Grandmother did not think the fruition of that dream far off.<br><br>Such thoughts always warmed her, made her proud of her people. Over a millennium they had endured, keeping their secrets, and waiting ever so patiently. Their day would come.<br><br>The officer who commanded the soldiers made his way across the summit to where she stood taking in the morning and halted before her. They had an appointment.<br><br>&#x201c;Lala, dear,&#x201d; she said, turning to her granddaughter, &#x201c;fetch my basket, please.&#x201d;<br><br>The little girl ducked into the tent they shared, and reemerged almost instantly with a long-handled basket that contained skeins of Grandmother&#x2019;s yarn.<br><br>The soldier awaiting her pleasure was tall and broad-shouldered and moved with the grace of any well-trained, disciplined warrior. He wore tough fighting leathers and a serviceable longsword in a scarred sheath on his right hip. His flesh also bore the scars of battle, notably a patch over his eye and the hook on his right wrist that replaced his missing hand. He had once been a favorite of the old lord-governor&#x2019;s, and proved experienced and highly capable. Grandmother liked him very much.<br><br>&#x201c;Good morning, Captain Immerez,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Morning.&#x201d; His voice was low and gravelly. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re ready for you.&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded and followed him across the summit. Without looking, she knew Lala tagged along carrying the basket. The girl was always interested, or perhaps entertained, by her grandmother&#x2019;s activities, whether it was healing the sick or punishing transgressors. Since Lala did not speak or show much in the way of emotion, it was hard to say what she thought about anything. Still, she was biddable, and her silence did not bother Grandmother in the least, for she was used to it. She had cut the girl from the womb of her own dead daughter nine years ago, and even then, though the baby had survived, she uttered not a sound when she emerged into the world, and had not made a sound since.<br><br>The captain led them to a corner of the encampment where the prisoner sat bound beneath the watchful gaze of his guard. The man was a wreck of welts, bruises, and gashes. No doubt there were broken bones beneath abused flesh.<br><br>&#x201c;Jeremiah,&#x201d; Grandmother said, &#x201c;I am disappointed in you.&#x201d;<br>At the sound of his name, the prisoner looked up at her. One of his eyes was swollen shut.<br><br>&#x201c;Captain Immerez tells me you were seen and overheard talking to some king&#x2019;s men down in Mirwellton. You were starting to give them details about us. Is this so?&#x201d;<br><br>Jeremiah did not answer, and Grandmother took this as confirmation of his guilt.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank God the captain&#x2019;s men stopped you before you ruined us,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Exposing our secrets is one of the highest acts of betrayal you could commit. Why? Why would you do such a thing?&#x201d;<br><br>Bloody saliva oozed from Jeremiah&#x2019;s mouth. Many of his teeth had been smashed during the interrogation. It took him a few moments to get any words out, and when they came, they were a wet whisper. &#x201c;I do not believe. I do not believe in the destiny of Second Empire.&#x201d;<br><br>Grandmother schooled herself to calmness, though his words made her want to cry. She&#x2019;d known Jeremiah since he was a toddler, had taught him with the other children in the ways of the empire, and she loved him as she loved all the others.<br><br>Before she could speak, he continued, &#x201c;I like...like my life in Sacoridia. Do not need empire.&#x201d;<br><br>Grandmother wanted to cover her ears at his words, but she could not deny the truth of his betrayal. It had happened to others, other descendents of Arcosia who adapted to life as Sacoridians so well they gave up on the empire, turned their backs on it. Whole sects had faded away; others had watered down bloodlines so much by marrying outside the society they were shunned. Those of the blood who turned away but did not seem likely to expose Second Empire were left alone in the hope they would return to the fold. Others, like Jeremiah, who had actively tried to betray them, were dealt with.<br><br>&#x201c;You would turn away from your heritage and all it means?&#x201d; She shook her head in disbelief and he did not deny her accusation. &#x201c;You would have destroyed us&#x2014;your family, your neighbors, your kin.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just want to farm,&#x201d; Jeremiah said. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t like leaving my land. Have peace. Nothing wrong with Sacoridia. Don&#x2019;t need empire.&#x201d;<br><br>Grandmother closed her eyes and took a deep breath. &#x201c;You know what this means, Jeremiah?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do.&#x201d;<br><br>Yes, he would know. Every one of them knew the consequences of betrayal. Second Empire had remained hidden for so long because of the doctrine of secrecy it adhered to. Punishment against transgressors was harsh to protect that secret.<br><br>&#x201c;Jeremiah,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I have no choice but to pronounce you a traitor.&#x201d;<br><br>He did not protest, he did not say a word.<br><br>&#x201c;Was anyone else involved in this heresy?&#x201d; she asked the captain.<br><br>&#x201c;The king&#x2019;s men he talked to were ambushed and killed,&#x201d; the captain replied. &#x201c;There was no one else. We were thorough in our questioning.&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded. The evidence of their thoroughness sat before her. &#x201c;You have brought this upon yourself,&#x201d; she told Jeremiah.<br><br>He bowed his head, accepting his doom.<br><br>Grandmother beckoned Lala forward and took her basket of yarn from the girl. &#x201c;Now be a good girl and go fetch my bowl. You know the one.&#x201d;<br><br>Lala nodded and trotted off.<br><br>Grandmother gazed into her basket at her yarn. There were skeins dyed deep red, indigo, and an earthy brown, and a small ball of sky blue. She chose the red, drawing out a strand about the length of her arm, and cut it with a sharp little knife that hung from her waist. She set the basket aside.<br><br>Jeremiah rocked back and forth at her feet, mumbling prayers to God. Even if he betrayed his people, at least he had not assimilated so far that he had abandoned the one true God in favor of the multitu...</p></p><h2>Wolves Eat Dogs</h2><p>In the wake of a billionaire businessman&#39;s suicide, Moscow detective Arkady Renko investigates dark secrets and international plots that may have driven the oligarch to his death, in a case that leads Renko to discover dark crimes in the area surrounding Chernobyl. By the author of December 6. 200,000 first printing.</p><p>"Why would anyone jump out a window with a saltshaker?" A good question, especially when the suicide victim is Pasha Ivanov, a Moscow physicist-turned-billionaire businessman--a "New Russian" poster boy, if ever there was one--with several homes, a leggy 20-year-old girlfriend ("the kind [of blonde] who could summon the attention of a breeze"), and every reason to be contented in his middle age. So, wonders Senior Investigator Arkady Renko, in Martin Cruz Smith's <i>Wolves Eat Dogs</i>, what provoked Ivanov to take a header from his stylish 10th-floor apartment? And how does it relate to the shaker clutched in his dead hand or the hillock of table salt found on his closet floor?<p> Renko, introduced in Smith's 1981 bestseller, <i>Gorky Park</i>, is a cop well out of sync with rapidly changing Russian society, "a difficult investigator, a holdover from the Soviet era, a man on the skids" whose determination to do more than go through the motions of criminal inquiries inevitably exasperates his superiors. Thus, when this saturnine detective declines to accept the verdict that Ivanov did himself in--who peppered that salt around the capitalist's premises, Renko still wants to know, and what about rumors of a security breach at Ivanov's apartment building?--he is exiled to the Ukrainian Zone of Exclusion, the "radioactive wasteland" surrounding Chernobyl, site of a notorious 1986 nuclear disaster and the place where, only a week after Ivanov's demise, his company's senior vice-president is found with his throat slit. There, among cynical scientists, entrepreneurial scavengers, and predators both two- and four-legged--an exclusive coterie of the rejected--Renko chews over the crimes on his plate. Unfortunately, the dosimeter that warns him of radiation exposure at Chernobyl does not also protect him from a pair of malevolent brothers, or a "damaged" woman doctor offering him mutually assured disappointment.</p><p> Smith has a keen eye for the comical quirks of modern-day Russia--its chaotic roadways, voracious appetite for post-communist luxuries, and evolving ethics ("Russians used to kill for women or power, real reasons. Now they kill for money"). And this story's bleakly beautiful Ukrainian backdrop nicely complements the desperate hope of Renko's task. Still, the greatest strength of <i>Wolves Eat Dogs</i> (Smith's fifth series installment, after <i>Havana Bay</i>) is its characters, especially Arkady Renko, who despite his lugubrious nature continues to show a heart as expansive and unfathomable as the Siberia steppe. <i>--J.

Over the next two decades, Copernicus expanded his theory through hundreds of observations, while compiling in secret a book-length manuscript that tantalized mathematicians and scientists throughout Europe. For fear of ridicule, he refused to publish.</p><p>In 1539, a young German mathematician, Georg Joachim Rheticus, drawn by rumors of a revolution to rival the religious upheaval of Martin Luther's Reformation, traveled to Poland to seek out Copernicus. Two years later, the Protestant youth took leave of his aging Catholic mentor and arranged to have Copernicus's manuscript published, in 1543, as <i>De revolutionibus orbium coelestium </i>(<i>On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres</i>)-the book that forever changed humankind's place in the universe.</p><p>In her elegant, compelling style, Dava Sobel chronicles, as nobody has, the conflicting personalities and extraordinary discoveries that shaped the Copernican Revolution. At the heart of the book is her play <i>And the Sun Stood Still</i>, imagining Rheticus's struggle to convince Copernicus to let his manuscript see the light of day. As she achieved with her bestsellers <i>Longitude</i> and <i>Galileo's Daughter</i>, Sobel expands the bounds of narration, giving us an unforgettable portrait of scientific achievement, and of the ever-present tensions between science and faith.</p></p><p><p><b>Dava Sobel </b>is the acclaimed author of the internationally bestselling titles <i>Longitude,</i> <i>Galileo's Daughter</i>, <i>The Illustrated Longitude</i>, and <i>The Planets</i>. She lives in East Hampton, New York.</p><p>&#x201c;Ms. Sobel is an elegant stylist, a riveting and efficient storyteller, a writer who can bring the dustiest of subjects to full-blooded life -- poignant, in the case of Galileo; cautious but also loving, loyal and feisty in the case of Copernicus.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Katherine Bouton, New York Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Lively, inventive...a masterly specimen of close-range cultural history. Ms. Sobel certainly brings Copernicus to life, perhaps better than any other author. Ms. Sobel presents a thoroughly researched and eminently readable account of a major scientist who celebrated the sun yet lurks in the shadows.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;Dava Sobel describes [Copernicus's] life and his legacy in her enjoyable "A More Perfect Heaven"...[A] delightful immersion into tumultuous times...All this history is just the background for the heart of Sobel's book: the meeting of the aged Copernicus with the young German mathematician Georg Joachim Rheticus, who had heard of Copernicus's ideas and traveled to Poland for a first-hand account. Rheticus stayed, helped Copernicus finish his treatise and, four years later, shepherded it through its first printing...We'll never know precisely how Rheticus convinced Copernicus to finally set it all in print, but, as Sobel shows, we certainly owe him gratitude, for these manuscripts are treasures of our world, tracing our first steps out into an understandable cosmos.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Mike Brown, Washington Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;The new work by science writer Dava Sobel, author of "Longitude" (1995) and "<b>Galileo</b>'s Daughter" (2000) is half-narrative, half-drama -- and it's all enthralling, all illuminating. As in her previous bestselling books, Sobel... turns the history of science into a great story filled with fascinating characters, excruciating near-misses and the sudden splendor of the new discovery...A More Perfect Heaven is the story of how a young German mathematician named Rhetiucs finally persuaded Copernicus to publish his outlandish theory. Their relationship is the energizing spark of Sobel's book...Her two-act play "And the Sun Stood Still" is included in A More Perfect Heaven, and it puts flesh on the long-dissolved bones of these historical figures...Sobel, who was writer-in-residence at the U. of C. in 2006, writes with a calm authority and a deep knowledge that never tip into condescension to the lay reader. The haunting final paragraph of this beautiful book, combining science and a sort of poetic awe, is emblematic of her work as a whole.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Julia Keller, Chicago Tribune</i></p><p>&#x201c;Like Rumpelstiltskin, Dava Sobel seems able to spin gold out of straw. She has made best-sellers out of two unlikely subjects: the history of longitude and the life of Galileo's daughter...Sobel goes beyond conjecture, which a historian may not, and instead takes conjecture in hand as a playwright can. The center of her book is a fictional two-act play -- "And the Sun Stood Still"...It's absorbing and very well-written, and dramatically very effective. And very effective historically, too...The gripe most of us history lovers have with historical fiction is that it imagines too much, reaches too far. Sobel's dramatization gives immediacy to an historical account made up, as much of history is, by peripheral documents -- rent transactions, correspondence about local coin values, written in the formalistic and impersonal style of the day...Sobel will have another of her improbable best-sellers, I predict, in this story of how Copernicus went to press -- a further example of how an author's wit, intelligence, good grace and imagination can find gold in the most unlikely places.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>David Walton, Kansas City Star</i></p><p>&#x201c;The wonderful detail and eloquent writing that Sobel demonstrated in her best-selling <i>Longitude</i> and <i>Galileo's Daughter</i> carry the reader along here too. Given what she has chosen to include, the book is first rate...<i>A More Perfect Heaven</i> is a charming and accurate book...[T]his carefully constructed biography leaves space for those of us probing the origins of heliocentrism to defend our speculations.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Owen Gingerich, Nature</i></p><p>&#x201c;Sobel characteristically gives us the man in full...[she] tells her story fluently.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Financial Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;However readers respond to Sobel's unorthodox addition, her account of Copernicus' life nicely balances personal details and such historical forces that knocked Copernicus around as the Reformation and the Teutonic Knights. Sobel's latest assiduously researched, humanistic biography may prove irresistible to history-of-science fans.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;Delivered with her usual stylistic grace (and here, a touch of astrological whimsy), Sobel's gamble largely succeeds in bringing Copernicus and his intellectually and religiously tumultuous time alive.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;A book on science and personality that should intrigue us all.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;A liquid entertainment of choice passages on the thoughts and deeds of Copernicus.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;A refreshingly fast-paced account of the life of Nicolaus Copernicus. &#x2018;A More Perfect Heaven' does a good job of giving the flavor of life in Reformation-era Europe...an excellent book.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Economist</i></p><p>&#x201c;As a colorful, singular history, Sobel's narrative doesn't disappoint. But her most surprising and satisfying turn is the two act play, &#x2018;And the Sun Stood Still'&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Men's Journal</i></p></p><h2>The Beige Man (An Irene Huss Investigation)</h2><p><b>A speeding BMW leaves a dead pedestrian in its wake and leads police to the corpse of a young girl in a cellar.

She was born in G�teborg, Sweden, where she now lives with her husband and daughter.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>The new moon and the stars shone as brightly as diamonds in the blue-black January sky. Their reflection glittered in the rime-frost covering Goteb�rg. The car&#x2019;s external thermometer was already showing minus fifteen degrees. The temperature would probably drop even further during the night. The harsh cold had managed to maintain its iron grip on the country for almost two weeks now, although no snow had yet fallen in the west of Sweden.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Officer Stefan Eriksson was yawning in the pleasant warmth of the patrol car. The engine was idling, and he didn&#x2019;t give a thought to any environmental concerns. When the weather was like this, the important thing was not to let the icy cold come creeping in. He stole a glance at the brightly lit hatch of the kiosk that served food. Petr�n, his colleague, was at the front of the queue and was just paying. A cup of hot coffee and<br>a cheeseburger with all the extras would definitely hit the spot right now, an hour before the end of their shift. A loud rumble from Eriksson&#x2019;s stomach confirmed that it was high time he got something inside him. Neither of them had eaten since they came on duty at four o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon&#x2014;not because the evening had been unusually busy, but because they had been called to deal with a fight at a pizzeria in the Old Town just as they were due to go back to the station for their meal break.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without bothering to rush, they had headed north to the address they had been given. The arrival of the patrol car had had a calming effect on the three guys involved in the fight, and Eriksson and Petr�n had soon had the situation under control. Nobody wanted to make a formal complaint; suddenly all three men were in total agreement that they had been engaged in nothing more than a lively discussion. The fact that one of them had a broken nose and was bleeding so profusely he had to be taken to �stra Hospital by ambulance was merely a regrettable accident. As were the red marks on the faces of the other two. All three of them would be sporting impressive bruises in various shades of blue and purple in a few hours. Since no one wanted the police to take any further action, Eriksson and Petr�n left the pizzeria as soon as the man with the broken nose had been taken away. A report on the incident would be sufficient.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that the officers had agreed they weren&#x2019;t in the mood for pizza, so they had driven to the kiosk on Delsj�v�gen. It was easy to park there, and the fast food was supposed to be pretty good&#x2014;at least according to Petr�n. He was a single guy, and more or less lived off that kind of stuff.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eriksson was roused from his thoughts as the radio burst into life:<br><br><i>Calling all cars: a metallic silver BMW 630 was stolen in<br>Stampen a few minutes ago. The owner saw two young men<br>jump into the car and drive off along Sk�negatan heading<br>toward Liseberg. Both were wearing dark woolen hats and<br>dark clothing. The witness thought they were of average<br>height, slight build. The registration number of the car is . . .</i><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sk�negatan, heading toward Liseberg. That meant they would be driving past the police station. The nerve of the bastards, Eriksson thought.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Petr�n hurried toward the car with a bag of cheeseburgers in one hand and their cups of coffee in the other. He was wearing gloves, and it looked like a pretty risky balancing act; Eriksson reached across and opened the passenger door for his&nbsp; colleague. Petr�n slid his hip into the car and bent his knee, then suddenly stopped with one foot on the floor of the car and the other on the tarmac.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eriksson could feel the cold quickly spreading through the warm interior, and said crossly, &#x201c;Get your ass in here before . . .&#x201d; He broke off in the middle of the sentence and sat there open-mouthed. A car was speeding toward them along Delsj�v�gen, its high beams on and its engine racing. As the car passed beneath a street lamp just a few meters away, Eriksson registered the fact that it was light-colored, probably silver&#x2014;definitely a large BMW. It skidded sharply as the driver put his foot down and slid past the patrol car with screeching tires.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Jesus Christ, it&#x2019;s the stolen BMW!&#x201d; Eriksson shouted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What stolen BMW?&#x201d; Petr�n asked as he carefully slid into the passenger seat.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The one we had a call about just now! Get on the radio and tell them we&#x2019;re after the bastard!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What do you mean, can&#x2019;t?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hands full.&#x201d; Petr�n held up the coffee cups and the bag by way of explanation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;For Christ&#x2019;s sake, just get rid of it!&#x201d; Eriksson roared.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without a word, Petr�n pushed the button to open the window with his right elbow. The discreet hum as the window slid down was drowned out by the sound of the patrol car&#x2019;s tires as they spun on the tarmac. Without further ado, Petr�n threw out their coffee and burgers, and as the window began to close, he grabbed the microphone and called control.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;S-H-O eleven zero one by the kiosk on Delsj�v�gen. The stolen BMW has just driven past us heading in the direction of K�lltorp, traveling at high speed. In pursuit. Over.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Thank you, eleven zero one. I&#x2019;ll call for assistance from other patrols. Thirteen zero four is on the way from �stra Hospital and can cut across from the opposite direction. Backup is on the way.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eriksson drove as fast as he dared. He could see the rear lights of the BMW disappearing in the direction of Swedish Television&#x2019;s brightly lit, box-shaped building. He put his foot down hard, and suddenly the lights in front of him glowed as brightly as two red fireworks. The BMW was swerving all over the place and looked as if it might actually go off the road.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two police officers saw something fly up in the air, then land to one side of the car. Whatever it was, it lay motionless on the tarmac next to the sidewalk. When the driver had regained control, the BMW immediately took off again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The patrol car slowed down and stopped.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Shit! It&#x2019;s a person! Call it in!&#x201d; Eriksson shouted, frantic.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Petr�n once again seized the microphone with a steady hand and spoke to control in a voice that was significantly less steady, &#x201c;Eleven zero one here. The BMW has hit a pedestrian outside Swedish Television. Send an ambulance and backup. We need to remain at the scene. Over.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Understood. We&#x2019;ll send an ambulance and another patrol. Other teams will continue to pursue the BMW.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stefan Eriksson was already out of the car and didn&#x2019;t hear the response. He reached the motionless body in a few long strides.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a lot of blood, and the dark pool was growing with terrifying speed. No human being could lose this much blood and survive. Deep down, Eriksson knew this person was already dead, but he cautiously moved closer to the victim&#x2019;s head to check for a carotid pulse. He changed his mind, however, when he saw the state of the head. In order for a person to survive, the brain needs to be inside the skull. This brain wasn&#x2019;t.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eriksson had seen many traffic accident casualties during his years of service, but this one looked particularly gruesome. Because the car had been traveling so fast, the victim&#x2019;s unprotected limbs and head had been crushed with immense force. It wouldn&#x2019;t be easy to identify this person, he thought. He could hear the sound of approaching sirens in the distance. He glanced over his shoulder and saw his colleague setting out the reflective plastic screens marked <i>police</i>. The blue flashing lights of the patrol car cast an eerie glow over the scene of the accident. A few cars had pulled up, but Petr�n was managing to keep the occupants away.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The body was lying on its back, with both legs twisted in an unnatural position. The lower half of the left leg appeared to have snapped off completely, given the way it was lying in relation to the thighbone. The left arm was flung straight out to the side, but the hand was missing. When Eriksson looked around, he spotted a lump on the sidewalk that was probably the severed hand. The clothing suggested the victim was male. He was wearing some kind of black or dark blue tracksuit. His right hand lay limply on his chest. Somehow the mangled body gave an impression of peace, as if the man had realized he was going to die and had instinctively placed his hand upon his heart to feel its final beat.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second patrol car arrived, closely followed by the ambulance. Illuminated by the flashing blue lights, something shone faintly next to the dead man&#x2019;s hand, just above the heart. Eriksson was careful to avoid stepping in the blood as he moved closer to take a look.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first his brain refused to accept what he was seeing. He recognized it instantly because he had seen it countless times before. When Petr�n and their newly arrived colleagues came over, Eriksson pointed at the victim&#x2019;s chest with a shaking hand.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few minutes after the hit-and-run outside the TV studios, a report came in from someone who had been standing at the Lilla Torp tram stop. According to the caller, a car had turned onto T�pelsgatan and continued toward the Delsj� area at high speed. The witness thought the windshield was broken because he had seen a young man hanging out of the window on the passenger side, apparently shouting directions to the<br>driver.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several patrol cars had been dispatched immediately to follow up on this information. There were many, many smaller roads leading off the main route up toward the recreation and bathing area at Delsj�, and the holiday village had to be taken into account, with its countless minor roads and parking lots. There was also a chance that the car thieves had turned onto one of the bridle paths. It wouldn&#x2019;t be too difficult to ride a car among the trees in the darkness. The deciduous trees were bare in January, but there were dense thickets of conifers along both sides of the road.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After only ten minutes, a patrol found the abandoned BMW; the glow of the fire through the trees led them straight to it. The thieves had torched the car before taking off. The officers managed to put out the flames using the fire extinguisher in their car; the damage to the interior of the BMW was not severe, but would of course hamper the search for any traces of the perpetrators. The windshield was still in place and holding together, but had shattered into milky opaqueness. The car was parked in front of a sturdy barrier.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other patrol cars were quickly called to the scene, and officers began searching the surrounding area, the beams of their flashlights flickering among the trees. The ground was very hilly and the dense undergrowth difficult to penetrate. On one side the ground fell away steeply toward a stream, while on the other it climbed sharply up Alfred G�rdes path, leading to Delsj� swimming area.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a boarded-up brick building a few dozen meters down the slope. It wasn&#x2019;t very big, and had probably been used to store tools. Instead of windows and doors, all the openings were covered with thick hardboard. The whole place was in a state of advanced decay. It was probably still standing only because it hadn&#x2019;t yet decided in which direction to collapse. Several police officers surrounded the building, trying to move as quietly as possible. They were breathing hard, their breath misty in the cold night air. The atmosphere was tense because they had no idea whether the car thieves were armed. One officer crept forward to a damaged sheet of hardboard partly covering the doorway. She pressed her back against the wall and drew her gun. A colleague followed her, a crowbar in his hand.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;This building is surrounded!&#x201d; an officer shouted from the other side. &#x201c;You might as well give up right now! Come out with your hands up!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There wasn&#x2019;t a sound from inside the derelict structure. The cold crackled in the branches of the trees, and the frozen grass crunched whenever one of the officers changed position. Apart from that, there was silence in the darkness. The female officer by the door nodded to her colleague, who quickly forced the crowbar under the broken board. He leaned on the shaft with all his strength and pushed as hard as he could. With a creak, the board came away and fell to the ground. The officer quickly positioned himself by the wall on the other side of the door and switched on his flashlight. Keeping his head well back, he directed the beam through the opening, moving it across the compact darkness of the interior.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No movement. Nothing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while both officers slipped cautiously inside. A few tense seconds later came the sound of surprised exclamations, mixed with sniggering and slightly hysterical laughter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing to worry about&#x2014;it&#x2019;s just some animal!&#x201d; shouted the male officer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s coming out!&#x201d; his colleague added.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A small shape came waddling out through the doorway, blinking in confusion in the bright light. It raised it snout toward the cold, starry sky and sniffed suspiciously. This time, the odd burst of laughter came from the officers standing outside, and they turned away their flashlights. It was way too cold for a badger to be out and about, so it simply turned around and lumbered back inside. It almost collided with the two officers in the doorway; they stepped aside and allowed the sleepy animal to return to its winter bed, then they came out and assured everyone that there were no human beings in the building.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, a van arrived and parked up on the road. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The dogs are here,&#x201d; the female officer stated.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Great. Searching in the dark is impossible. They could be anywhere in the forest,&#x201d; her colleague said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sound of excited barking could be heard as soon as the back door of the van was opened and the dogs realized it was time to work.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;nbs...</p><h2>Holy the Firm</h2><p>Demonstrates the ways in which mental visualization may be employed to solve health and weight, family, and business problems as well as to improve love relationships and expand one&#39;s creative potential</p><p><p>Annie Dillard has written twelve books,including in nonfiction <em>For the Time Being, Teaching a Stone to Talk, Holy the Firm</em>, and <em>Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</em>.

But now, in a work of unprecedented scope and range, a distinguished linguist challenges that deceptive hegemony, showing with piquant detail and lively anecdote that no standards of correctness have ever really contained the surging energy of English, in all it multiform varieties. From the syntactical inventiveness of tenth-century Norse invaders to the lexical ecumenism of twenty-first-century Tex-Mex ranch hands, Crystal traces the diverse and unpredictable influences that have shaped English into an unruly family of dialects, creoles, and patois. To be sure, Crystal acknowledges the emergence during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries of a prestigious standard version of English. Yet he shows in instance after instance that the tempests of linguistic change have often overwhelmed the custodians of the King's English, compelling them to accommodate forces they could not control. And though he never loses his focus on language, Crystal allows some of its more colorful users--including Chaucer, Shakespeare, Samuel Johnson, and Thomas Jefferson--to bring their personalities and voices into the chronicle. Accessible to the nonspecialist, Crystal's rich chronicle still presses deeply enough into key episodes (the Great Vowel Shift and the Elizabethan effervescence, for instance) to entice even casual readers into the more scholarly sources listed at the end of the book.

Lower back pain alone accounts for more than $50 billion of lost work time and worker&#x2019;s compensation claims annually. And let&#x2019;s consider the fact that there are 600,000 knee replacement surgeries performed each year in the United States, and sadly, 20 percent of those patients end up with chronic pain after surgery.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The normal &#x201c;solutions&#x201d; we&#x2019;ve been taught involve seeking out more doctors, surgeries, injections, and medications, all of which have a place in healing. But when it comes to chronic pain, conventional medicine isn&#x2019;t getting the job done. So what can we do?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>The Tapping Solution for Pain Relief, </i>which builds on the information contained in the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>The Tapping Solution, </i>Nick Ortner presents a startling alternative<i>. </i>He lays out a step-by-step plan that teaches people how to use tapping, or EFT (emotional freedom techniques), to reduce or eliminate chronic pain. Looking at the scientific research surrounding pain, stress, and tapping, he opens readers eyes to just how powerful tapping can be, and then outlines tips and techniques to address pain in both the short and long term.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nick guides readers on a journey that begins on the surface&#x2014;tapping to address the pain itself&#x2014;and moves to the deeper issues that often affect pain. With easy-to-follow tapping scripts and exercises to guide readers into their pasts, Nick helps them heal the emotional pain and underlying beliefs that often keep people stuck. He also addresses topics that many people don&#x2019;t know are associated with chronic pain, such as:<br><ul><li>Releasing the past</li><li>Creating personal boundaries</li><li>Dealing with toxic relationships</li><li>Clearing resistance to change</li><li>Understanding the power of a diagnosis</li><li>Working through anger</li></ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many different ways the brain and body can create, increase, and prolong pain. In these pages, Nick helps readers understand what is causing their pain and provides them with the tools to achieve complete and lasting pain relief. But it&#x2019;s about more than just pain relief; it&#x2019;s about empowering readers to take back their bodies, so they can live the life they most desire.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Nick Ortner is a&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;best-selling author and the creator and executive producer of the hit documentary film&nbsp;<i>The Tapping Solution.</i>&nbsp;He has also produced the annual worldwide online event, the Tapping World Summit, which has been attended by over 1,000,000 people. Ortner is a dynamic speaker, presenting breakthrough live tapping sessions around the world. He lives in Newtown, Connecticut.

Dyer, author of Wishes Fulfilled I believe Nick Ortner&#39;s teachings are easy to use and practical but work like magic.

It&#39;s a winner. -- Dr Christiane Northrup, author of Women&#39;s Bodies, Women&#39;s Wisdom If you&#39;re living with chronic pain and all the stress and exhaustion it brings, turn to Nick Ortner.

In it, the collision of the American &#34;New Barbarians&#34; and the European &#34;Old World&#34; provides much comic fodder for Mark Twain--and a remarkably perceptive lens on the human condition. Gleefully skewering the ethos of American tourism in Europe, Twain&#39;s lively satire ultimately reveals just what it is that defines cultural identity. As Twain himself points out, &#34;Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one&#39;s lifetime.&#34; And Jane Jacobs observes in her Introduction, &#34;If the reader is American, he may also find himself on a tour of his own psyche.&#34;</p><h2>The History: Herodotus</h2><p>David Grene, one of the best known translators of the Greek classics, splendidly captures the peculiar quality of Herodotus, the father of history.<br><br>Here is the historian, investigating and judging what he has seen, heard, and read, and seeking out the true causes and consequences of the great deeds of the past. In his <i>History</i>, the war between the Greeks and Persians, the origins of their enmity, and all the more general features of the civilizations of the world of his day are seen as a unity and expressed as the vision of one man who as a child lived through the last of the great acts in this universal drama.<br><br>In Grene's remarkable translation and commentary, we see the historian as a storyteller, combining through his own narration the skeletal "historical" facts and the imaginative reality toward which his story reaches. Herodotus emerges in all his charm and complexity as a writer and the first historian in the Western tradition, perhaps unique in the way he has seen the interrelation of fact and fantasy.<br><br>"Reading Herodotus in English has never been so much fun. . . . Herodotus crowds his fresco-like pages with all shades of humanity. Whether Herodotus's view is 'tragic,' mythical, or merely common sense, it provided him with a moral salt with which the diversity of mankind could be savored. And savor it we do in David Grene's translation."&#x2014;Thomas D'Evelyn, <i>Christian Science Monitor</i><br><br>"Grene's work is a monument to what translation intends, and to what it is hungry to accomplish. . . . Herodotus gives more sheer pleasure than almost any other writer."&#x2014;Peter Levi, <i>New York Times Book Review<br><br></i></p><p>Herodotus of Halicarnassus was born about 484 B.C. and died some 60 years later. He traveled over much of the known ancient world, making trips to places such as southern Italy, lower Egypt, and the Caucasus. His great <i>History</i>, the first major prose work in world literature, is an account of his world at the time of the Persian Wars. The book, here ably translated by University of Chicago scholar David Grene, earned Herodotus the epithet "The Father of History" in ancient times. He distinguishes between the things seen with his own eyes and those of which he had only heard. But he was often too credulous of things told to him by his peers along the way, for which reason his younger contemporary Thucydides called him "The Father of Lies." Renowned in his own time for his humanity and wide-ranging curiosity, Herodotus shows an insatiable appetite for both useful information and a good yarn, and <i>The History</i> is a starting point for any student of the past.David Grene, one of the Best known translators of the Greek classics, captures for the first time the peculiar quality of Herodotus, the father of history. Here is the historian, investigating and judging what he has seen, heard, and read, and seeking out the true causes and consequences of the great deeds of the past.</p><h2>What Lips My Lips Have Kissed: The Loves and Love Poems of Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2><p>A noted biographer and poet illuminates the unique woman who wrote the greatest American love poetry of the twentieth century<br><br>This is the story of a rare sort of American genius, who grew up in grinding poverty in Camden, Maine. Nothing could save the sensitive child but her talent for words, music and drama, and an inexorable desire to be loved. When she was twenty, her poetry would make her famous; at thirty she would be loved by readers the world over.<br><br>Edna St. Vincent Millay was widely considered to be the most seductive woman of her age. Few men could resist her, and many women also fell under her spell. From the publication of her first poems until the scandal over <i>Fatal Interview</i> twenty years later, gossip about the poet's liberated lifestyle prompted speculation about who might be the real subject of her verses.<br>Using letters, diaries and journals of the poet and her lovers that have only recently become available, Daniel Mark Epstein tells the astonishing story of the life, dedicated to art and love, that inspired the sublime lyrics of Edna St. Vincent Millay.<br></p><p>Poet, playwright, and translator Daniel Mark Epstein certainly has the right background to understand and evaluate poet, playwright, and translator Edna St. Vincent Millay (1892-1950)--though Millay didn't write biographies. Readers of Epstein's <i>Sister Aimee</i> and <i>Nat King Cole</i> will recognize the intense personal engagement the author brings to his task. He's not afraid to express an almost physical fascination for his subjects, which is especially appropriate for the flamboyant Millay, who insisted on the right to take as many lovers as she pleased and to write about them in some of the greatest erotic poetry in American verse. Epstein focuses on that poetry, deciphering the affairs that fueled it and elucidating the boldly iconoclastic, almost cynical acceptance of love's fleeting nature that informs it. (Of the last sonnet in <i>A Few Figs from Thistles</i>, with its notorious putdown, "I shall forget you presently, my dear / So make the most of this, your little day," he remarks: "For a woman, not yet thirty, to compose and market such a poem... was a scandal, an alarm, and a red flag to censors.") While the Edna St. Vincent Millay who emerges in Nancy Milford's <i>Savage Beauty</i> is indelibly shaped by her upbringing, particularly her relationship with her mother and sisters, Epstein's Millay is a self-created goddess of love and literature. It's fascinating to compare these two biographies, published nearly simultaneously and each with considerable merits. Milford's lengthy book, the product of three decades of research, is lavish with details and comprehensive in scope. Epstein's more selective work excels in cogent summaries and forcefully stated opinions. Either book will satisfy readers with an interest in Millay or American literature; really passionate aficionados of the art of biography will want to read both. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Daniel Mark Epstein is an award-winning essayist, poet, playwright, translator, biographer, and musician. He's won the Prix de Rome, a Guggenheim fellowship, and been anthologized in several collections of essays and poetry. His books include biographies of Aimee Semple, Nat King Cole, and seven volumes of poetry.

Among the biggest: <em>How did</em> Homo sapiens <em>(or</em> Homo sapiens sapiens <em>, if you&#x2019;re feeling especially wise today) evolve from an unexceptional savannah-dwelling primate to become the dominant force on the planet, emerging as the lone survivor out of six distinct, competing hominid species?</em> He also has some answers, and they&#x2019;re not what you&#x2019;d expect. Tackling evolutionary concepts from a historian&#x2019;s perspective, <em>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</em>, describes human development through a framework of three not-necessarily-orthodox &#x201c;Revolutions&#x201d;: the Cognitive, the Agricultural, and the Scientific. His ideas are interesting and often amusing: <em>Why have humans managed to build astonishingly large populations when other primate groups top out at 150 individuals?</em> Because our talent for gossip allows us to build networks in societies too large for personal relationships between everyone, and our universally accepted &#x201c;imagined realities&#x201d;--such as money, religion, and Limited Liability Corporations&#x2014;keep us in line. <em>Who cultivated whom, humans or wheat?</em>. Wheat. Though the concepts are unusual and sometimes heavy (as is the book, literally) Harari&#x2019;s deft prose and wry, subversive humor make quick work of material prone to academic tedium. He&#x2019;s written a book of popular nonfiction (it was a bestseller overseas, no doubt in part because his conclusions draw controversy) landing somewhere in the middle of a Venn diagram of genetics, sociology, and history. Throughout, Harari returns frequently to another question: <em>Does all this progress make us happier, our lives easier?</em> The answer might disappoint you. --<em>Jon Foro</em></p><p>One hundred thousand years ago, at least six human species inhabited the earth. Today there is just one. Us. <em>Homo sapiens</em>. How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations, and human rights; to trust money, books, and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables, and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? </p><p>In <em>Sapiens</em>, Professor Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical&#x2014;and sometimes devastating&#x2014;breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural, and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology, and economics, and incorporating full-color illustrations throughout the text, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behavior from the legacy of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come? </p><p>Bold, wide-ranging, and provocative, <em>Sapiens</em> integrates history and science to challenge everything we thought we knew about being human: our thoughts, our actions, our heritage...and our future.</p></p><h2>SuperBetter: A Revolutionary Approach to Getting Stronger, Happier, Braver and More Resilient--Powered by the Science of Games</h2><p><b><b>An innovative guide to living gamefully, based on the program that has already helped nearly half a million people achieve remarkable personal growth</b><br></b><br>In 2009, internationally renowned game designer Jane McGonigal suffered a severe concussion. Unable to think clearly or work or even get out of bed, she became anxious and depressed, even suicidal. But rather than let herself sink further, she decided to get better by doing what she does best: she turned her recovery process into a resilience-building game. What started as a simple motivational exercise quickly became a set of rules for &#x201c;post-traumatic growth&#x201d; that she shared on her blog. These rules led to a digital game and a major research study with the National Institutes of Health. Today nearly half a million people have played SuperBetter to get stronger, happier, and healthier.<br><br>But the life-changing ideas behind SuperBetter<i> </i>are much bigger than just one game. In this book, McGonigal reveals a decade&#x2019;s worth of scientific research into the ways all games&#x2014;including videogames, sports, and puzzles&#x2014;change how we respond to stress, challenge, and pain. She explains how we can cultivate new powers of recovery and resilience in everyday life simply by adopting a more &#x201c;gameful&#x201d; mind-set. Being gameful means bringing the same psychological strengths we naturally display when we play games&#x2014;such as optimism, creativity, courage, and determination&#x2014;to real-world goals.<br><p>Drawing on hundreds of studies, McGonigal shows that getting superbetter is as simple as tapping into the three core psychological strengths that games help you build:</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>Your ability to control your attention,</b> and therefore your thoughts and feelings <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>Your power to turn anyone into a potential ally,</b> and to strengthen your existing relationships <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>Your natural capacity to motivate yourself and super-charge your heroic qualities,</b> like willpower, compassion, and determination <br><br><p><i>SuperBetter</i> contains nearly 100 playful challenges anyone can undertake in order to build these gameful strengths. It includes stories and data from people who have used the SuperBetter method to get stronger in the face of illness, injury, and other major setbacks, as well as to achieve goals like losing weight, running a marathon, and finding a new job.<br><br>As inspiring as it is down to earth, and grounded in rigorous research, <i>SuperBetter</i> is a proven game plan for a better life. You&#x2019;ll never say that something is &#x201c;just a game&#x201d; again.</p></p><p><b>Jane McGonigal, PhD,</b> is a senior researcher at the Institute for the Future and the author of&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestseller&nbsp;<i>Reality Is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World</i>. Her work has been featured in&nbsp;<i>The Economist</i>,&nbsp;<i>Wired</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>&nbsp;and on MTV, CNN, and NPR. She has been called one of the top ten innovators to watch (<i>BusinessWeek</i>), one of the one hundred most creative people in business (<i>Fast Company</i>), and one of the fifty most important people in the gaming industry (<i>Game Developers Magazine</i>). Her TED talks on games have been viewed more than ten million times.<p></p><p>Before You Play, Here&#x2019;s What You Need to Know</p><p>The SuperBetter method is designed to make you stronger, happier, braver, and more resilient.</p><p>It&#x2019;s based on the science of games&#x2014;and there&#x2019;s <i>a lot</i> of evidence that it works.</p><p>A<b> randomized, controlled study conducted by the University of Pennsylvania</b> found that playing SuperBetter for thirty days significantly reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety and increases optimism, social support, and players&#x2019; belief in their own ability to succeed and achieve their goals. The study also found that people who followed the SuperBetter rules for one month were significantly happier and more satisfied with their lives.</p><p>A <b>clinical trial funded by the National Institutes of Health</b> and conducted at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and Cincinnati Children&#x2019;s Hospital found that the SuperBetter method improves mood, decreases anxiety and suffering, and strengthens family relationships during rehabilitation and recovery.</p><p>Meanwhile, <b>data collected from more than 400,000 SuperBetter players</b> has helped me improve the method, to make it easier to learn and more fun to use in everyday life.</p><p>Every single day for the past five years I&#x2019;ve heard from someone who says that the SuperBetter method has changed their life. It is my greatest hope that SuperBetter will help<i> you</i> tackle your toughest challenges, and pursue your biggest dreams, with more courage, creativity, optimism, and support.</p><p>Please remember, the SuperBetter method is <i>not</i> a substitute for medical advice or treatment. Many successful SuperBetter players&#x2014;including a majority of participants in the University of Pennsylvania study and all the participants in the clinical trial&#x2014;followed the SuperBetter method alongside some form of continuing counseling, medication, or rehabilitation, or with a doctor&#x2019;s supervision.<i> The SuperBetter method is NOT an alternative to therapy, counseling, ongoing medical treatment, or medication&#x2014;nor is any game recommended or discussed in this book.</i></p><p>Now that you know&#x2014;let&#x2019;s play!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Introduction</p><p>You are stronger than you know.</p><p>You are surrounded by potential allies.</p><p>You are the hero of your own story.</p><p>These three qualities are all it takes to become happier, braver, and more resilient in the face of any challenge.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s the good news: You already have these qualities within you. You don&#x2019;t have to change a thing. You are <i>already</i> more powerful than you realize.</p><p>You have the ability to control your attention&#x2014;and therefore your thoughts and feelings.</p><p>You have the strength to find support in the most unexpected places, and deepen your existing relationships.</p><p>You have a natural capacity to motivate yourself and supercharge your heroic qualities, like willpower, compassion, and determination.</p><p>This book will help you understand the powers you already have&#x2014;and show you that accessing these powers is <i>as easy as playing a game</i>.</p><p>And yet this book is not about playing games&#x2014;at least, not exactly. It&#x2019;s about learning <i>how to be</i> <i>gameful</i> in the face of extreme stress and personal challenge.</p><p>Being gameful means bringing the psychological strengths you naturally display when you play games&#x2014;such as optimism, creativity, courage, and determination&#x2014;to your real life. It means having the curiosity and openness to play with different strategies to discover what works best. It means building up the resilience to tackle tougher and tougher challenges with greater and greater success.</p><p>The best way I know to explain what it means to be gameful&#x2014;and how being gameful can make you stronger, happier, and braver&#x2014;is to tell you a story. It&#x2019;s the story of how I invented the SuperBetter method&#x2014;and the life-threatening challenge I had to overcome to be able to write this book.</p><p>In the summer of 2009, I hit my head and got a concussion. It didn&#x2019;t heal properly, and after thirty days I still had constant headaches, nausea, and vertigo. I couldn&#x2019;t read or write for more than a few minutes at a time. I had trouble remembering things. Most days I felt too sick to get out of bed. I was in a total mental fog. These symptoms left me more anxious and depressed than I had ever been in my life.</p><p>I had trouble communicating clearly to friends and family exactly what I was going through. I thought if I could write something down, it would help. I struggled and struggled to put together words that made sense, and this is what I came up with:</p><p>Everything is hard.</p><p>The iron fist is pushing against my thoughts.</p><p>My whole brain feels vacuum pressurized.</p><p>If I can&#x2019;t think who am I?</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no real treatment for postconcussion syndrome. You just rest as much as you can and hope for the best. I was told I might not feel better for months or even a year or longer.</p><p>There was one thing I could do to try to heal faster. My doctor told me I should avoid everything that triggered my symptoms. That meant no reading, no writing, no running, no video games, no work, no email, no alcohol, and no caffeine. I joked to my doctor at the time: &#x201c;In other words, no reason to live.&#x201d;</p><p>There was quite a bit of truth in that joke. I didn&#x2019;t know it then, but suicidal ideation is very common with traumatic brain injuries&#x2014;even mild ones like mine.1 It happens to one in three, and it happened to me. My brain started telling me: <i>Jane, you want to die.</i> It said, <i>You&#x2019;re never going to get better. The pain will never end. You&#x2019;ll be a burden to your husband.</i></p><p>These voices became so persistent and so persuasive that I started to legitimately fear for my life.</p><p>And then something happened. I had one crystal-clear thought that changed everything. Thirty-four days after I hit my head&#x2014;and I will never forget this moment&#x2014;I said to myself, <i>I am either going to kill myself, or I&#x2019;m going to turn this into a game.</i></p><p>Why a game? By the time I hit my head in 2009, I&#x2019;d been researching the psychology of games for nearly a decade. In fact, I was the first person in the world to earn a Ph.D. studying the psychological strengths of gamers and how those strengths can translate to real-world problem solving. I knew from my years of research at the University of California at Berkeley that when we play a game, we tackle tough challenges with more creativity, more determination, and more optimism. We&#x2019;re also more likely to reach out to others for help. And I wanted to bring these gameful traits to my real-life challenge.</p><p>So I created a simple recovery game called &#x201c;Jane the Concussion Slayer.&#x201d; This became my new <i>secret identity</i>, a way to start feeling heroic and determined instead of hopeless.</p><p>The first thing I did as the concussion slayer was to call my twin sister, Kelly, and tell her, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m playing a game to heal my brain, and I want you to play with me.&#x201d; This was an easy way to ask for help. She became my first <i>ally</i> in the game. My husband, Kiyash, joined next.</p><p>Together we identified and battled the <i>bad guys. </i>These were anything that could trigger my symptoms and therefore slow down the healing process&#x2014;things like bright lights and crowded spaces.</p><p>We also collected and activated <i>power-ups. </i>These were anything I could do on even my worst day to feel just a little bit good or happy or powerful. Some of my favorite power-ups were cuddling my Shetland sheepdog for five minutes, eating walnuts (good for my brain), and walking around the block twice with my husband.</p><p>The game was that simple: adopt a secret identity, recruit allies, battle the bad guys, and activate power-ups. But even with a game so simple, within just a couple days of starting to play, that fog of depression and anxiety went away. It just vanished. It felt like a miracle to me. It <i>wasn&#x2019;t</i> a miracle cure for the headaches or the cognitive symptoms&#x2014;they lasted more than a year, and it was the hardest year of my life by far. But even when I still had the symptoms, even while I was still in pain, <i>I stopped suffering</i>. I felt more in control of my own destiny. My friends and family knew exactly how to help and support me. And I started to see myself as a much stronger person.</p><p>What happened next with the game surprised me. After a few months, I put up a blog post and a short video online explaining how to play. Not everybody has a concussion, and not everyone wants to be &#x201c;the slayer,&#x201d; so I renamed the game <i>SuperBetter</i>.</p><p>Why SuperBetter? Everyone had told me to &#x201c;get better soon&#x201d; while I was recovering from the concussion, but I didn&#x2019;t want just to get better, as in back to normal. I wanted to get <i>super</i>better: happier and healthier than I&#x2019;d been before the injury.</p><p>Soon I started hearing from people all over the world who were adopting their own secret identities, recruiting their own allies, and fighting their own bad guys. They were getting &#x201c;superbetter&#x201d; at facing challenges like depression and anxiety, surgery and chronic pain, migraines and Crohn&#x2019;s disease, healing a broken heart and finding a job after years of unemployment. People were even playing it for extremely serious, even terminal diagnoses, like stage-five cancer and Lou Gehrig&#x2019;s disease (ALS). And I could tell from their messages and their videos that the game was helping them in the same ways that it helped me.</p><p>These players talked about feeling stronger and braver. They talked about feeling better understood by their friends and family. And they talked about feeling happier, even though they were in pain, even though they were tackling the toughest challenges of their lives.</p><p>At the time, I thought to myself, <i>What on earth is going on here?</i> How could a game so seemingly trivial, so admittedly simple, intervene so powerfully in such serious, in some cases life-and-death, circumstances? To be frank, if it hadn&#x2019;t already worked for me, there&#x2019;s no way I would have believed it was possible.</p><p>When I was recovered enough to do research, I dove into the scientific literature. And here&#x2019;s what I learned: some people get stronger and happier after a traumatic event. And that&#x2019;s what was happening to us. The game was helping us experience what scientists call <i>post-traumatic growth, </i>which is not something we usually hear about. More commonly, we hear about <i>post-traumatic stress disorder</i>, in which individuals experience ongoing anxiety and depression.</p><p>But research has shown that traumatic events don&#x2019;t always lead to long-term difficulty. Instead, some individuals find that struggling with highly challenging life circumstances helps them unleash their best qualities and eventually lead happier lives.2</p><p>To give you a better idea of what post-traumatic growth looks like, here are the top five things that people with post-traumatic growth say:</p><p>1. My priorities have changed. I&#x2019;m not afraid to do what makes me happy.</p><p>2. I feel closer to my friends and family.</p><p>3. I understand myself better. I know who I really am now.</p><p>4. I have a new sense of meaning and purpose in my life.</p><p>5. I&#x2019;m better able to focus on my goals and dreams.3</p><p>Taken together, these five traits represent a powerful positive transformation. But it&#x2019;s more than that. There&#x2019;s actually something quite astonishing about the benefits of post-traumatic growth, something I noticed in the course of my research.</p><p>A few years ago an Australian hospice worker named Bronnie Ware published an article called &#x201c;Regrets of the Dying.&#x201d;4 Ware would know&#x2014;she had spent a decade caring for patients at the end of their lives. She wrote that the same regrets were repeated again and again by her patients, year after year&#x2014;and after she published her article, she heard from hundreds of hospice workers and caretakers all over the world who confirmed her findings. They had heard the same five regrets over the years. Apparently they are nearly universal. Not everyone has regrets on their deathbed&#x2014;but if they do, they are likely to be one or more of the following:</p><p>1. I wish I hadn&#x2019;t worked so hard.</p><p>2. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.</p><p>3. I wish I had let myself be happier.</p><p>4. I wish I&#x2019;d had the courage to express my true self.</p><p>5. I wish I&#x2019;d lived a life true to my dreams, instead of what others expected of me.</p><p>Think about this list for a moment. Are you having the same &#x201c;aha!&#x201d; moment that I had, two years ago, when I first encountered it?</p><p>Remarkably, the top five regrets of the dying are essentially the <i>exact opposite</i> of the top five experiences of post-traumatic growth. With post-traumatic growth, we find the strength and courage to do the things that make us happy, and to understand and express our true selves. We prioritize relationships and meaningful work that inspires us.</p><p>Post-traumatic growth is not the opposite of post-traumatic stress disorder, by the way. Many people who suffer post-traumatic stress disorder <i>also </i>go on to experience post-traumatic growth. The two are not mutually exclusive by any means. In fact, one study found that symptoms of post-traumatic stress were actually predictive of eventual post-traumatic growth&#x2014;possibly because transformative growth requires wrestling in a deep and sustained way with something very difficult. If we bounce back too quickly, we miss the growth.5</p><p>Extreme personal challenge&#x2014;if we respond in the right way&#x2014;unlocks our ability to lead a life truer to our dreams and free of regrets. Looked at this way, post-traumatic growth&#x2014;or getting superbetter&#x2014;seems like a pretty strong candidate for the single most desirable personal transformation anyone could hope to undertake.</p><p>But how do you get from extreme stress or trauma to these five benefits? Research shows that not everyone who experiences a trauma goes on to have post-traumatic growth. So what exactly is the right process?</p><p>More important, is there any way to experience these benefits <i>without having a trauma</i>? I&#x2019;m pretty sure no one would ever choose to suffer a terrible loss, an injury, an illness, or any other kind of trauma just to get these benefits. But at the same time, who wouldn&#x2019;t want to lead a life truer to their dreams and free of regret?</p><p>And so I set off on another two years of research. And here&#x2019;s what I discovered: you <i>can </i>experience the benefits of post-traumatic growth without the trauma, if you are willing to undertake an extreme challenge in your life&#x2014;such as running a marathon, writing a book, starting a business, becoming a parent, quitting smoking, or making a spiritual journey. Researchers call this <i>post-ecstatic growth. </i>Ann Marie Roepke, a practicing clinical psychologist who first identified the phenomenon as a University of Pennsylvania doctoral candidate, describes it as &#x201c;gains without pains&#x201d;&#x2014;or at least, far fewer pains.6 It works the same way post-traumatic growth does, except you get to choose your own challenge. Instead of waiting for life to throw a terrible trauma at you, you can cultivate post-ecstatic growth at any time by intentionally undertaking a meaningful project or mission that creates significant stress and challenge for you. This stressful adventure you&#x2019;ve chosen for yourself creates the necessary conditions for you...</p></p><h2>Love, Loss, and What We Ate: A Memoir</h2><p><p><strong>A vivid memoir of food and family, survival and triumph,&nbsp;<em>Love, Loss, and What We Ate</em>&nbsp;traces the arc of Padma Lakshmi&#x2019;s unlikely path from an immigrant childhood to a complicated life in front of the camera&#x2014;a tantalizing blend of Ruth Reichl&#x2019;s <em>Tender at the Bone</em> and Nora Ephron&#x2019;s <em>Heartburn</em></strong></p><p>Long before Padma Lakshmi ever stepped onto a television set, she learned that how we eat is an extension of how we love, how we comfort, how we forge a sense of home&#x2014;and how we taste the world as we navigate our way through it.

The ground was thick with fallen leaves; the horses&#x2019; hooves made little sound and it was hard to tell whether we were still on the road. A wretched track, Barak had called it earlier, grumbling yet again about the wildness of this barbarian land I had brought him to. I had not replied for I was bone-tired, my poor back sore and my legs in their heavy riding boots as stiff as boards. I was worried, too, for the strange mission that now lay close ahead was weighing on my mind. I lifted a hand from the reins and felt in my coat pocket for the Archbishop&#x2019;s seal, fingering it like a talisman and remembering Cranmer&#x2019;s promise: &#x2018;This will be safe enough, there will be no danger.&#x2019;</p><p>I had left much care behind me as well, for six days before, I had buried my father in Lichfield. Barak and I had had five days&#x2019; hard riding northwards since then, the roads in a bad state after that wet summer of 1541. We rode into wild country where many villages still consisted of the old longhouses, people and cattle crammed together in hovels of thatch and sod. We left the Great North Road that afternoon at Flaxby. Barak wanted to rest the night at an inn, but I insisted we ride on, even if it took all night. I reminded him we were late, tomorrow would be the twelfth of September and we must reach our destination well before the King arrived.</p><p>The road, though, had soon turned to mud, and as night fell we had left it for a drier track that veered to the northeast, through thick woodland and bare fields where pigs rooted among the patches of yellow stubble.</p><p>The woodland turned to forest and for hours now we had been picking our way through it. We lost the main track once and it was the Devil&#x2019;s own job to find it again in the dark. All was silent save for the whisper of fallen leaves and an occasional clatter of brushwood as a boar or wildcat fled from us. The horses, laden with panniers containing our clothes and other necessities, were as exhausted as Barak and I. I could feel Genesis&#x2019; tiredness and Sukey, Barak&#x2019;s normally energetic mare, was content to follow his slow pace.</p><p>&#x2018;We&#x2019;re lost,&#x2019; he grumbled.</p><p>&#x2018;They said at the inn to follow the main path south through the forest. Anyway, it must be daylight soon,&#x2019; I said. &#x2018;Then we&#x2019;ll see where we are.&#x2019;</p><p>Barak grunted wearily. &#x2018;Feels like we&#x2019;ve ridden to Scotland. I wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if we get taken for ransom.&#x2019; I did not reply, tired at his complaining, and we plodded on silently.</p><p>My mind went back to my father&#x2019;s funeral the week before. The little group of people round the grave, the coffin lowered into the earth. My cousin Bess, who had found him dead in his bed when she brought him a parcel of food.</p><p>&#x2018;I wish I had known how ill he was,&#x2019; I told her when we returned to the farm afterwards. &#x2018;It should have been me that looked after him.&#x2019;</p><p>She shook her head wearily. &#x2018;You were far away in London and we&#x2019;d not seen you for over a year.&#x2019; Her eyes had an accusing look.</p><p>&#x2018;I have had difficult times of my own, Bess. But I would have come.&#x2019;</p><p>She sighed. &#x2018;It was old William Poer dying last autumn undid him. They&#x2019;d wrestled to get a profit from the farm these last few years and he seemed to give up.&#x2019; She paused. &#x2018;I said he should contact you, but he wouldn&#x2019;t. God sends us hard trials. The droughts last summer, now the floods this year. I think he was ashamed of the money troubles he&#x2019;d got into. Then the fever took him.&#x2019;</p><p>I nodded. It had been a shock to learn that the farm where I had grown up, and which now was mine, was deep in debt. My father had been near seventy, his steward William not much younger. Their care of the land had not been all it should and the last few harvests had been poor. To get by he had taken a mortgage on the farm with a rich landowner in Lichfield. The first I knew of it was when the mortgagee wrote to me, immediately after Father&#x2019;s death, to say he doubted the value of the land would clear the debt. Like many gentry in those days he was seeking to increase his acreage for sheep, and granting mortgages to elderly farmers at exorbitant interest was one way of doing it.</p><p>&#x2018;That bloodsucker Sir Henry,&#x2019; I said bitterly to Bess.</p><p>&#x2018;What will you do? Let the estate go insolvent?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No,&#x2019; I said. &#x2018;I won&#x2019;t disgrace Father&#x2019;s name. I&#x2019;ll pay it.&#x2019; I thought, God knows I owe him that.</p><p>&#x2018;That is good.&#x2019;</p><p>I came to with a start at the sound of a protesting whicker behind me. Barak had pulled on Sukey&#x2019;s reins, bringing her to a stop. I halted too and turned uncomfortably in the saddle. His outline and that of the trees were sharper now, it was beginning to get light. He pointed in front of him. &#x2018;Look there!&#x2019;</p><p>Ahead the trees were thinning. In the distance I saw a red point of light, low in the sky.</p><p>&#x2018;There!&#x2019; I said triumphantly. &#x2018;The lamp we were told to look out for, that&#x2019;s set atop a church steeple to guide travellers. This is the Galtres Forest, like I said!&#x2019;</p><p>We rode out of the trees. A cold wind blew up from the river as the sky lightened. We wrapped our coats tighter round us and rode down, towards York.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>THE MAIN ROAD into the city was already filled with packhorses and carts loaded with food of every kind. There were enormous forester&#x2019;s carts too, whole tree-trunks dangling dangerously over their tails. Ahead the high city walls came into view, black with the smoke of hundreds of years, and beyond were the steeples of innumerable churches, all dominated by the soaring twin towers of York Minster. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s busy as Cheapside on a market-day,&#x2019; I observed.</p><p>&#x2018;All for the King&#x2019;s great retinue.&#x2019;</p><p>We rode slowly on, the throng so dense we scarce managed a walking pace. I cast sidelong glances at my companion. It was over a year now since I had taken Jack Barak on as assistant in my barrister&#x2019;s practice after his old master&#x2019;s execution. A former child of the London streets who had ended up working on dubious missions for Thomas Cromwell, he was an unlikely choice, even though he was clever and had the good fortune to be literate. Yet I had not regretted it. He had adjusted well to working for me, doggedly learning the law. No one was better at keeping witnesses to the point while preparing affidavits, or ferreting out obscure facts, and his cynical, slantwise view of the system was a useful corrective to my own enthusiasm.</p><p>These last few months, however, Barak had often seemed downcast, and sometimes would forget his place and become as oafish and mocking as when I had first met him. I feared he might be getting bored, and thought bringing him to York might rouse him out of himself. He was, though, full of a Londoner&#x2019;s prejudices against the north and northerners, and had complained and griped almost the whole way. Now he was looking dubiously around him, suspicious of everything.</p><p>Houses appeared straggling along the road and then, to our right, a high old crenellated wall over which an enormous steeple was visible. Soldiers patrolled the top of the wall, wearing iron helmets and the white tunics with a red cross of royal longbowmen. Instead of bows and arrows, though, they carried swords and fearsome pikes, and some even bore long matchlock guns. A great sound of banging and hammering came from within.</p><p>&#x2018;That must be the old St Mary&#x2019;s Abbey, where we&#x2019;ll be staying,&#x2019; I said. &#x2018;Sounds like there&#x2019;s a lot of work going on to make it ready for the King.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Shall we go there now, leave our bags?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No, we should see Brother Wrenne first, then go to the castle.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;To see the prisoner?&#x2019; he asked quietly.</p><p>&#x2018;Ay.&#x2019;</p><p>Barak looked up at the walls. &#x2018;St Mary&#x2019;s is guarded well.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;The King will be none too sure of his welcome, after all that&#x2019;s happened up here.&#x2019;</p><p>I had spoken softly, but the man in front of us, walking beside a packhorse laden with grain, turned and gave us a sharp look. Barak raised his eyebrows and he looked away. I wondered if he was one of the Council of the North&#x2019;s informers; they would be working overtime in York now.</p><p>&#x2018;Perhaps you should put on your lawyer&#x2019;s robe,&#x2019; Barak suggested, nodding ahead. The carts and packmen were turning into the abbey through a large gate in the wall. Just past the gate the abbey wall met the city wall at right angles, hard by a fortress-like gatehouse decorated with the York coat of arms, five white lions against a red background. More guards were posted there, holding pikes and wearing steel helmets and breastplates. Beyond the wall, the Minster towers were huge now against the grey sky.</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m not fetching it out of my pack, I&#x2019;m too tired.&#x2019; I patted my coat pocket. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve got the Chamberlain&#x2019;s authority here.&#x2019; Archbishop Cranmer&#x2019;s seal was there too; but that was only to be shown to one person. I stared ahead, at something I had been told to expect yet which still made me shudder: four heads fixed to tall poles, boiled and black and half eaten by crows. I knew that twelve of the rebel conspirators arrested that spring had been executed in York, their heads and quarters set on all the city gates as a warning to others.</p><p>We halted at the end of a little queue, the horses&#x2019; heads drooping with tiredness. The guards had stopped a poorly dressed man and were questioning him roughly abou...</p></p><h2>Epossumondas</h2><p>Who's Epossumondas? Why, he's his mama's and his auntie's sweet little patootie, that's who. He's also the silliest, most lovable, most muddleheaded possum south of the Mason-Dixon line!<br>Better choose your words wisely when he's around, 'cause otherwise you never know <i>what</i> you'll get. Epossumondas just might bring you a fist full of crumbs, or a soaking wet puppy, or a scruffy wad of bread--oh, you just wouldn't believe it!<br>Renowned storyteller Coleen Salley and Caldecott Honor illustrator Janet Stevens team up for this outrageous twist on the Southern story of the noodlehead who takes everything <i>way</i> too literally. (Or is that Epossumondas just pulling his mama's leg?)<br></p><p>Veteran children's lit professor Coleen Salley tells a variation on her signature story, an archetypal "noodlehead" tale based on the time-honored Southern legend of Epaminondas. A "sweet patootie" named Epossumondas headlines here as a be-diapered young possum who follows his mama's instructions a little too literally.<p> "Queen Coleen" (as Salley sometimes goes in her native New Orleans) tells her story in slow, old-South cadence, repeating a cycle where Epossumondas visits his auntie "most every day" and receives something to take home to his mama's. His gifts, however, never seem to arrive intact: After Epossumondas arrives home with a piece of cake that's been squinched into a fistful of crumbs, his mama scolds, "Oh, Epossumondas, you don't have the sense you were born with! That's no way to carry cake! The way to carry cake is to put the cake on your head, put a hat on your head, and come along home." But the next day, Auntie gives him butter, which then gets carried home cake-style (on his head). The next day, he gets "a sweet little puppy," which then gets carried home butter-style (wrapped in leaves and cooled in a brook), etc.</p><p> Caldecott Honor-winner Janet Stevens has obvious fun capturing Epossumondas's ridiculous errands in watercolor and colored pencil, especially as other bayou animals look on in puzzlement. But Steven's biggest coup has to be conveying the story's subtle secret--that Epossumondas might not be as dumb as he looks.

Why does poverty persist? Why do organizations get stuck firefighting? Why do the lonely find it hard to make friends? These questions seem unconnected, yet Sendhil Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir show that they are all examples of a mind-set produced by scarcity.</p><p>Drawing on cutting-edge research from behavioral science and economics, Mullainathan and Shafir show that scarcity creates a similar psychology for everyone struggling to manage with less than they need. Busy people fail to manage their time efficiently for the same reasons the poor and those maxed out on credit cards fail to manage their money. The dynamics of scarcity reveal why dieters find it hard to resist temptation, why students and busy executives mismanage their time, and why sugarcane farmers are smarter after harvest than before. Once we start thinking in terms of scarcity and the strategies it imposes, the problems of modern life come into sharper focus.</p><p>Mullainathan and Shafir discuss how scarcity affects our daily lives, recounting anecdotes of their own foibles and making surprising connections that bring this research alive. Their book provides a new way of understanding why the poor stay poor and the busy stay busy, and it reveals not only how scarcity leads us astray but also how individuals and organizations can better manage scarcity for greater satisfaction and success.</p></p><p><p><b>Sendhil Mullainathan</b>, a professor of economics at Harvard University, is a recipient of a MacArthur Foundation "genius grant" and conducts research on development economics, behavioral economics, and corporate finance.

He had more to-dos than time to do them in. Deadlines had matured from "overdue" to "alarmingly late." Meetings had been sheepishly rescheduled. His in-box was swelling with messages that needed his attention. He could picture his mother's hurt face at not getting even an occasional call. His car registration had expired. And things were getting worse. That conference one connecting flight away seemed like a good idea six months ago. Not so much now. Falling behind had turned into a vicious cycle. Re-registering the car was now one more thing to do. A project had taken a wrong direction because of a tardy e-mail response; getting it back on track meant yet more work. The past-due pile of life was growing dangerously close to toppling.</p> <p>The irony of spending time lamenting the lack of time was not lost on Eldar. It was only partly lost on Sendhil who, undeterred, described his plan for getting out.</p> <p>He would first stem the tide. Old obligations would need to be fulfilled, but new ones could be avoided. He would say no to every new request. He would prevent further delays on old projects by working meticulously to finish them. Eventually, this austerity would pay off. The to-do pile would shrink to a manageable level. Only then would he even think about new projects. And of course he would be more prudent going forward. "Yes" would be rare and uttered only after careful scrutiny. It would not be easy, but it was necessary.</p> <p>Having made the plan felt good. Of course it did. As Voltaire noted long ago, "Illusion is the first of all pleasures."</p> <p>A week later, another call from Sendhil: Two colleagues were putting together a book on the lives of low-income Americans. "This is a great opportunity. We should write a chapter," he said. His voice, Eldar recalls, lacked even a trace of irony.</p> <p>Predictably, the chapter was "too good to pass up," and we agreed to do it. Just as predictably, it was a mistake, written in a rush and behind schedule. Unpredictably, it was a worthwhile mistake, creating an unexpected connection that eventually led to this book.</p> <p>Here is an excerpt from our background notes for that chapter:</p> <p><i>Shawn, an office manager in Cleveland, was struggling to make ends meet. He was late on a bunch of bills. His credit cards were maxed out. His paycheck ran out quickly. As he said, "There is always more month than money." The other day, he accidentally bounced a check after overestimating the money in his account; he had forgotten a $22 purchase. Every phone call made him tense: another creditor calling to "remind" him? Being out of money was also affecting his personal life. Sometimes at dinner he would put in less than his fair share because he was short. His friends understood, but it didn't feel good.</i></p> <p><i>And there was no end in sight. He had bought a Blu-ray player on credit, with no payments for the first six months. That was five months ago. How would he pay this extra bill next month? Already, more and more money went to paying off old debts. The bounced check had a hefty overdraft charge. The late bills meant late fees. His finances were a mess. He was in the deep end of the debt pool and barely staying afloat.</i></p> <p>Shawn, like many people in his situation, got financial advice from many sources, all of it pretty similar:</p> <p><i>Don't sink any deeper. Stop borrowing. Cut your spending to the minimum. Some expenses may be tough to cut, but you'll have to learn how. Pay off your old debts as quickly as possible. Eventually, with no new debts, your payments will become manageable. After this, remain vigilant so as not to fall back in. Spend and borrow wisely. Avoid unaffordable luxuries. If you must borrow, be clear about what it takes to pay it back.</i></p> <p>This advice worked better in theory than in practice for Shawn. Resisting temptation is hard. Resisting all temptations was even harder. A leather jacket he had coveted went on sale at a great price. Skimping on his daughter's birthday gift felt less sensible as the day got closer. There were too many ways to spend more than he planned. Shawn eventually sank back into the debt pool.</p> <p>It did not take long for us to notice the resemblance between Sendhil's and Shawn's behavior. Missed deadlines are a lot like overdue bills. Double-booked meetings (committing time you do not have) are a lot like bounced checks (spending money you do not have). The busier you are, the greater the need to say no. The more indebted you are, the greater the need to not buy. Plans to escape sound reasonable but prove hard to implement. They require constant vigilance&#x2014;about what to buy or what to agree to do. When vigilance flags&#x2014;the slightest temptation in time or in money&#x2014;you sink deeper. Shawn ended up stuck with accumulating debt. Sendhil ended up stuck under mounting commitments.</p> <p>This resemblance is striking because the circumstances are so different. We normally think of time management and money management as distinct problems. The consequences of failing are different: bad time management leads to embarrassment or poor job performance; bad money management leads to fees or eviction. The cultural contexts are different: falling behind and missing a deadline means one thing to a busy professional; falling behind and missing a debt payment means something else to an urban low-wage worker. The surroundings differ. The education levels differ. Even aspirations can differ. Yet despite these differences, the end behavior is remarkably similar.</p> <p>Sendhil and Shawn did have one thing in common: each of them was feeling the effects of scarcity. By scarcity, we mean <i>having less than you feel you need</i>. Sendhil felt harried; he felt he had too little time to do all the things he needed to do. Shawn felt cash strapped, with too little money for all the bills he needed to pay. Could this common connection explain their behavior? Could it be that scarcity itself led Sendhil and Shawn to behave in such similar ways?</p> <p>Uncovering a common logic to scarcity would have big implications. Scarcity is a broad concept that extends well beyond these personal anecdotes. The problem of unemployment, for example, is also the problem of financial scarcity. The loss of a job makes a household's budget suddenly tight&#x2014;too little income to cover the mortgage, car payments, and day-to-day expenses. The problem of increasing social isolation&#x2014;"bowling alone"&#x2014;is a form of social scarcity, of people having too few social bonds. The problem of obesity is also, perhaps counterintuitively, a problem of scarcity. Sticking to a diet requires coping with the challenge of having less to eat than you feel accustomed to&#x2014;a tight calorie budget or calorie scarcity. The problem of global poverty&#x2014;the tragedy of multitudes of people around the world making do with a dollar or two a day&#x2014;is another kind of financial scarcity. Unlike the sudden and possibly fleeting tightening of one's budget due to job loss, poverty means a perpetually tight budget.</p> <p>Scarcity connects more than just Sendhil's and Shawn's problems: it forms a common chord across so many of society's problems. These problems occur in different cultures, economic conditions, and political systems, but they all feature scarcity. Could there be a common logic to scarcity, one that operates across these diverse backdrops?</p> <p>We had to answer this question. We were too busy not to.</p> <p>SCARCITY&nbsp;CAPTURES&nbsp;THE&nbsp;MIND</p> <p>Our interest in scarcity led us to a remarkable study from more than a half century ago. The authors of that study did not think of themselves as studying scarcity, but to our eyes they were studying an extreme form of it&#x2014;starvation. It was toward the end of World War II, and the Allies realized they had a problem. As they advanced into German-occupied territories, they would encounter great numbers of people on the edge of starvation. The problem was not food; the Americans and British had enough to feed the prisoners and the civilians they were liberating. Their problem was more technical. How do you begin feeding people who have been on the edge of starvation for so long? Should they be given full meals? Should they be allowed to eat as much as they want? Or should you start by underfeeding them and slowly increase their intake? What was the safest way to bring people back from the edge of starvation?</p> <p>The experts at the time had few answers. So a team at the University of Minnesota conducted an experiment to find out. Understanding how to feed people, though, requires first starving them. The experiment started with healthy male volunteers in a controlled environment where their calories were reduced until they were subsisting on just enough food so as not to permanently harm themselves. After a few months of this, the real experiment began: finding out how their bodies responded to different feeding regimens. Not an easy experiment to be a subject in, but this was "the Good War," and conscientious objectors who did not go to the front were willing to do their part.</p> <p>The thirty-six subjects in the study were housed in a dormitory and were carefully monitored, with every behavior observed and noted. Though the researchers cared most about the feeding part of the study, they also measured the impact of starvation. Much of what happens to starving bodies is quite graphic. Subjects lost so much fat on their butts that sitting became painful; the men had to use pillows. Actual weight loss was complicated by edema&#x2014;the men accumulated as much as fourteen pounds of extra fluid due to starvation. Their metabolism slowed down by 40 percent. They lost strength and endurance. As one subject put it, "I notice the weakness in my arms when I wash my hair in the shower; they become completely fatigued in the course of this simple operation."</p> <p>Not only did their bodies weaken; their minds changed as well. Sharman Apt Russell describes a lunch scene in her book <i>Hunger</i>:</p> <p><i>The men became impatient waiting in line if the service was slow. They were possessive about their food. Some hunched over their trays using their arms to protect their meal. Mostly they were silent, with the concentration that eating deserved. . . . Dislikes for certain foods, such as rutabagas, disappeared. All food was eaten to the last bite. Then they licked their plates.</i></p> <p>This is largely what you might expect of people who are starving. But some mental changes they showed were more unexpected:</p> <p><i>Obsessions developed around cookbooks and menus from local restaurants. Some men could spend hours comparing the prices of fruits and vegetables from one newspaper to the next. Some planned now to go into agriculture. They dreamed of new careers as restaurant owners. . . . They lost their will for academic problems and became far more interested in cookbooks. . . . When they went to the movies, only the scenes with food held their interest.</i></p> <p>They were focused on food. Of course if you are starving, getting more food should be a priority. But their minds focused in a way that transcended practical benefits. The delusions of starting a restaurant, comparing food prices, and researching cookbooks will not alleviate hunger. If anything, all this thinking about food&#x2014;almost a fixation&#x2014;surely heightened the pain of hunger. They did not choose this. Here is how one participant in the Minnesota study recalled the frustration of constantly thinking about food:</p> <p><i>I don't know many other things in my life that I looked forward to being over with any more than this experiment. And it wasn't so much . . . because of the physical discomfort, but because it made food the most important thing in one's life . . . food became the one central and only thing really in one's life. And life is pretty dull if that's the only thing. I mean, if you went to a movie, you weren't particularly interested in the love scenes, but you noticed every time they ate and what they ate.</i></p> <p>The hungry men did not choose to ignore the plot in favor of the food. They did not choose to put food at the top of their mind. Instead, hunger captured their thinking and their attention. These behaviors were only a footnote in the Minnesota study, not at all what the researchers were interested in. To us, they illustrate how scarcity changes us.</p> <p>Scarcity captures the mind. Just as the starving subjects had food on their mind, when we experience scarcity of any kind, we become absorbed by it. The mind orients automatically, powerfully, toward unfulfilled needs. For the hungry, that need is food. For the busy it might be a project that needs to be finished. For the cash-strapped it might be this month's rent payment; for the lonely, a lack of companionship. Scarcity is more than just the displeasure of having very little. It changes how we think. It imposes itself on our minds.</p> <p>This is a lot to infer from just one study. Starvation is an extreme case: it involves scarcity but it also involves many other physiological changes. The study had only thirty-six subjects. The evidence we cite consists largely of the mutterings of hungry men, not hard numbers. But many other, more precise studies have shown the same results. Not only that, they give a window into exactly how scarcity captures the mind.</p> <p>One recent study asked subjects to come to a lab around lunchtime, not having eaten for three to four hours. Half of these hungry subjects were sent out to grab lunch, the others weren't. So half were hungry and half were sated. Their task in the study was simple: Watch a screen. A word will flash. Identify the word you just saw. So, for example, <i>TAKE</i> might flash and the subjects would have to decide whether they just saw <i>TAKE</i> or <i>RAKE</i>. This seems a trivial task and it would have been except that everything happened quickly. Very quickly. The word itself flashes for 33 milliseconds&#x2014;that is, 1/30 of a second.</p> <p>Now you might think that the hungry subjects might do worse, being tired and unfocused from their hunger. But on this particular task, they did as well as the sated subjects. Except in one case. The hungry did much <i>better</i> on food-related words. They were much more likely to accurately detect the word <i>CAKE</i>. Tasks such as these are designed to tell us what is at the top of someone's mind. When a concept occupies our thoughts, we see words related to it more quickly. So when the hungry recognize <i>CAKE</i> more quickly, we see directly that food is at the top of their minds. Here we do not rely on odd behaviors such as leafing through cookbooks or making plans to be a restaurateur to infer their fixation. The speed and accuracy of their responses directly show us that scarcity has captured the hungry subjects' minds.</p> <p>And it does so on a subconscious level. The tiny time scales in this task&#x2014;outcomes measured in milliseconds&#x2014;were devised to observe fast processes, fast enough to remain beyond conscious control. We now know enough about the brain to know what these time scales mean. Complex higher-order calculations require more than 300 milliseconds. Faster responses rely on more automatic subconscious processes. So when the hungry recognize <i>CAKE</i> more quickly, it is not because they <i>choose</i> to focus more on this word. It happens faster than they could choose to do anything. This is why we use the word <i>capture</i> when describing how scarcity focuses the mind.</p> <p>This phenomenon i...</p></p><h2>Ron Brown&#39;s Body: How One Man&#39;s Death Saved the Clinton Presidency and Hillary&#39;s Future</h2><p>The mysterious death of Ron Brown has caused much controversy and suspicion, and in this investigative book, Cashill takes a close look at Brown&#39;s checkered career as Clinton fund-raiser and commerce secretary and consequently exposes the Clintons&#39; dirty, relentless practices for getting financial backing.

Slowly, slowly, his hands moved across my skin, down the sides of my stomach to finally rest in the curves of my hips. Just below my ear, I felt his lips press against my neck, followed by another kiss just below it, then another, then another....</p><p>His lips moved from my neck toward my cheek and then finally found my mouth. We kissed, wrapping ourselves closer together. My blood burned within me, and I felt more alive in that moment than I ever had. I loved him, loved Christian so much that&#x2014; </p><p>Christian? </p><p>Oh no. </p><p>Some coherent part of me immediately realized what was happening&#x2014;and boy, was it pissed off. The rest of me, however, was still actually living in this encounter, experiencing it as though I was the one being touched and kissed. That part of me couldn&#x2019;t break away. I&#x2019;d merged too much with Lissa, and for all intents and purposes, this was happening to me. </p><p>No, I told myself sternly. It&#x2019;s not real&#x2014;not for you. Get out of there. </p><p>But how could I listen to logic when every nerve of my body was being set on fire?</p><p>You aren&#x2019;t her. This isn&#x2019;t your head. Get out. </p><p>His lips. There was nothing in the world right now except his lips. </p><p>It&#x2019;s not him. Get out. </p><p>The kisses were the same, exactly as I remembered with him....</p><p>No, it&#x2019;s not Dimitri. Get out! </p><p>Dimitri&#x2019;s name was like cold water hitting me in the face. I got out. </p><p>I sat upright in my bed, suddenly feeling smothered. I tried kicking off the covers but mostly ended up entangling my legs even more. My heart beat hard in my chest, and I tried to take deep breaths to steady myself and return to my own reality. </p><p>Times sure had changed. A long time ago, Lissa&#x2019;s nightmares used to wake me from sleep. Now her sex life did. To say the two were a little different would be an understatement. I&#x2019;d actually gotten the hang of blocking out her romantic interludes&#x2014;at least when I was awake. This time, Lissa and Christian had (unintentionally) outsmarted me. In sleep, my defenses were down, allowing strong emotions to pass through the psychic link that connected me to my best friend. This wouldn&#x2019;t have been a problem if the two of them had been in bed like normal people&#x2014;and by &#x201c;being in bed,&#x201d; I mean &#x201c;asleep.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;God,&#x201d; I muttered, sitting up and swinging my legs over the side of the bed. My voice was muffled in a yawn. Couldn&#x2019;t Lissa and Christian have seriously kept their hands off each other until waking hours? </p><p>Worse than being woken up, though, was the way I still felt. Sure, none of that making out had actually happened to me. It hadn&#x2019;t been my skin being touched or my lips being kissed. Yet my body seemed to feel the loss of it nonetheless. It had been a very long time since I&#x2019;d been in that kind of situation. I ached and felt warm all over. It was idiotic, but suddenly, desperately, I wanted someone to touch me&#x2014;even just to hold me. But definitely not Christian. The memory of those lips on mine flashed back through my mind, how they&#x2019;d felt, and how my sleepy self had been so certain it was Dimitri kissing me. </p><p>I stood up on shaky legs, feeling restless and . . . well, sad. Sad and empty. Needing to walk off my weird mood, I put on a robe and slippers and left my room for the bathroom down the hall. I splashed cool water on my face and stared in the mirror. The reflection looking back at me had tangled hair and bloodshot eyes. I looked sleep-deprived, but I didn&#x2019;t want to go back to bed. I didn&#x2019;t want to risk falling asleep quite yet. I needed something to wake me up and shake away what I&#x2019;d seen. </p><p>I left the bathroom and turned toward the stairwell, my feet light on the steps as I went downstairs. The first floor of my dorm was still and quiet. It was almost noon&#x2014;the middle of the night for vampires, since they ran on a nocturnal schedule. Lurking near the edge of a doorway, I scanned the lobby. It was empty, save for the yawning Moroi man sitting at the front desk. He leafed halfheartedly through a magazine, held to consciousness only by the finest of threads. He came to the magazine&#x2019;s end and yawned again. Turning in his revolving chair, he tossed the magazine on a table behind him and reached for what must have been something else to read. </p><p>While his back was turned, I darted past him toward the set of double doors that opened outside. Praying the doors wouldn&#x2019;t squeak, I carefully opened one a crack, just enough to slip through. Once outside, I eased the door shut as gently as possible. No noise. At most, the guy would feel a draft. Feeling like a ninja, I stepped out into the light of day. </p><p>Cold wind blasted me in the face, but it was exactly what I needed. Leafless tree branches swayed in that wind, clawing at the sides of the stone dorm like fingernails. The sun peeped at me from between lead-colored clouds, further reminding me that I should be in bed and asleep. Squinting at the light, I tugged my robe tighter and walked around the side of the building, toward a spot between it and the gym that wasn&#x2019;t quite so exposed to the elements. The slush on the sidewalk soaked into the cloth of my slippers, but I didn&#x2019;t care. </p><p>Yeah, it was a typically miserable winter day in Montana, but that was the point. The crisp air did a lot to wake me up and chase off the remnants of the virtual love scene. Plus, it kept me firmly in my own head. Focusing on the cold in my body was better than remembering what it had felt like to have Christian&#x2019;s hands on me. Standing there, staring off at a cluster of trees without really seeing them, I was surprised to feel a spark of anger at Lissa and Christian. It must be nice, I thought bitterly, to do whatever the hell you wanted. Lissa had often commented that she wished she could feel my mind and experiences the way I could feel hers. The truth was, she had no idea how lucky she was. She had no idea what it was like to have someone else&#x2019;s thoughts intruding on yours, someone else&#x2019;s experiences muddling yours. She didn&#x2019;t know what it was like to live with someone else&#x2019;s perfect love life when your own was nonexistent. She didn&#x2019;t understand what it was like to be filled with a love so strong that it made your chest ache&#x2014;a love you could only feel and not express. Keeping love buried was a lot like keeping anger pent up, I&#x2019;d learned. It just ate you up inside until you wanted to scream or kick something. </p><p>No, Lissa didn&#x2019;t understand any of that. She didn&#x2019;t have to. She could carry on with her own romantic affairs, with no regard for what she was doing to me. </p><p>I noticed then that I was breathing heavily again, this time with rage. The icky feeling I&#x2019;d felt over Lissa and Christian&#x2019;s late-night hookup was gone. It had been replaced by anger and jealousy, feelings born of what I couldn&#x2019;t have and what came so easily to her. I tried my best to swallow those emotions back; I didn&#x2019;t want to feel that way toward my best friend. </p><p>&#x201c;Are you sleepwalking?&#x201d; a voice asked behind me. </p><p>I spun around, startled. Dimitri stood there watching me, looking both amused and curious. It would figure that while I was raging over the problems in my unfair love life, the source of those problems would be the one to find me. I hadn&#x2019;t heard him approach at all. So much for my ninja skills. And honestly, would it have killed me to pick up a brush before I went outside? Hastily, I ran a hand through my long hair, knowing it was a little too late. It probably looked like an animal had died on top of my head. </p><p>&#x201c;I was testing dorm security,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It sucks.&#x201d; </p><p>A hint of a smile played over his lips. The cold was really starting to seep into me now, and I couldn&#x2019;t help but notice how warm his long leather coat looked. I wouldn&#x2019;t have minded wrapping up in it. </p><p>As though reading my mind, he said, &#x201c;You must be freezing. Do you want my coat?&#x201d; </p><p>I shook my head, deciding not to mention that I couldn&#x2019;t feel my feet. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. What are you doing out here? Are you testing security too?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I am security. This is my watch.&#x201d; Shifts of school guardians always patrolled the grounds while everyone else slept. Strigoi, the undead vampires who stalked living Moroi vampires like Lissa, didn&#x2019;t come out in sunlight, but students breaking rules&#x2014;say, like, sneaking out of their dorms&#x2014;were a problem night and day. </p><p>&#x201c;Well, good work,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad I was able to help test your awesome skills. I should be going now.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Rose&#x2014;&#x201d; Dimitri&#x2019;s hand caught my arm, and despite all the wind and chill and slush, a flash of heat shot through me. He released me with a start, as though he too had been burned. &#x201c;What are you really doing out here?&#x201d; </p><p>He was using the stop fooling around voice, so I gave him as truthful an answer as I could. &#x201c;I had a bad dream. I wanted some air.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;And so you just rushed out. Breaking the rules didn&#x2019;t even cross your mind&#x2014;and neither did putting on a coat.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;That pretty much sums it up.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Rose, Rose.&#x201d; This time it was his exasperated voice. &#x201c;You never change. Always jumping in without thinking.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not true,&#x201d; I protested. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve changed a lot.&#x201d; </p><p>The amusement on his face suddenly faded, his expression growing troubled. He studied me for several moments. Sometimes I felt as though those eyes could see right into my soul. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. You have changed.&#x201d;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t seem very happy about the admission. He was probably thinking about what had happened almost three weeks ago, when some friends and I had gotten ourselves captured by Strigoi. It was only through sheer luck that we&#x2019;d managed to escape&#x2014;and not all of us had gotten out. Mason, a good friend and a guy who&#x2019;d been crazy about me, had been killed, and part of me would never forgive myself for it, even though I&#x2019;d killed his murderers. </p><p>It had given me a darker outlook on life. Well, it had given everyone here at St. Vladimir&#x2019;s Academy a darker outlook, but me especially. Others had begun to notice the difference in me. I didn&#x2019;t like to see Dimitri concerned, though, so I played off his observation with a joke. </p><p>&#x201c;Well, don&#x2019;t worry. My birthday&#x2019;s coming up. As soon as I&#x2019;m eighteen, I&#x2019;ll be an adult, right? I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;ll wake up that morning and be all mature and stuff.&#x201d; </p><p>As I&#x2019;d hoped, his frown softened into a small smile. &#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;m sure. What is it, about a month?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Thirty-one days,&#x201d; I announced primly. </p><p>&#x201c;Not that you&#x2019;re counting.&#x201d;</p><p>I shrugged, and he laughed. </p><p>&#x201c;I suppose you&#x2019;ve made a birthday list too. Ten pages? Single-spaced? Ranked by order of priority?&#x201d; The smile was still on his face. It was one of the relaxed, genuinely amused ones that were so rare to him. </p><p>I started to make another joke, but the image of Lissa and Christian flared into my mind again. That sad and empty feeling in my stomach returned. Anything I might have wanted &#x2014; new clothes, an iPod, whatever&#x2014;suddenly seemed trivial. What did material things like that mean compared to the one thing I wanted most of all? God, I really had changed. </p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said in a small voice. &#x201c;No list.&#x201d; </p><p>He tilted his head to better look at me, making some of his shoulder-length hair blow into his face. His hair was brown, like mine, but not nearly as dark. Mine looked black at times. He brushed the unruly strands aside, only to have them immediately blow back into his face. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe you don&#x2019;t want anything. It&#x2019;s going to be a boring birthday.&#x201d; </p><p>Freedom, I thought. That was the only gift I longed for. Freedom to make my own choices. Freedom to love who I wanted. </p><p>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter,&#x201d; I said instead. </p><p>&#x201c;What do you&#x2014;&#x201d; He stopped. He understood. He always did. It was part of why we connected like we did, in spite of the seven-year gap in our ages. We&#x2019;d fallen for each other last fall when he&#x2019;d been my combat instructor. As things heated up between us, we&#x2019;d found we had more things to worry about than just age. We were both going to be protecting Lissa when she graduated, and we couldn&#x2019;t let our feelings for each other distract us when she was our priority. </p><p>Of course, that was easier said than done because I didn&#x2019;t think our feelings for each other were ever really going to go away. We&#x2019;d both had moments of weakness, moments that led to stolen kisses or saying things we really shouldn&#x2019;t have. After I&#x2019;d escaped the Strigoi, Dimitri had told me he loved me and had pretty much admitted he could never be with anyone else because of that. Yet, it had also become clear that we still couldn&#x2019;t be together either, and we had both slipped back into our old roles of keeping away from each other and pretending that our relationship was strictly professional. </p><p>In a not-so-obvious attempt to change the subject, he said, &#x201c;You can deny it all you want, but I know you&#x2019;re freezing. Let&#x2019;s go inside. I&#x2019;ll take you in through the back.&#x201d; </p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t help feeling a little surprised. Dimitri was rarely one to avoid uncomfortable subjects. In fact, he was notorious for pushing me into conversations about topics I didn&#x2019;t want to deal with. But talking about our dysfunctional, star-crossed relationship? That was a place he apparently didn&#x2019;t want to go today. Yeah. Things were definitely changing. </p><p>&#x201c;I think you&#x2019;re the one who&#x2019;s cold,&#x201d; I teased, as we walked around the side of the dorm where novice guardians lived. &#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t you be all tough and stuff, since you&#x2019;re from Siberia?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think Siberia&#x2019;s exactly what you imagine.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I imagine it as an arctic wasteland,&#x201d; I said truthfully. </p><p>&#x201c;Then it&#x2019;s definitely not what you imagine.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Do you miss it?&#x201d; I asked, glancing back to where he walked behind me. It was something I&#x2019;d never considered before. In my mind, everyone would want to live in the U.S. Or, well, they at least wouldn&#x2019;t want to live in Siberia. </p><p>&#x201c;All the time,&#x201d; he said, his voice a little wistful. &#x201c;Sometimes I wish&#x2014;&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Belikov!&#x201d; </p><p>A voice was carried on the wind from behind us. Dimitri muttered something, and then shoved me further around the corner I&#x2019;d just rounded. &#x201c;Stay out of sight.&#x201d; </p><p>I ducked down behind a bank of holly trees that flanked the building. They didn&#x2019;t have any berries, but the thick clusters of sharp, pointed leaves scratched where my skin was exposed. Considering the freezing temperature and possible discovery of my late-night walk, a few scratches were the least of my problems right now. </p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not on watch,&#x201d; I heard Dimitri say several moments later. </p><p>&#x201c;No, but I needed to talk to you.&#x201d; I recognized the voice.

But the reality behind the fantasy was a harsh one. Sexually abused by her father as a young girl, Rita constantly searched for a man to save her, marrying five times. At the age of forty-two, Alzheimer&#39;s disease began to ravage her mind, cutting short her career at its peak. A haunting and sympathetic tribute to the talented but insecure beauty who was created, and ultimately destroyed, by the movies.</p><p>Hayworth fans will learn much from this biography by the author of Orson Welles . The surprising story of the acutely shy Margarita Carmen Cansino, who was dubbed "the Love Goddess," contains more melodrama than most romance novels. We follow Hayworth's life from reluctant child performer to incest victim, glamour queen and wife to Orson Welles and Prince Aly Kahn. Some readers will doubtless appreciate the details of the star's sex life and inner thoughts ("as her wedding day approached, Rita grew more anxious"). Yet aside from interviews with Welles, the book is based on secondary sources and information furnished by Hayworth's secretary, publicist, studio hairdresser and makeup man. As her chronicled fights with Columbia Pictures mogul Harry Cohn and court battles over divorce and child custody attest, fame and beauty assure no happy endings. Hayworth, a long-undiagnosed victim of Alzeimer's disease, died at age 68 in 1987. 50,000 first printing; first serial to Cosmopolitan and the Star; BOMC and Time/Life Condensed Books alternates; author tour. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Hayworth made her name in films such as Cover Girl and Gilda . She also attained fame and notoriety through her marriages to Orson Welles, Prince Aly Khan, and Dick Haymes, among others. Finally she became probably the best-known victim of Alzheimer's disease. Leaming, author of well-received biographies of Welles and Roman Polanski, contends that Hayworth was sexually abused by her father. Since both the principals, and Leaming's source, Orson Welles, are all dead, the truth will never be known, but she does make a reasonably convincing case. For information on Hayworth's movies, consult John Kobal's Rita Hayworth (LJ 10/1/78); for Hayworth's life, read Leaming.<br><i>- John Smothers, Monmouth Cty.

Her disappearance would haunt her orphaned children, the perpetrators of the brutal crime and a whole society in Northern Ireland for decades.Through the unsolved case of Jean McConvilles abduction, Patrick Radden Keefe tells the larger story of the Troubles, investigating Dolours Price, the first woman to join the IRA, who bombed the Old Bailey; Gerry Adams, the politician who helped end the fighting but denied his IRA past; and Brendan Hughes, an IRA commander who broke their code of silence.

She has written more than a dozen novels and is best known for her contemporary mystery series featuring Scotland Yard's Duncan Kincaid and Gemma James. Among this series is <i>Dreaming of the Bones</i>, which was selected as one of the 100 Best Crime Novels of the Century by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association.</p>Michael Deehy's solemn voice provides a courtly eloquence to Deborah Crombie's moody police procedural. When his neighbor, Jasmine Dent, dies, Superintendent Duncan Kinkaid is not surprised since Jasmine had terminal cancer. However, when her journals are found, Duncan and his partner, Sergeant Gemma James, suspect her death was not from natural causes. As they go through the journals, Deehy's narration makes every new discovery about Jasmine's personal life fascinating. His performance gives multiple dimensions to each of the possible suspects, including Jasmine's failure of a brother, Theo; her day nurse, Felicity; her friend, Margaret; and Margaret's money-hungry boyfriend. Deehy allows Crombie's subtle clues to reveal themselves in ordinary, completely human ways. He is nicely understated as Duncan and Gemma's connection deepens and the mystery slowly unfolds.

He scored his first role in a Euripides play at 15, costarred with Katharine Hepburn at 22, and was one of two advanced-program students accepted at Juilliard, to which 2,000 drama students annually apply. (The other advanced student became his best friend, Robin Williams.) Reeve rode a sailplane to 32,000 feet over Pikes Peak, fell 90 feet from a parasail harness into four feet of water and walked away. He survived emergency appendectomy, malaria in Kenya, and the disastrous film <i>Changing Channels</i>, with Burt Reynolds. He flew vintage airplanes upside down. On his first solo transatlantic flight, a radar controller informed him he was about to run out of gas 200 miles west of Iceland. The radar controller had misread his screen, and Reeve landed safely.<p> Then, in 1995, his horse balked at a 3-foot-3-inch racecourse fence, made an abrupt "dirty stop," Reeve's hands got tangled in the reins, he landed on his head and got a "hangman's injury"--a broken neck. Ace paramedics got oxygen to him 60 seconds before brain damage set in, and a helicopter named Pegasus lofted him to a hospital.</p><p> Reeve was already important. His interpretation of <i>Superman</i> was classic, and his starring role in <i>The Bostonians</i> launched the Merchant/Ivory school of filmmaking. But it was not until his paralysis that Reeve really got moving as a public figure of the first rank. As his memoir <i>Still Me</i> details, since the accident, Reeve has directed his first film, started the Christopher Reeve Foundation to fund spinal-cord-repair research, lobbied Congress, and crisscrossed the country on speaking engagements.</p><p> Says Reeve, "Lindbergh made it across the Atlantic [where he was feted by Reeve's grandma]; Houdini got out of those straitjackets; with enough money and grass-roots support, why shouldn't I be able to get out of this wheelchair?" Part Hollywood reminiscence, part scientific detective story, and part soapbox speech, <i>Still Me</i> explains the tantalizing but quite real possiblity that Reeve (and a quarter-million other paralyzed people, plus 49 million disabled Americans) may get back on their feet. Bobby Kennedy once tried to bolster Reeve's faith by saying, "Just fake it till you make it. The prayers will seem phony, but one day they'll become real." Christopher Reeve has more than a prayer, he has a program. He ain't fake, and he just might make it, leading a cast of millions. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><b>Read what our listeners are saying . . .</b><p>Review by Frank Johnson, Audio Diversions<br> </p><p>Four years, almost to the month, after Christopher Reeve brought unwanted world-wide attention to himself and to the tiny, little known, town of Culpepper, Virginia, by falling from his horse in a jumping competition, a Random House Audio production team sat with him at his house as he read his new book <b>Still Me</b> for all to hear.</p><p>Anyone who witnessed Reeve's first public appearances after the accident will recall the tremendous effort it took for him to speak, even a few words, as the respirator pumped air in and out of his lungs. They will find it hard to believe that he could present a warm and compelling and beautifully modulated reading and sustain it for three hours of finished product. His is an extraordinary story of personal courage, determination and passion, told with charm and humor and hope.</p><p>Despite the fact that he crushed two vertebrae high on his spinal column and is paralyzed from the neck down, Reeve determined that, one day, he would walk again. Listening to this heartwarming story of his childhood, his education, including a stint studying under the famed John Houseman at Julliard, his friendship with Robin Williams, Katherine Hepburn and others and his marriage to the remarkable Dana, Reeve leaves little doubt that he will succeed.

She makes the spontaneous decision to join Eli, a fellow classmate and potential beau, in Kenya after their college graduation. Her initial impression of the country is marred by her uncomfortable journey from the airport but that changes when she is warmly welcomed by Eli's parents at their conference center, Brockhurst. Almost instantly Katie begins to fall in love with both Eli and Kenya. As her relationship with him grows, she begins to see a long-term future for herself within his family and as a contributor to the well-digging projects associated with Brockhurst. However, her faith is shaken when it becomes obvious that she and Eli have differing career interests that could lead them in opposite directions. Katie's spiritual and emotional journey is a universal one that will resonate with many teen girls. However, some readers will be turned off by outdated cultural references and word choices. Those readers will also be suspicious of the idealization of the simplicity of Kenyan culture. Christian faith and values are an overt part of the plot and provide the foundation for Katie's decisions. However, readers do not need to be versed in the Christian faith or the previous books to enjoy the romantic journey.-Lynn Rashid, Marriotts Ridge High School, Marriottsville, MD&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

It was only six o&#x2019;clock. As the hours moved toward midnight these rows would fill, and the voices speaking would grow louder to be heard, but for now many of the Members of Parliament were still attending to the chops, the pints of porter, and the ceaseless gossip of the House&#x2019;s private dining room. <br>In the front bench to the left side of the chamber sat a man with a short beard and kind, intelligent eyes, rather thinner than most gentlemen who were just beyond, as he was, the age of forty. He wore a quiet gray evening suit, and though by now many along the benches had begun to lounge backward and even, in some instances, close their eyes, his face and posture evinced no rebellion against the more or less limitless boredom that the House was capable of inflicting upon its observers. His name was Charles Lenox: Once upon a time he had been a practicing detective, and though he still kept a careful eye upon the criminal world, for some years he had been the Member of Parliament for Stirrington, and politics now comprised the chief work of his life. <br>&#x201c;Lenox?&#x201d; whispered a voice behind him. <br>He turned and saw that it was the Prime Minister. In his early days in Parliament an informal address from such a figure would have awed Lenox, but now, having moved by his own industry from the back benches to the front, he was accustomed to Disraeli&#x2019;s presence&#x2014;if perhaps not his company. Rising to an inconspicuous stoop, he said, &#x201c;Good evening, Prime Minister.&#x201d; <br>Disraeli motioned him down and sat beside him, then went on, still in a low voice, &#x201c;I cannot imagine why you have brought yourself here so early in the evening. Not to hear Swick?&#x201d; <br>Across the aisle, several rows up, a gentleman was speaking. He was Augustus Swick, a notorious crank. His speech had begun several minutes before, with the comforting assertion that in his view England had never been in a worse position. Now he had moved on to more personal issues. As he spoke, his enormous white mustache shook at its fringes. <br>&#x201c;It is 1875, gentlemen, and still I cannot walk across St. James&#x2019;s Street to the Carlton Club without being harassed by every variety of vehicle, your omnibus, your reckless hansom cab, your landau, your rapid, far too rapid, clarence&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Pierpont!&#x201d; called out a lazy voice from a back bench. <br>&#x201c;I am delighted to hear that name, sir!&#x201d; cried Swick, reddening, his brow set so grimly that this profession of delight seemed less than sincere. &#x201c;Yes, Pierpont! I had hoped his name might arise, because I must inquire of this chamber, are we all to go to private expense, as Colonel Pierpont did, to install islands in the middle of every road we wish to cross? Do every man&#x2019;s means extend so far? Can private citizens be expected to bear such a burden? I ask you, gentlemen, where will it end? Will it take a horse trampling me to death in Jermyn Street before the attention of this chamber is drawn to the problem of London&#x2019;s traffic?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;May as well try it and find out,&#x201d; called out the same voice, to mild laughter. <br>Swick, outraged, drew himself up further, and Disraeli, with a wink, took the opportunity to move to the front bench across the aisle&#x2014;for he was a Conservative, though he liked to stop in among his foes for a friendly word when the chamber was empty. He was sharp, this fellow. He had turned out Lenox&#x2019;s own party&#x2019;s leader, William Gladstone, the year before, but since then he had very carefully won around both sides of the House by tempering his imperial ambitions for England with an unexpected social conscience. Just that evening they were going to discuss the Artisans&#x2019; and Labourers&#x2019; Dwellings Improvement Act&#x2014;a bill that sounded as if it might have come from Gladstone himself. <br>In fact, this was why Lenox had come to the chamber early. He had a word to get in. <br>By the time Swick had finished speaking, ten or fifteen more men had filed into the Commons, and the serious business of the evening was near its commencement. The Speaker recognized the only man to stand after Swick&#x2014;Edward Twinkleton, a midlands glue baron. He began to address Disraeli&#x2019;s act. <br>The housing of the poor was a serious issue, perhaps the one to which Lenox had, in recent months, devoted more time than to any other. Only that morning he had driven to the slums of Hungerford to see the problem firsthand. <br>Despite its origin in his own Conservative benches, Twinkleton stood firmly against the bill and was now making a long-winded argument about the idle poor. When he had concluded, Lenox stood up and, after recognition from the Speaker, began his response. <br>&#x201c;The chief issue is not, as my honorable friend presumes, one of the comfort of our poorer citizens, but of their health. May I ask whether he is familiar with the usual, and vile, practice of the builders in these neighborhoods? Commissioned by Her Majesty&#x2019;s government to construct new edifices, they take the very fine gravel we, the taxpayers, have purchased&#x2014;for the construction of the foundation&#x2014;and they sell it on the black market. Then they replace it with something called &#x2018;dry core,&#x2019; gentlemen, a mixture of trash, dead animals, and vegetables. It is only March, but in the summer, I am informed, the smell is beyond belief. Can we rightly call this England, if Parliament gives its endorsement, this evening, to such practices?&#x201d; <br>Lenox sat down and thought he saw Disraeli incline his head slightly across the aisle in thanks&#x2014;though perhaps not. <br>Twinkleton rose. &#x201c;I commend my honorable friend&#x2019;s insight into the issue, and yet it cannot be lost on him that these people have always lived in the city, always in suchlike conditions, and that there seem to be more of them than ever! No amount of dry core reduces their number!&#x201d; <br>Lenox stood to respond. &#x201c;The honorable gentleman from Edgbaston neglects to consider, perhaps, the historical context of our time. During the period of the honorable gentleman&#x2019;s childhood&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;As I did not receive a card from my honorable friend upon the recent occasion of my birthday, I do not see how he can be so certain of my age.&#x201d; <br>This drew a laugh, but Lenox bore onward. &#x201c;During the period of the honorable gentleman&#x2019;s childhood,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;or thereabouts, one in five Britons lived in a city. Now it is edging toward four in five. Even to a very dim intellect that must be acknowledged a change.&#x201d; <br>There was laughter on Lenox&#x2019;s own side now, and a diffident round of hissing and catcalling on the other, all very usual, at this slight, and as Lenox sat down upon the green baize bench, smiling faintly, Twinkleton rose up, his face also traced with amusement, clearly raring for battle. Instead the Speaker, chary perhaps of any further devolution of courtesy in the chamber, chose to call for rebuttal on Montague, a Member from Liverpool. Twinkleton would have his chance again in a moment. In the meanwhile, Montague, who had all the charisma and verve of a dying houseplant, returned the tone of the House&#x2019;s discourse to its proper tedium. <br>When Montague had been speaking for ten minutes or so, Lenox saw that a red-haired boy was approaching him, having darted down one of the aisles. This was Frabbs, his clerk, a bright and attentive lad. He handed Lenox a note. &#x201c;Just came to the office, sir,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; said Lenox. <br>He tore the envelope and read the short note inside. Interesting. &#x201c;Any reply, sir?&#x201d; asked Frabbs. <br>&#x201c;No, but find Graham and ask him whether the vote on this bill will come in this evening, or if he thinks there will be another day of debate. You can signal me from the door, I shall keep an eye on it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; <br>Graham was Lenox&#x2019;s political secretary, his most important ally; it was a position in most instances occupied by some ambitious son of the upper classes, fresh from Charterhouse or Eton, but Graham was, unusually&#x2014;perhaps even uniquely&#x2014;a former servant. For many years he had been Lenox&#x2019;s butler. A compact, sandy-haired, and shrewd fellow, he had taken to his new position without faltering, and now had more to do with the running of Parliament than fully half of the body&#x2019;s own Members. <br>As Montague bore onward, down into the depths of his prepared remarks, Lenox&#x2019;s eyes kept flitting to the side door where Frabbs would appear. Catching himself at it once too often, he smiled: It was the old internal debate, the mild pleasures of Parliament, the sense of duty he felt to be there, laid against the thrill of being out on the hunt. Detective work. <br>Lenox&#x2019;s father had been a great man in the Commons, and now his older brother, Sir Edmund Lenox, stood among the two or three chiefs of the party. For his part, Charles had always taken a great interest in politics, too&#x2014;had sometimes wished that the seat in the family&#x2019;s bestowal, which of course Edmund took upon reaching maturity, might have been his&#x2014;and had been thrilled when he won his own. It felt like an ascent, for in truth many of his class looked upon Lenox&#x2019;s previous career as a folly, even an embarrassment. <br>How he missed the old life! Twice in the past two years he had emerged briefly from retirement, on both occasions in singular circumstances, and now he often thought of those cases, their particular details, with a longing to be back in the middle of them. No morning passed in which he did not pore over the crime columns of the newspapers, coffee growing cold in its cup. <br>He thought of all this because of the note Frabbs had passed him: It had come from his former prot�g� in detection, Lord John Dallington, asking for help on a case. Having read it ten minutes before, Lenox itched with irritation at his position already, eager to be gone from the Commons. <br>It was true that he had promised Disraeli, and several other men, that he would be an assiduous participant in these debates. Still, he had already exchanged words with Twinkleton once, and for an hour or two&#x2019;s absence anyway he would hardly be missed. Particularly if the vote was to be delayed beyond that evening. <br>Ah! There was Frabbs&#x2019;s head, popping around the doorjamb&#x2014;and yes, there was the thumb in the air. With a murmured good-bye to the men on his bench, and a promise that he would return just after the break, Lenox stood and made for the exit, happier than he had been since he left the house that morning. A strange circumstance, Dallington&#x2019;s note had promised. Lenox smiled. Who knew what might await him out there in the great fervid rousing muddle of London? <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Charles Finch</p><h2>Black Sun Rising (Coldfire)</h2><p>On the distant world of Erna, four people--Priest, Adept, Sorcerer, and Apprentice--are drawn together to battle the forces of evil, led by the demonic fae, a soul-destroying force that preys on the human mind</p><p>The Coldfire trilogy tells a story of discovery and battle against evil on a planet where a force of nature exists that is capable of reshaping the world in response to psychic stimulus.

It&#x2019;s the story of a garden revolution that began in America.<br><br>In 1733, the American farmer John Bartram dispatched two boxes of plants and seeds from the American colonies, addressed to the London cloth merchant Peter Collinson. Most of these plants had never before been grown in British soil, but in time the magnificent and colorful American trees, evergreens, and shrubs would transform the English landscape and garden forever. During the next forty years, Collinson and a handful of botany enthusiasts cultivated hundreds of American species. <i>The Brother Gardeners </i>follows the lives of six of these men, whose shared passion for plants gave rise to the English love affair with gardens. In addition to Collinson and Bartram, who forged an extraordinary friendship, here are Philip Miller, author of the best-selling <i>Gardeners Dictionary</i>; the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, whose standardized nomenclature helped bring botany to the middle classes; and Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, who explored the strange flora of Brazil, Tahiti, New Zealand, and Australia on the greatest voyage of discovery of their time, aboard Captain Cook&#x2019;s <i>Endeavour</i>.<br><br>From the exotic blooms in Botany Bay to the royal gardens at Kew, from the streets of London to the vistas of the Appalachian Mountains, <i>The Brother Gardeners</i> paints a vivid portrait of an emerging world of knowledge and of gardening as we know it today. It is a delightful and beautifully told narrative history.</p><p><b>Andrea Wulf</b> was born in India and moved to Germany as a child.

But on this January morning in 1734 he was concerned not with the arrival of reels of wool or bales of cotton but with an altogether different cargo. Awaiting him at Custom House, down by the docks, were two boxes of plants that, for Collinson, were the most exciting piece of merchandise he had ever received. &nbsp; <br><br>As he hurried towards the Thames from his Gracechurch Street office, in the financial centre of the city, Collinson could see the clusters of tall masts above the rooftops and hear the cries of stevedores as they unloaded precious goods from the holds. The stretch of the river between London Bridge and the Tower was the main harbour of London and more than two thousand vessels-besides barges, wherries and ferries-created "a forest of ships." Moored side-by-side, the vessels left only narrow channels for the barges between them, and the wharves, quays and stairs that lined the river were so crowded it was hard to move. These ships brought tea and silk from China; sugar and coffee from the West Indies; spices from the East Indies and corn and tobacco from the American colonies. The river was, as one visitor said, the "foster-mother" of London, pumping money, goods and life into a city which more than half a million people called their home-the largest metropolis in the world. &nbsp; <br><br>Collinson was one of the many merchants benefiting from the huge expansion of trade that had occurred since the accession of King George II. Soon to be forty, he had inherited the cloth business from his father a few years earlier and was involved in shipping cloth all around the globe, with his main market in the American colonies. Between the 1720s and the 1760s exports to the American colonies quadrupled, while those to the West Indies multiplied almost by seven, providing untold wealth to a new class of businessman. As Daniel Defoe wrote, "our merchants are princes, greater and richer, and more powerful than some sovereign princes." &nbsp; <br><br>And, as London grew, so too did the trade to be done within the city. In one year alone, Londoners consumed nearly 2 million barrels of beer, 15 million mackerel and 70,000 sheep. London was one vast consumer market and the streets thronged with trade. Not far from Collinson's office were the shops of Cheapside and Fleet Street, whose large windows created the impression that they were "made entirely of glass." Sweets, cakes and fruits were stacked in precarious towers, and even the apothecaries' colourful potions were lavishly displayed to entice the passers-by. Tourists wandered for hours, admiring what one called "the choicest merchandise from the four quarters of the globe." When dusk settled on the city, thousands of candles threw a soft light on to glittering jewellery, polished silverware and framed engravings. Lanterns fastened to the front of each house created a luminous necklace along the streets, giving London a permanently festive atmosphere. &nbsp; <br><br>Although Collinson was not one of the richest merchants in the city, he was very comfortably off. He lived with his beloved wife in a "little cottage" in the "pleasant village" of Peckham.* It was "the most Delightfull place to Mee," he said, where he could retreat from the "hurrys of town," and where he could indulge the great passion of his life: gardening. Collinson had been fascinated by the natural world from an early age, when he wandered the garden of his grandmother, full of topiary and "curious plants." His grandmother, who had brought him up, had encouraged his enthusiasm and taken him on many trips to the nurseries around London, in particular Fairchild's little plot in Hoxton where the adolescent Collinson had gazed in awe at the exotic world contained in the hothouses. As he got older, his interest in nature only increased. "I must be peeping about," he wrote, confessing that nature haunted him everywhere he went. &nbsp; <br><br>During the week, though, Collinson was forced to attend to his business in the City, where he felt like "a Cockney who Lives in a Wilderness of Chimneys." His main trade was with the colonies in North America, in particular with Pennsylvania, which, due to its rapid rise in population, was one of the fastest growing markets for cloth. And it was from the docks of Philadelphia that Collinson's plant boxes had been dispatched. &nbsp; <br><br>To get to the Custom House, Collinson would have hailed one of the many porters that carried busy merchants on sedan chairs to their appointments. The porters forged a path through the crowds by pushing and crying, "By your leave," and they were so fast that pedestrians who did not jump out of their way fast enough were knocked to the ground. His office was at the heart of the city, not far from the Royal Exchange, that engine of trade in whose courtyard merchants like Collinson met to sell and buy their stocks-said to be "the wealthiest corner of earth." Nearby were many coffee houses in which more business was conducted, such as Lloyd's Coffee House in Lombard Street, which became the venue for marine insurance, and the Pennsylvania Coffee House in Birchen Lane. In the latter, Collinson traded and negotiated but also heard the latest news from America, since it was frequented by captains, and visitors from the colonies who often had their lodgings there when they first arrived in London. There was hustle and noise everywhere. Shopkeepers advertised their wares, animals were herded to the slaughterhouses and musicians played at the street corners. The cacophony of voices, church bells and rattling coaches was interrupted each hour by the shouts of the watchmen who called out the time and the state of the weather. &nbsp; <br><br>The scene in the Custom House was similarly chaotic and teeming. Here, in a room that ran the whole length of the 190-foot-long building, merchants and captains as well as tourists queued for hours along the rows of counters and desks in order to retrieve their goods, trunks and luggage, and to declare their imports. Foreigners found the confusion and crowds in the so-called Long Room daunting and were shocked to see that the customs officers pocketed a share of the duty themselves. Even Collinson, who had "good friends among the Commissioners," often wasted many hours here. &nbsp; <br><br>Today, however, his patience was rewarded. Peering into the two wooden cases from Philadelphia, Collinson could hardly believe what he saw. Inside were hundreds of seeds neatly wrapped in paper, a few living plants and, most extraordinary of all, two flourishing kalmia cuttings.* Collinson had admired the kalmia's many hundred puckered pink flowers that opened like mini-umbrellas in drawings but had never seen a real one. Nobody had ever seen them growing in England, since other cuttings had never survived the journey from America, which took between five weeks and three months. &nbsp; <br><br>For a number of years now, Collinson had been using his trading connections to augment his flowerbeds with the horticultural spoils of distant countries. "Forget not Mee &amp; My Garden," he pleaded with his business partners, and occasionally, along with rolls of cloth, he might find some seeds in a little paper bag, or the remains of a shrub that had been severely neglected. Plants suffered greatly on sea voyages. Often the boxes and barrels with trees and shrubs were put on the open deck, exposed to wind, salt water and fluctuating temperatures. Rats and mice feasted on the leaves and often built their nests in the safety of the cosy boxes, while sailors helped themselves to plant water or even the rum in which choice specimens were stored. In addition, since plant boxes were the least valuable cargo on merchant ships, they were often the first freight to be jettisoned during storms or pirate attacks. One of Collinson's correspondents blamed the continuous failure to procure healthy plants on the captains, who were, according to him, so stupid that "[o]ne may as soon tutor a monkey to speak, or a French-woman to hold her tongue, as to bring a skipper to higher flights of reason." Whenever Collinson knew a passenger, he asked them to guard the boxes, thinking "it might be a pretty amusement for them to peep &amp; Look after it," but to no avail-"Hitt or Miss Lucks all," he concluded. Nine out of ten plants perished on the journey, and even fewer went on to flower once planted in English soil. &nbsp; <br><br>On this occasion, though, Collinson had been lucky. The captain had been more helpful than others and had stowed the plant boxes underneath his own bed, where they had profited from the warmth of the cabin. At last Collinson would be able to create the kind of garden he longed for, bringing a new world of plants to Britain, and so celebrate God's abundance. For Collinson, every foreign species in his garden testified to God's creation, making it akin to a horticultural bible. "[I] admire them [plants] for the sake of the Great &amp; all Wise Creator of them to Enlarge my Ideas of his Almighty power &amp; Goodness to Mankind," he said. His garden in Peckham was therefore a place of "Sublime Contemplation" through which he might discern a closer understanding of the divine plan that underpinned nature. &nbsp; <br><br>Although these ideas were widely held, they were even more pertinent to Collinson because he was a Quaker. William Penn, the founder of the Quaker settlement Pennsylvania, had already in 1693 encouraged his fellow believers to live with nature because "there we see the Works of God." Similarly, Collinson believed that plants were a direct route to a relationship with God, while other material possessions were only a pompous display of wealth-they were "Man's work" and only for "Pride, Folly and Excess," Penn had declared. Thus Collinson, who could have dressed in flamboyant and luxurious silks, favoured modest dark clothes without any of the embroidery, ribbons and ornate buttons that were so fashionable at the time. No lace was applied to his plain white shirts, nor did he wear colourful waistcoats. Equally, in his house he eschewed heavily decorated furniture or lustrous fabrics, adding colour and beauty instead with cut flowers and "nosegays." &nbsp; <br><br>As a Quaker, Collinson had been prohibited from going to university, but his enquiring mind meant that he educated himself through observation, books, and a prolific correspondence with men around the globe. In 1728, age thirty-four, he had become a fellow of the Royal Society. Collinson's annotations in the margins of his books reveal a man who engaged deeply and enthusiastically with their contents. He even used dinners served at friends' houses to broaden his knowledge, on one occasion asking Hans Sloane, the president of the Royal Society, about the classification of a fish he had eaten. He thought that a "rational pursuit" such as horticulture or natural history lead to health, pleasure and profit. Though some might consider dabbling with plants a mere amusement, Collinson believed they made men virtuous and temperate-traits that he and his faith held dear. &nbsp; <br><br>With his election as a fellow of the Royal Society, Collinson became part of the so-called "Republic of Letters" in which theories, experiments and ideas transcended national, political and religious boundaries. "I think there is no Greater pleasure then to be Communicative &amp; oblige others," Collinson encouraged one of his correspondents, adding persuasively, "Wee Brothers of the Spade find it very necessary to share among us." And to prove his commitment-with the underlying hope of receiving some American plants in return-Collinson even agreed to be the unpaid London agent for the subscription library that Benjamin Franklin and a group of friends had established in Philadelphia in 1731. Thereafter, for more than two decades, Collinson would choose, buy and ship books to Philadelphia, enlightening the learned circles in the colonies. The success of the library, Franklin later insisted, was "greatly owing to his [Collinson's] kind Countenance and good Advice." &nbsp; <br><br>As if to emphasise his primary interest, the first book Collinson had selected for the library was a horticultural publication, but despite such hints no plants had arrived. Consequently Collinson had asked the secretary of the Library Company and a fellow Quaker merchant, Joseph Breintnall, for some help. Breintnall, however, was unable to collect plants himself-or as Collinson described it, was keen "to get rid of my importunities"-but had recommended a local farmer who was known for his good knowledge of native species and who was willing to send regular floral dispatches. This man was John Bartram, the sender of the two exciting boxes. As soon as Collinson examined them, his spirits rose. He knew he was dealing with someone who understood plants and could further his aims. Bartram had, after all, been clever enough to realise that if a plant was to arrive in Britain in January, it should be of a variety that flourishes in a colder climate. &nbsp; <br><br>Like Collinson, John Bartram had adored botany since childhood and called it his "darling study," but had little time to indulge his passion since his farm on the outskirts of Philadelphia occupied almost all his time. Initially the work had involved draining the swampy ground and quarrying stone for his house; later he had to tend to his vegetables and corn. His first wife and one son had died the year he had bought his farm in 1727, but he had remarried within two years and his new wife, Ann, bore him a child roughly every two years. &nbsp; <br><br>To a man like Collinson, who spent much of his spare time at the great estates of aristocrats or meeting the intellectual elite at the Royal Society, Bartram's circumstances appeared somewhat lowly. But in fact Bartram's life was fairly privileged by colonial standards. His house, for example, unlike most colonial farm dwellings-which were one-room log cabins-was a fine stone building with four rooms. Only three years earlier, Bartram had completed it by carving a commemorative stone which read "God Save" in Greek-an indication of his aspirations and ambitions. Collinson, though, chose to believe that Bartram was a "plain Country Man," who happened to know a lot about plants and who was willing to gather seeds, acorns and cones for him on a regular basis. &nbsp; <br><br>Like Collinson, Bartram was a Quaker, his grandfather having followed William Penn to America to avoid prosecution and in hope of a better life as a colonial farmer. And as was the ethos of his religion, Bartram was unashamed of his background; he was strong-minded, unwavering in his faith and outspoken in his opinions. Such was his steadfastness that two decades later he was expelled from the Darby meeting by his fellow Quakers for insisting that Jesus was a mortal man. Despite being accused of heresy, Bartram refused to bow. &nbsp;</p><h2>Exploring World History</h2><p>Exploring World History is a high school curriculum that combines world history, literature and composition, and Bible study into one engaging course.</p><p></p><h2>Walden: Introduction and Annotations by Bill McKibben (Concord Library)</h2><p>First published in 1854, Henry David Thoreau's groundbreaking book has influenced generations of readers and continues to inspire and inform anyone with an open mind and a love of nature.

In communing with the natural world, he wished to "live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and learn what it had to teach." Toward that end Thoreau built a cabin in the spring of 1845 on the shores of Walden Pond on land owned by Ralph Waldo Emerson outside Concord, Massachusetts. There he observed nature, farmed, built fences, surveyed, and wrote in his journal.<br>One product of his two-year sojourn was this book a great classic of American letters. Interwoven with accounts of Thoreau's daily life (he received visitors and almost daily walked into Concord) are mediations on human existence, society, government, and other topics, expressed with wisdom and beauty of style.<br><i>Walden</i> offers abundant evidence of Thoreau's ability to begin with observations on a mundane incident or the minutiae of nature and then develop these observations into profound ruminations on the most fundamental human concerns. Credited with influencing Tolstoy, Gandhi, and other thinkers, the volume remains a masterpiece of philosophical reflection."</p><h2>Wood: Identification &amp; Use (Revised &amp; Expanded)</h2><p>Terry Porter&#x2019;s unique and visually dazzling handbook has always been indispensable and this new edition adds 17 species of lumber not included before, bringing the list up to a grand total of 400!

It enables us to read sealed epistles and <br>books and likewise the inner nature of man. <br></i>-Paracelsus <br>(Medieval philosopher, <br>physician, and mystic) <br> <br>Once upon a time, in the earliest eons of rational humanity, <br>there was a young man who was most discontent. Living to <br>work, raise a family, and then die did not seem fair to him. In a <br>village that prided itself on its rational and civilized manners, <br>this was quite irrational. <br>After all, of what use was it to work hard and build a good <br>life for one&#x2019;s family and never see the fruits of the labor? Once <br>death arrived, all the work on the physical plane would certainly <br>be for nothing. <br>There had to be more to life. There had to be more to the <br>universe than what abided in his village. But no one would help <br>him find the answers. No one wanted to help him search for <br>the answers. It was wrong they said. It was not for humans to <br>know the will of God. It was wrong to question. It was wrong <br>to look beyond. <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; he would ask. &#x201c;Why is it wrong to search? Why <br>was it wrong to question?&#x201d; After all, he did not want to know <br>the will of God. He merely wanted to know why his life had to <br>be limited by the village and the beliefs that he had inherited <br>from it. Certainly, there had to be more. Why did humans <br>have to struggle? Why weren&#x2019;t humans allowed to find joy and <br>enthusiasm for life and in the adventures of life? Why? <br>But no one answered. No one helped. They were content. <br>Their lives ran smoothly&#x2015;no matter how boring or limited <br>they might be. They were content, and there was no need to <br>go looking for things that may not exist. There would be no <br>shadow chasing for them. Oh, there might be some wonderful <br>things out there in the universe somewhere, but there could <br>also be some not-so-wonderful things as well. Best to leave <br>well enough alone. Best to be content with what was at hand. <br>Curiosity and the promise of dreams were strong within the <br>young man, and he set out in search of answers. He learned of <br>a wise old man who inhabited a cave at the crest of a distant <br>mountain. The man was a rumor and a legend, but as with all <br>myths, the boy knew there were elements of truth within it. <br>After many days of long climbs he reached the crest of the <br>mountain, and from this point he could see the towns and villages <br>and valleys and farms of what looked to be the whole <br>world, and he smiled. Surely, this is the place a man of wisdom <br>would choose to live! <br>As he turned from his view to seek out his teacher, he spied <br>a small cottage in the distance. Beside the cottage was a small <br>garden being tended by an old man. As the boy approached, <br>his spirits fell and his heart again ached. Before him was an old <br>man, but the old man was just that. There was no light about <br>him. There was no glow, no power that surely would emanate <br>from a true man of wisdom. There was none of this about the <br>old man. He was worn and wrinkled and looked like nothing <br>but a farmer. <br>The old man smiled and nodded in warm greeting and the <br>boy couldn&#x2019;t help but return the smile. At least he could refresh <br>himself here. The old man lay down his hoe and sat himself <br>upon a tree stump across from the boy. <br>&#x201c;What is it you seek, lad?&#x201d; <br>The boy sighed. &#x201c;I had hoped to find an answer.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I am not without a little bit of knowledge, perhaps I can <br>help you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so. I don&#x2019;t need to know of farming or tending <br>gardens. The answers I seek are more. I seek to know the <br>answer to the universe. I want to know why humans must <br>struggle. I want to know why a person cannot have what he <br>dreams of. I want to know why birds can fly and humans <br>can&#x2019;t. After all, are we not so much better than the beasts of <br>the air? I want to know. . . .&#x201d; <br>The boy rattled on, citing question after question. He didn&#x2019;t <br>know why he told all to this man, but he did. And the grizzled <br>old man sat and listened patiently, nodding now and again, but <br>saying nothing. <br>The boy&#x2019;s words became interspersed with yawns as the <br>weariness of his journey and climb began to catch up with <br>him. He did not know when exactly, but sometime during his <br>talking, he drifted off to sleep. It was deep and long, and <br>when he awoke, he was refreshed. <br>He stretched and stood and then stopped in surprise. The <br>old man was gone! And so were the cottage and the garden! He <br>spun around, looking in all directions, confused and bewildered. <br>Had he dreamed it all? Had he imagined it all? <br>All that remained was the tree stump. Upon the stump <br>were two scrolls. The boy picked them up gently and glanced <br>about him as if someone were watching from behind a bush. <br>There was no one. He unrolled a scroll and read: <br>Son, <br>There is much to learn and an eternity to learn it, but before <br>we can learn the new, we must unlearn the old. Hold on to <br>your questions, for with the asking of the question we have <br>the beginning of the answer. <br>To you I bequeath this second scroll. It is a map of the <br>universe and all that resides within and without it. You may <br>notice that it appears quite simple, but this is the first that <br>must be unlearned. It is in the simple that the great can be <br>found. Intricacies complicate and confuse. <br>Build your universe from a simple and yet strong foundation. <br>You are surprised that I say &#x201c;build.&#x201d; But that is what you <br>will be doing, for as you discover the universe, you will recreate <br>your own. <br>You will notice that the directions are simple and rational, <br>a term you disfavor, but it must be. As much as you disfavor <br>the rational, it is a part of your makeup. It is a tool with which <br>you will be able to grow and understand. Remember that it <br>is only in its unbalanced state that the world becomes barren. <br>Be true to yourself and to the knowledge contained herein. <br>Herein lies the foundation to live in light, grow in wisdom and <br>express with love. It is for you as it is for all humankind who <br>wish to remove their self-imposed blinders and discover the <br>Hidden Light behind all lights. <br>In Love and wisdom, <br><i>Your First Answer <br></i>Overwhelmed, the boy sat down and began to read the <br>second scroll. He savored it; he studied it and time lost all <br>meaning. He now stood upon the brink of a new world. He <br>had found what had been hidden . . . <br><i>(To be continued) <br></i>Mention the word &#x201c;occult&#x201d; and people call to mind images <br>of spell casting, devil worship, Halloween, evil witchcraft, and <br>bizarre happenings behind closed doors. To mention that you <br>are a student of the occult is to invite an often rude awakening <br>as to whom your true friends are. In reality, it is merely a sixletter <br>word, derived from the Greek language, meaning &#x201c;hidden.&#x201d; <br>It refers to the hidden knowledge, mysteries, and truths <br>of God and life. It is neither sinful nor demonic in itself. It is <br>simply veiled knowledge, so as to allow man the opportunity <br>to seek and grow and mature enough to use it responsibly in <br>its highest capacity. <br>There are those who argue that such knowledge is hidden <br>and obscured because God does not want humans to discover <br>it. If that were the case, the alphabet, algebra, and electricity <br>would be just as &#x201c;demonic&#x201d; as other so-called &#x201c;occult&#x201d; ideas <br>and truths. They were understood by relatively few, but no <br>one today would deny their usefulness. The Master Jesus <br>stated, &#x201c;Things are hidden only to be revealed at a later time&#x201d; <br>(Mark 4:22). The knowledge is obscure because the majority <br>refuses the discipline and dedication necessary to seek it out, <br>much less to attempt an understanding of it. <br>It is unfortunate that the term has acquired such a strong, <br>negative connotation. There are now those who attribute any <br>outbreak of trouble to that unknown nemesis known as the <br>&#x201c;occult.&#x201d; When there is disruption or disintegration in the <br>ranks of religious groups, it must either be an occult attack <br>from outside the group or the retaliation of some &#x201c;occult&#x201d; <br>forces of evil with which they have been waging daring battles. <br>It is the stuff of fiction! <br>Humankind has made great progress technologically. Physically, <br>we are stronger and healthier. Mentally, we are sharper <br>and expanding, but spiritually, as a whole, we are stagnant. Our <br>knowledge has outstripped our spiritual teachings. They are <br>growing incompatible. Without the expansion of our spiritual <br>understanding, the gap can only widen. Simple conformity with <br>approved theological institutions no longer satisfies. There is an <br>increasing need for a more personal and complete, spiritual <br>experience. <br>All major religions teach that we are to return to some &#x201c;primal <br>point&#x201d; from which we came. Some call this heaven, some <br>nirvana. This ultimate of experiences is called Divine Union, <br>but other than teaching church doctrines and moral codes, the <br>major religions are not teaching the extent to which we can <br>manifest this link while in the physical. They do not teach the <br>extent to which we progress through a natural course of <br>evolvement&#x2015;as if progressing through a school&#x2015;accumulating <br>greater skills, abilities, and knowledge to assist us in our life. <br>They do not teach the practical means to enhance and accelerate <br>this natural course of evolvement, of expanding our spiritual <br>knowledge and applying it to all aspects of life. They do not <br>teach how to make use of the so-called metaphysical gifts as a <br>working aspect of our daily life. <br>In every person, the qualities essential for accelerating this <br>spiritual evolution are innate. Within each of us are gifts and <br>potentials that we can use to enhance our lives. Whether we <br>call these psychic gifts, metaphysical powers, miracles of life, <br>or spiritual wonders does not matter. They exist within each <br>of us, but even people who recognize these potentials need an <br>effective means of unfolding them. There needs to be a system <br>that allows us to recognize and then utilize all of the spiritual <br>potential within us. <br>For any such system to be of true benefit to all, it must be <br>easily understood&#x2015;at least in its most basic form and conception. <br>It must be a living and growing system that allows itself <br>to be adapted to each individual and his or her particular stage <br>of unfoldment while holding its basic, primary form and content. <br>It should awaken our inherent abilities and open the <br>doors to our higher conscious. It should enable us to feel and <br>experience increasingly the universal forces operating within <br>it. The practices, energies and forces within the system should <br>be such that they can be experienced in a manner that encourages <br>continued pursuit, inspiration and exploration throughout <br>its use. <br>The mystical Qabala is just such a system. It is one of the <br>most esoteric, occult, and yet practical systems for expanding <br>our consciousness and unfolding our spiritual gifts and awareness. <br>It has been called the Western Tradition of Occultism, <br>and within it lies the wisdom of the ancients and all of the <br>powers of the universe. Within it lies the means to contact <br>those divine powers and be touched by them. Through it, one <br>can go as far and as deeply into the mysteries of life as one <br>desires. It is especially suited to the rational Western mind <br>because it is a system that allows us to see some organization <br>of the powers and energies of the universe and how they play <br>upon each of us as individuals and as a group. <br>Qabala comes from the ancient word <i>qibel </i>which means <br>&#x201c;to receive&#x201d; or &#x201c;that which is received.&#x201d; In the ancient world it <br>had a more general meaning of &#x201c;the law.&#x201d; It is the earliest <br>form of Jewish mysticism. There are many stories of how it <br>came to be. Most claim that it was the knowledge given to <br>Moses on Mount Sinai during the episode of the burning <br>bush. Another version says that it was taught by God to the <br>Angels who formed a school based upon it in paradise. After <br>man&#x2019;s fall, the Angels passed it on to the children of the earth <br>so that they may again overcome the earth plane and ascend <br>to the heavens. <br>It is told that the Archangel Metatron gave the Qabala to <br>Adam, who in turn passed it on down to Noah and then to Abraham. <br>When Abraham emigrated to Egypt, a portion of it leaked <br>out. Thus the Egyptians obtained greater spiritual and mystical <br>knowledge (along with other Eastern nations) that assisted them <br>in establishing one of the greatest civilizations in the history of <br>humankind. <br>In this version, Moses, who was first initiated into its uses <br>by the Egyptians, became quite proficient in it during his <br>forty years in the desert. Tradition states that during this time <br>he received more instruction in it from the Angels and used it <br>to overcome many of the difficulties in the desert. The &#x201c;mannah <br>from heaven&#x201d; is attributed to his knowledge of the <br>Qabala. He passed it on to the elders who in turn passed it on <br>from generation to generation by word of mouth. David and <br>Solomon were probably the most deeply initiated into its wisdom <br>and mysteries. <br>The modern Qabala is a mixture of the Jewish Qabala and <br>the core ideas of the most ancient Egyptian religion that led <br>to illumination. It has been found in the Chaldean religion. It <br>was a part of the teachings of Pythagoras, and Jesus made <br>numerous references to it. The phrasing of the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer <br>is very Qabalistic in itself. <br>Even with its ancient origins it is still a very living system <br>of evolvement. Its uses and interpretations vary, expand and <br>adapt from generation to generation. Its foundations are firm, <br>but its uses involve changes that meet and coordinate with the <br>outside world. It is a changing system, but changing only in <br>that it grows and expands. Since there can be no growth without <br>change, this is quite appropriate. It is studied and used to <br>initiate change within ourselves and thus also within our environment. <br>Change does not come from life itself, but from living <br>that life and by acting upon and within it. The Qabala <br>assists in this. <br>Today&#x2019;s student of the Qabala must reinterpret the doctrines <br>and reformulate methods in the light of modern knowledge <br>if it is to be of use. The purity of a tradition or idea must <br>be tested if it is to have any life in it. Dead doctrines and faith <br>never ensure belief. Tradition is fine, but to let it rule to the <br>exclusion of new growth is a denial of the basic tenets of a <i>living <br>system. </i>Any tree is a living, growing thing, and if alive, <br>implied within it is change. All tools and teachings are capable <br>of being changed and extended beyond their first applications. <br>The Qabala is a plan for a flower garden. Provided are the <br>tools, the tasks, the sunshine, the water, the fertilizer, and seed <br>enough for infinite plant life. Provided are the instructions and <br>procedures for the planting, hoeing, and harvesting. But with <br>all this, the actual work is up to the individual. No other system <br>is as complete in providing the energy, inspiration, confirmation, <br>and greater realization of mystical experience. It will <br>even go so far as to point out where the weeds are, but the task <br>of pulling them is still ours. That choice is always ours. <br>&#x201c;We are the masters of our own destiny.&#x201d; Working with <br>the Qabala m...</p><h2>Spiritual Friendship: Finding Love in the Church as a Celibate Gay Christian</h2><p>Friendship is a relationship like no other. Unlike the relationships we are born into, we choose our friends. It is also tenuous--we can end a friendship at any time. But should friendship be so free and unconstrained? Although our culture tends to pay more attention to romantic love, marriage, family, and other forms of community, friendship is a genuine love in its own right. This eloquent book reminds us that Scripture and tradition have a high view of friendship. Single Christians, particularly those who are gay and celibate, may find it is a form of love to which they are especially called.<br><br>Writing with deep empathy and with fidelity to historic Christian teaching, Wesley Hill retrieves a rich understanding of friendship as a spiritual vocation and explains how the church can foster friendship as a basic component of Christian discipleship. He helps us reimagine friendship as a robust form of love that is worthy of honor and attention in communities of faith. This book sets forth a positive calling for celibate gay Christians and suggests practical ways for all Christians to cultivate stronger friendships.</p><p><b>Retrieving a Rich Understanding of Spiritual Friendship<br></b><br>"Courageous and thought provoking.

In preparing the second edition of <i>Engineering a Compiler</i>, we focused on the usability of the book, both as a textbook and as a reference for professionals. Specifically, we:</p> <ul> <li>Improved the flow of ideas to help the student who reads the book sequentially. Chapter introductions explain the purpose of the chapter, lay out the major concepts, and provide a high-level overview of the chapter&#x2019;s subject matter. Examples have been reworked to provide continuity across chapters. In addition, each chapter begins with a summary and a set of keywords to aid the user who treats <i>Engineering a Compiler</i> as a reference book.</li> <li>Added section reviews and review questions at the end of each major section. The review questions provide a quick check as to whether or not the reader has understood the major points of the section.</li> <li>Moved definitions of key terms into the margin adjacent to the paragraph where they are first defined and discussed.</li> <li>Revised the material on optimization extensively so that it provides broader coverage of the possibilities for an optimizing compiler.</li> </ul> <p>Compiler development today focuses on optimization and on code generation. A newly hired compiler writer is far more likely to port a code generator to a new processor or modify an optimization pass than to write a scanner or parser. The successful compiler writer must be familiar with current best-practice techniques in optimization, such as the construction of static single-assignment form, and in code generation, such as software pipelining. They must also have the background and insight to understand new techniques as they appear during the coming years.</p> <p>Finally, they must understand the techniques of scanning, parsing, and semantic elaboration well enough to build or modify a front end. Our goal for the second edition of <i>Engineering a Compiler</i> has been to create a text and a course that exposes students to the critical issues in modern compilers and provides them with the background to tackle those problems. We have retained, from the first edition, the basic balance of material. Front ends are commodity components; they can be purchased from a reliable vendor or adapted from one of the many open-source systems. At the same time, optimizers and code generators are custom-crafted for particular processors and, sometimes, for individual models, because performance relies so heavily on specific low-level details of the generated code. These facts affect the way that we build compilers today; they should also affect the way that we teach compiler construction.</p> <b>Read a Sample Chapter from <i>Engineering a Compiler</i> on "Practical Issues"</b><br> <p>Even with automatic parser generators, the compiler writer must manage several issues to produce a robust, efficient parser for a real programming language.

It has been said that the miracle is not to fly in the air or walk on the water but to walk on earth, a lesson that a few like Arthur Boyle feel fortunate to have learned.&#x201d;&nbsp; &#x2014;Charlie Gibson, <i>Good Morning America</i><br><br>&#x201c;To most folks, it was Tiger Woods who made 2000 the year of the miracle in the golf world. I beg to differ. I know a low-handicap, tournament golfer named Artie Boyle, who is part of something that seems bigger than any of Woods&#x2019; major victories and link heroics. Deep in Boyle&#x2019;s heart and soul, he knows he is the beneficiary of an actual miracle.&#x201d;&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>Boston Herald</i><br><br>&#x201c;After learning he had advanced lung and kidney cancer, Artie Boyle traveled to Bosnia and Herzegovina to the pilgrimage site Medjugorje with [Rob] Griffin and his brother-in-law, Kevin Gill.&nbsp;[...] A little more than a week later, Artie Boyle showed up at Massachusetts General Hospital for a meeting with his doctors before a scheduled operation. Judy Boyle requested one last scan&#x2014;and it showed no evidence of cancer.&#x201d;&nbsp; &#x2014;Peter May, <i>New York Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Six Months to Live</i> follows three regular guys on a desperate life-saving journey. Filled with remarkable discoveries, it&#x2019;s an unforgettable story of friendship, hope and unshakable faith. Get ready to believe in miracles.&#x201d;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x2014;Mary Lou Quinlan, author, New York Times bestseller, <i>The God Box: Sharing My Mother&#x2019;s Gift of Faith, Love and Letting Go</i><br><br>&#x201c;In a day and age when mankind relies heavily on technology to provide for his needs, Artie Boyle had no choice but to rely on his faith. Stricken with terminal cancer and out of medical options, this father of thirteen traveled to a distant land to ask for a miracle. [...] Artie&#x2019;s remarkable and miraculous journey will warm your heart and rekindle your faith.&#x201d;&nbsp; &#x2014;Jack Sacco, award-winning author, <i>Where the Birds Never Sing</i> and <i>Above the Treetops</i><br><br>&#x201c;A chance conversation in a hockey rink leads to a life-changing experience for Artie and his friends. Having known the Boyle family for many years I am certain that his story will be an inspiration to anyone who reads this book.&#x201d; &#x2014;Bobby Orr, NHL Hall of Fame member and author, <i>Orr: My Story</i><br><br><p>&#x201c; [...] One of the most important lessons Artie beautifully communicates as you follow his healing journey is the need for men to be intimately involved in the spiritual leadership of their families. His words and story of an impossible healing will not only stay with you for a very long time, but challenge you to the person God called you to be.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jim Caviezel, star, <i>The Passion of the Christ</i>, CBS <i>Person of Interest<br></i></p><br><br>&#x201c;Artie has captured his powerful story of healing and conversion in this wonderful book. If you&#x2019;ve ever wondered about the power of faith, his testimony will take your breath away. It proves that nothing is impossible with God.&#x201d; &#x2014;Ray Flynn, former U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican and former Mayor of Boston<br><br>&#x201c;With the severity and progression of Artie&#x2019;s disease, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, it is difficult for medical science to explain why he is alive today. But, every time I see him, I am sure there is a God. This story proves there is always hope. I am a believer.&#x201d; &#x2014;Francis James McGovern, M.D., Massachusetts General Hospital<br><br>&#x201c;The minute I started reading <i>Six Months to Live</i>, I got total body chills, and they kept coming&#x2014;a sure sign that this book is full of the truth about healing and miracles.

Combined with this problem is the discipleship deficit, the difficult truth that most evangelicals are not reaching the unchurched at the rates they think they are. In fact, many of the metrics that we often "count" in the church to highlight success really don't tell us the full story of a church's spiritual state. Things like attendance, decisions, dollars, and experiences can tell us something about a church, but not everything.</p><p>To cultivate a spiritually healthy church we need a shift in our metrics--a "grace-shift" that prioritizes the work of God in the lives of people over numbers and dollars. Are people growing in their esteem for Jesus? Is there a dogged devotion to the Bible as the ultimate authority for life? Is there a growing interest in theology and doctrine? A discernible spirit of repentance? And perhaps most importantly, is there evident love for God and for our neighbors in the congregation?</p><p>Leading a church culture to shift from numerical success to the metrics of grace can be costly, but leaders who have conviction, courage, and commitment can lead while avoiding some of the landmines that often destroy churches. Wilson includes diagnostic questions that will help leaders measure--and lead team transparency in measuring as a group--the relative spiritual health of their church, as well as a practical prescriptive plan for implementing this metric-measuring strategy without becoming legalistic.</p><p>Most attractional church models can lean heavily on making changes to the weekend worship gatherings. And while some of these changes can be good, thriving grace-focused churches are driven by a commitment to the gospel, allowing the gospel to inform and shape the worship service and the various ministries of the church.</p></p><p>"In&nbsp;<i>The Gospel-Driven Church</i>, my friend Jared Wilson encourages us to consider the full weight of the gospel as the driver of the local church rather than metrics that can be helpful but don't tell the whole story. By changing the driver to the gospel we are able to change the movement from 'come and see' to 'go and tell.' This book should soothe&nbsp;&nbsp;weary leaders' bones and free them to point freely and passionately to the beauty of Jesus' life, death and resurrection."<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Matt Chandler</b>, Lead Pastor of The Village Church, Flower Mound, TX and President of the Acts29 Network<br>&nbsp;<br>"Wilson's understanding of church history, theology, and pastoral ministry are combined with his passion for the gospel and the local church in this helpful and insightful book. While there continues to be a desire to 'change the scorecard,' he paints a picture of what that looks like for ministry leaders. A must read for those in ministry leadership."<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Eric Geiger</b>, Senior Pastor of Mariners Church, Irvine, CA<br>&nbsp;<br><i>"The Gospel-Driven Church</i>&nbsp;serves as a sobering reminder that a growing attendance does not necessarily mean a growing number of disciples of Jesus. In this book, Wilson gives an honest assessment of the modern church and a solid argument for why we need to adjust our idea of how to measure a healthy church. Pastors would greatly benefit from using this tool to make sure their church is moving in the right direction."<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Robby Gallaty</b>, Senior Pastor of Long Hollow Baptist Church, Hendersonville, TN and Founder of Replicate Ministries<br>&nbsp;<br>"With humor, wisdom and an easy, but challenging writing style, Jared Wilson has offered a much-needed wake up call to the American Church. Whether you're a church planter, a pastor or simply a Christian who desires to see your church become as healthy as possible,&nbsp;<i>The Gospel-Driven Church</i>&nbsp;serves as a road map to help shake off the shackles of 'cultural relevance' and transform our churches into what God has always intended them to be."<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Matt Carter</b>, Pastor of Preaching at The Austin Stone Community Church, Austin, TX<br>&nbsp;<br>"Jared Wilson contends that many churches remain unconsciously in the grip of the attractional worldview. Freedom comes by fearless inventory and swapping out the metrics by which we measure success. As one expects, Wilson is clear, winsome, and pulls no punches. Church leader, if you are looking to understand how God evaluates your hard work and whether it will produce lasting fruit, buy this book!"<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Dave Harvey</b>,&nbsp;President of Sojourn Network, Teaching Pastor at Summit Church, Fort Myers, FL<br>&nbsp;<br>"Jared has put into words what so many of us have felt in our guts. This book is the magna carta for gospel-centered change."<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Clint Pressley</b>, Senior Pastor of Hickory Grove Baptist Church, Charlotte, NC<br>&nbsp;<br>"Wilson's book <i>The&nbsp;Prodigal Church</i>&nbsp;helped us see the problem of pragmatism in the attractional church. 'If it works, then work it' doesn't work anymore (if it ever did!). Multiplying noses and nickels doesn't equal faithfulness or fruitfulness. Now<i>&nbsp;</i>he offers some practical solutions to 'put the gospel in the driver's seat.' If you're convinced that the church needs more gospel and less gimmickry. If you want less Christian 'do's' and more of Christ's 'done' in your preaching. If you want the gospel to be more than a tagline at the end of message and more of an ecosystem at the center of church life, then&nbsp;<i>The Gospel-Driven Church</i>&nbsp;will help you get there."<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Chris Lewis</b>, Lead Pastor of Foothill Church, Glendora, CA<br>&nbsp;<br>"It's not enough to embrace the gospel. Our churches need to be shaped by the gospel. If you want to understand how to make this transition, you will love this book. I'm grateful for Jared's theological and pastoral wisdom. I wish I could have read this book twenty years ago."<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Darryl Dash</b>, Pastor of Liberty Grace Church, Toronto, Canda, Author of&nbsp;<i>How to Grow: Applying the Gospel to ALL of Life</i><br>&nbsp;<br>"After twenty-five years of church ministry as a gospel loving evangelical, I found&nbsp;<i>The Gospel-Driven Church</i>&nbsp;personally timely, challenging, and stimulating. This book<i>&nbsp;</i>is a call to the entertainment-addicted, consumeristic church culture of the West to abandon its growth fetish and re-center on the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ."<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Steve Jeffrey</b>, Senior Minister at St. Paul's Church, Sydney, Australia<br>&nbsp;<br><i>&nbsp;</i><p>Jared C.

Bambi is torn between his desire to be with his beloved mate, Faline, and his yearning for the knowledge and solitude the prince represents.

A barefoot, grimy boy walks past, a very little boy, maybe between three and four years old. He's eating a bun. Behind him trails a skinny puppy, itself very young. </p> <p> The boy turns around, sees the dog, and raises a threatening fist. The dog cowers dramatically, cringing to the ground. The boy looks up with a huge, triumphant grin: "I scared the heck out of him, didn't I!" He walks on down the road. The puppy gets up and slinks after him -- and guess what: the boy has forgotten about the bun. He lets it fall, and the puppy grabs it and runs away. </p> <p> That's how we've dealt with domestic animals ever since we and they evolved together. We treat them like subordinate, stupid human beings. We dominate them. We punish them. We make them do what we want. And they figure out how to get us to do what they want, anyway. Both sides get some benefit out of the system: in this case, food for the skinny puppy, and a rare moment of superiority for a small boy. </p> <p> Traditionally the person who actually <i>trains</i> animals, beyond these ordinary practices of threatening them one minute and feeding them the next, has always been a special individual. Often it's someone with a "way with animals," a "natural gift." Usually that gift consists of two things: a personal interest in some particular kind of animals (dog trainers train dogs; horse trainers train horses) and a better understanding than the rest of us of the subtle uses of fear and force. </p> <p> Traditional animal training, the way it's been practiced for millennia, relies largely on force, intimidation, and pain. While traditional trainers may also use praise and rewards, dominating the animal and obtaining control over its behavior are the main goals, and the main tools are fear and pain. </p> <p> Traditional trainers are abundant among us. Nowadays of course they justify their practices with pseudoscientific explanations about pack leadership and the importance of dominance and of being the alpha animal; but the basic method, in spite of the overlay, is punishment; and people generally accept that approach. Most horse owners still keep whips and spurs in the barn. The walls in pet stores are plastered with choke chains and the aisles lined with shock collars, and people buy them. Maybe you use them yourself. I won't argue with you. Force and intimidation have been working for people since the first dogs hung around the first campfires (or, more likely, around the first garbage dumps). </p> <p> But that's all obsolete now. Now we have a new way of dealing with animals. Out of real science we've developed a training technology. Like any good technology it's a system that anyone can use. The basics are easy to learn. It works with <i>all</i> animals (and that includes people). It's fast. What used to take months, the traditional way, can now happen in minutes. It's completely benign; punishment and force are never part of the learning system. And it produces real communication between two species. <br> <br> </p> <b>D'Artagnan the Wolf</b> <br> <p> Erich Klinghammer, a professor at Purdue University, is a well-known ethologist. He is the founder of a research facility in Indiana called Wolf Park. Dr. Klinghammer came across my book <i>Lads Before the Wind,</i> which describes the years in which I worked as head dolphin trainer at a pioneering oceanarium, Sea Life Park, in Hawaii. Klinghammer saw that the technology we used for training dolphins would be useful for managing wolves. He invited me to Wolf Park to show his team how to do it. </p> <p> We modern trainers love the chance to work with a new species. Not just one more dog or horse or dolphin, but something we have never trained before. We begin, always, with curiosity: "Who are you? What can you do? Show me." I had never worked with wolves, so of course I said yes. </p> <p> A few weeks later I fly to Indiana. At Wolf Park, Erich Klinghammer is eager to have me go into the pens and meet some wolves personally, to "experience their boisterousness." This I am not willing to do. Klinghammer is six feet four with a big Germanic bass voice. He walks through the gate into the main pack's enclosure and booms, "Good morning, wolves!" The wolves gather around him, waving their tails and jumping up to greet him: "Good morning, Dr. Klinghammer!" For me, I think it would be "Good morning, breakfast." </p> <p> Besides, I don't need to be close to a wolf to work the training magic; in fact, both of us are safer and will feel better with a fence between us. This wonderful technology does not depend on my being able to impress or dominate the wolf. Nor does it depend on making friends first, or on having a "good relationship." That's often a happy outcome, but it's not a requirement: the laws of reinforcement will get the job done. </p> <p> Klinghammer has selected a large male, D'Artagnan, as my learner. That's a typical wolf name; no one calls wolves Pete or Blackie or Pal. D'Artagnan was raised by humans, so he does not know how to get along with other wolves and has to live alone in a pen on the far side of the park. Klinghammer and I jump into a truck with a couple of students and a large can of dry dog food and drive to D'Artagnan's pen. I get out my dolphin trainer's whistle, pick up the can of kibble, and go over to the chain-link fence. Wolves look a lot like dogs in paintings and even in photographs, but in real life they're quite different. For one thing they don't have pointed ears like a German shepherd, but small, round ears, like a bear; for another, they don't smell like dogs, they smell like fur rugs. </p> <p> D'Artagnan meets me with a spectacular threat display, snarling, snapping, and lunging at the chain-link fence between us. He is about the size of a St. Bernard but with much wider jaws and bigger teeth, especially the bone-crunching carnassials in back, at which I am getting a really good look. </p> <p> I'm sure this show of aggression is learned behavior. His hackles are not up, his eye whites are not showing; he's not really that upset. However, he has probably discovered he can sometimes make people flinch, or even run away, by being scary; and that must be fun to do. </p> <p> The first step toward change is to explain to the wolf that when he hears the whistle, food will arrive. I blow the whistle and throw in some kibble. D'Artagnan just goes on snarling and leaping and snapping at my face. The chain-link fence between us suddenly seems flimsy. I don't want to reinforce his behavior by moving away, but it is indeed difficult to just stand there. </p> <p> A Jeep full of volunteers and students pulls up. The wolf is quiet for an instant, studying the Jeep. I whistle and toss more kibble through the fence right under his nose. "Oh," he says, and vacuums up the food. I whistle and toss kibble again. Again he eats the kibble. Then he looks at me. I do nothing. He turns away. Good! It's a relief to see the back of that wolf. </p> <p> So far, I've just paired the whistle with the food, to make it a "conditioned reinforcer," a sound that means "food is coming." I'm now going to start using the whistle to identify for the wolf what action he's getting paid for. This will turn the sound into an event marker (usually just called a marker). So I whistle as he moves away, and toss in more treats. He returns and eats again. </p> <p> Now that the wolf is listening to the whistle, coming back for more food when he hears it, and has been reinforced for moving away, I can begin "shaping" his behavior. <i>Shaping</i> is the technical term for shifting a behavior by reinforcing any moves that happen to occur in the direction you have in mind and ignoring everything else. </p> <p> In the middle of D'Artagnan's big enclosure, about thirty feet off, stands a small evergreen tree. I tell the watchers, "I'm going to train him to go out and around that tree and come back." Bravado, of course. I'm going to try would be a wiser promise; but even if it only works for part of the way, it's a useful demonstration. Using a marker signal to shape the behavior of going away from the food, in order to earn the food, helps to shut up the skeptics. </p> <p> I mark each time the wolf turns away from me, timing my whistle to the stepping of his right front paw. Every time he hears the whistle, I toss in a lump or two of kibble. He snatches them up and then, with increasing confidence, turns and starts moving directly away from me again. </p> <p> I wait for three strides before I give the whistle, then five, then ten. Now D'Artagnan is so confident he grabs up the kibble and actually trots off, still chewing. Each time, I wait to blow the whistle until he's gone farther than before. Now he's going more than halfway to the little tree. </p> <p> Then, on the next try, he stops before I blow the whistle. Uh-oh. He is new to the game and hasn't had enough experience to know that a missed marker doesn't mean the game is over, but simply means that you should try again. If I give him a whistle while he is standing still, he might develop the behavior of going out just that far and stopping. And if I don't give him a whistle at all, he might quit altogether. I watch him, praying he'll take another step forward so I can reinforce moving, not just standing. </p> <p> Instead, he turns around and makes eye contact with me. His yellow eyes look into mine with a focus so intense that it feels as if he were seeing right into my brain -- which, in a way, he is. That penetrating stare is literally breathtaking: I hold my breath and look steadily back. </p> <p> Deciding, I think, that the game is still on, D'Artagnan turns away from me and heads straight off toward the tree again, breaking into a canter for the first time. I blast the whistle to mark that bold decision. His loping stride brings him abreast of the little evergreen. The wolf wheels around the tree and comes back down the other side at a gallop, screeching to a halt right in front of me, making my brag come true. Quit while y...</p></p><h2>Oxford Beginner&#39;s Japanese Dictionary (Multilingual Edition)</h2><p>Each <em>Oxford Beginner's Bilingual Dictionary</em> is designed to offer English speaking adult learners a comprehensive, straightforward introduction to foreign languages, covering all the vocabulary needed for the first years of study, along with notes on grammar and usage and guidance on the culture where the language is spoken.<br><br>These easy to use references break from standard dictionary design.

His numerous books have sold 1.7 million copies, and he has trained thousands of counselors in his Choice Theory and Reality Therapy approaches. He is also the president of the William Glasser Institute in Los Angeles.</p>The backlash may be on. Turn away from ``organic psychiatry,'' urges Glasser (Choice Theory, 1998, etc.); help patients with mental illness accept that they are responsible for their behavior; and drastically reduce our reliance on medications for treating mental illness. Joined by a growing crowd (Peter Breggin, for instance, and Schaler, below), Glasser reiterates his opposition to the theory that mental illness is caused by chemical imbalances in the brain. Instead, he insists that ``what is labeled mental illness . . . are the hundreds of ways people choose to behave when they are unable to satisfy basic genetic needs, such as love and power.'' He interprets brain scan research to show that as patients work in (non-drug) therapy, they begin to make better choices in life, and that as a result, brain chemistry changes. This collection of case histories and commentary ranges over marital discord, panic attacks, alcoholism, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia. Glasser demonstrates how he conducts therapy that helps patients take responsibility for their actions, gradually find better ways to meet their needs, and change inappropriate patterns of behavior. He is generally against ``external control psychology,'' arguing again that patients must learn to control themselves. Though his views are sometimes remote from the current mainstream (``A major purpose of all psychological symptoms is to get sympathy and attention''), he makes a cogent case for his dissent. For those looking for a new view of psychology and psychiatry, either for personal help or to follow the current state of the art. -- <i>Copyright �2000, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Acclaimed historian Andrea Wulf describes how George Washington wrote letters to his estate manager even as British warships gathered off Staten Island; how a tour of English gardens renewed Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s and John Adams&#x2019;s faith in their fledgling nation; and why James Madison is the forgotten father of environmentalism. Through these and other stories, Wulf reveals a fresh, nuanced portrait of the men who created our nation.</p></p><p><p><b>Andrea Wulf</b> was born in India and moved to Germany as a child.

We drove hundreds of miles on roads that never curved, along a grid that mankind had imposed on nature. Some days we passed sprawling factories that were pumping out clouds of billowing smoke; other days we saw vast fields that seemed to go on forever. Everything differed in scale from Europe, even suburban America, where rows and rows of painted clapboard houses sit proudly on large open plots of immaculately shorn lawns. America exuded a confidence that seemed to be rooted in its power to harness nature to man&#x2019;s will and I thought of it as an industrial, larger- than- life country. I certainly never thought of it in terms of gardening&#x2014; whereas in Britain, everybody seems to be obsessed with their herbaceous borders and vegetable plots. In America, I believed, I was more likely to see someone driving a riding mower than pruning roses.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then, in 2006, I went to visit Monticello, Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s mountaintop home in Virginia, and began to understand how wrong I had been. On a sunny October morning, I stood on Jefferson&#x2019;s vegetable terrace, with straight lines of cabbages and squashes at my feet, and saw man and nature in perfect harmony. In the distance the horizon seemed to stretch into infinity; behind me was a manicured lawn lined with ribbons of flowers and, below, a romantic forest that crept into the gardens. The magnificent view from the terrace across the arboreal sea of autumnal reds and oranges of red maples, oaks, hickories and tulip poplars brought together Jefferson&#x2019;s neat plots of cultivated vegetables and sublime scenery of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Jefferson had combined beauty with utility, the untamed wilderness of the forest with the orderly lines of apples, pears and cherries in the orchard, and colorful native and exotic flowers with a sweeping panorama across Virginia&#x2019;s spectacular landscape. If nature had been dominated by man, it seemed it was only in order to celebrate it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Later, I couldn&#x2019;t put Monticello out of my mind. I was in the midst of writing about the eighteenth- century American farmer and plant collector John Bartram, the British obsession with gardens and the introduction of non-native plants into the English landscape&#x2014;many of which had been sent by Bartram from the American colonies. The more I learned about Bartram, the more fascinated I became by the American relationship to nature during the eighteenth century.<br> &nbsp;<br> I pored over the correspondence between John Bartram and Benjamin Franklin, and after my visit to Monticello, I learned that Thomas Jefferson and George Washington had also ordered plants from Bartram, and that James Madison had visited Bartram&#x2019;s garden just before the Great Compromise of the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787. I read in John Adams&#x2019;s diaries how much he enjoyed working in his garden, fork in hand. Slowly, through records, letters and diaries, I came to see how vegetable plots, ornamental plants, landscapes and forests had played a crucial role in America&#x2019;s struggle for national identity and in the lives of the founding fathers. Golden cornfields and endless rows of cotton plants became symbols for America&#x2019;s economic independence from Britain; towering trees became a reflection of a strong and vigorous nation; native species were imbued with patriotism and proudly planted in gardens, while metaphors drawn from the natural world brought plants and gardening into politics.<br> &nbsp;<br> The founding fathers&#x2019; passion for nature, plants, gardens and agriculture is woven deeply into the fabric of America and aligned with their political thought, both reflecting and influencing it. In fact, I believe, it&#x2019;s impossible to understand the making of America without looking at the founding fathers as farmers and gardeners.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Founding Gardeners </i>examines the creation of the American nation and the lives of Washington, Adams, Jefferson and Madison through the lens of gardens, landscapes, nature and agriculture. Part of this is played out in Washington&#x2019;s Mount Vernon, Jefferson&#x2019;s Monticello and Madison&#x2019;s Montpelier&#x2014; all large plantations in Virginia&#x2014; as well as Adams&#x2019;s much smaller farm, Peacefield, in Quincy near Boston. But it was Benjamin Franklin who was the first of the revolutionaries to place plants at the heart of the country&#x2019;s struggle.<br> &nbsp;<br> In response to the tensions between Britain and America, Franklin turned to plants and agriculture. In his &#x201c;Positions to be examined concerning National Wealth,&#x201d; Franklin listed in 1769 the three ways by which a nation might acquire wealth, and gave his opinion on each: &#x201c;The first is by <i>War </i>. . . This is <i>Robbery. </i>The second by <i>Commerce </i>which is generally <i>Cheating. </i>The third by <i>Agriculture </i>the only <i>honest Way.</i>&#x201d; Eleven years before the thirteen colonies threw off the yoke of Britain&#x2019;s rule in 1776, the controversial Stamp Act had been given Royal Assent by King George III. This tax on paper affected almost every colonist, for it was applied to newspapers, legal documents, liquor licenses, books and every deck of cards. It was a desperate attempt to fill Britain&#x2019;s depleted coffers, run low by the Seven Years&#x2019; War, which had seen Britain fight against the French on North American soil. When the war had come to an end in 1763, the British economy lay in crisis, riddled with war debts and plagued by a series of bad harvests. Britain&#x2019;s solution was to make the colonists pay.<br> &nbsp;<br> As news of the ratification of the Stamp Act reached America, colonists rallied together to protest against Parliament&#x2019;s rule. The Virginia House of Burgesses&#x2014; the legislative assembly of colonial Virginia&#x2014;declared the tax illegal. Throughout the colonies, riots broke out. The protesters burned effigies and raided the houses of British officials&#x2014; on the way drinking their wine cellars dry&#x2014;insisting that the British had no right to levy such taxes on the colonies. In Boston, an effigy of Andrew Oliver (the man who collected the stamp duty) and of the devil holding a copy of the Stamp Act were hung from an ancient elm tree near the town common. In the evening, 3,000 people marched through the streets, smashing the windows of Oliver&#x2019;s house before beheading and burning his effigy on a bonfire made from his furniture.<br> &nbsp;<br> Franklin was in London at the time, having arrived in December 1764 on behalf of the Pennsylvania Assembly. His mission was to change the governance of Pennsylvania which was controlled by the so- called &#x201c;proprietors,&#x201d; the heirs of William Penn, who had founded the colony in the seventeenth century. It was his third visit to the British capital, a place he loved for the intellectual stimulation and sociability. But during this visit, his relationship with Britain underwent a seismic shift&#x2014; a shift that not only led to his assured signature on the Declaration of Independence, but that is also mirrored in his changing attitude toward seeds and crops. Indeed, his involvement with plants can be seen as a kind of barometer of his political convictions.<br> &nbsp;<br> For a long time Franklin had been interested in plants, both for their scientific and economic value. Part of a lively network of letter- writers who exchanged seeds with each other, he corresponded with farmers, gardeners and botanists in America and Europe, and experimented in his Philadelphia garden with different vegetables and crops. From London, he regularly sent seeds home to his wife, Deborah, helped by his British scientific and gardening friends. When one of them couldn&#x2019;t procure a new species of grain that Franklin wanted, another offered the entire produce of the previous year (clearly realizing how keen Franklin was). Franklin sent a new kind of oat and barley to Deborah to distribute among the plantsmen in Philadelphia, as well as sending vegetable seeds and Chinese rhubarb, which was valued for its medicinal properties. As the political troubles intensified, so did Franklin&#x2019;s agricultural interest.<br> &nbsp;<br> The outbreak of the anti&#x2013;Stamp Act protests in America had forced Franklin to become the unofficial ambassador for the colonies in Britain. He met the Lord Treasurer, Lord Grenville, in an attempt to persuade him to abandon the scheme but to no avail. Grenville, Franklin said, was &#x201c;besotted&#x201d; with it. Yet, though Franklin thought the Act to be unconstitutional and believed that the colonies had to be represented in Parliament, he did not, at this point, contemplate the possibility of independence. A &#x201c;faithful Adherence to the Government of this Nation,&#x201d; Franklin insisted as houses were burned in Philadelphia, &#x201c;will always be the wisest Course.&#x201d; But he misjudged how much his fellow colonists hated the impositions. In Pennsylvania, Franklin&#x2019;s steadfast defense of Britain was held against him and in late September 1765, furious rioters threatened to destroy his house in Philadelphia.<br> &nbsp;<br> Britain had always nurtured the colonies as her greatest export market&#x2014; paper, nails, glass, clothes and linen were all produced in Britain&#x2019;s burgeoning manufacturing sector and sold in American markets. In addition to staples, luxury products such as silverware, porcelain, carpets and silk became an important British export. The trade of hundreds of ships connected London, Bristol and Liverpool with Boston, Philadelphia and New York. Between 1730 and 1760, exports to the North American colonies quadrupled, filling the purses of British merchants and manufacturers. At the same time laws, regulations and duties imposed by the British and a lack of labor prevented the colonists from developing their own manufacturing sector. With plenty of fertile soil, the colonies<br> instead became the fields of the mother- country&#x2014; shipping grain, corn and tobacco to Britain. Consequently almost all colonists lived off the land. They fought against the wilderness, draining swampy soil and snatching plots from the rugged embrace of the forest. As they wrested their fields from the forest, trees fell in the thousands, clearing the way for cash crops such as tobacco, rice and indigo.<br> &nbsp;<br> Franklin believed that the colonists&#x2019; reliance on agriculture for their main income, combined with the seemingly endless resources of land, could be turned to their advantage. America could be self- sufficient. And as tension over the Stamp Act grew, Franklin argued that the colonies would be able to pressure the British by boycotting their goods. &#x201c;I do not know a single article,&#x201d; Franklin told MPs, that the colonies couldn&#x2019;t either &#x201c;do without or make themselves.&#x201d; It was his four- hour testimony in front of Parliament, many believed, that led to the repeal of the Stamp Act a few weeks later. But it soon became clear that the British had no<br> intention of offering the colonies representation in Parliament. Instead, more duties were imposed, including on tea, paint and glass&#x2014; all imported products that the colonists were only allowed to buy from Britain.<br> &nbsp;<br> For the next three years Franklin tried to persuade both the colonists and the British politicians to reach a compromise. In essays and letters in newspapers, he was constantly explaining, moderating, smoothing and arguing. But when the government refused to compromise, he finally had to admit that words were no longer enough. In January 1769, he rallied behind the colonists&#x2019; call for a sweeping boycott of British goods.<br> &nbsp;<br> The boycott made Franklin&#x2019;s seed collecting all the more urgent. Not only was he sending larger amounts of seeds and more varieties home, but these were now for America&#x2019;s profit alone, not for Britain&#x2019;s. Every time someone told Franklin about a new edible plant, he was thrilled by the possibility of its economic potential. &#x201c;I wish it may be found of Use with us,&#x201d; he told one correspondent when he forwarded seeds for a new crop, and when he heard of tofu, it so excited his curiosity, he said, that he procured a recipe from China, dispatching it together with chickpeas to a friend in Philadelphia. These dried seeds carried the possibility of a new world and political freedom. In the coming years he sent upland rice and tallow tree&#x2020; from China and seeds of &#x201c;useful Plants&#x201d; from India and Turkey, as well as introducing kohlrabi and Scottish kale, among many<br> others, to America.<br> &nbsp;<br> Franklin, who had been the &#x201c;chairman of British Colonies&#x201d; of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts Manufacturers and Commerce in London, now rarely went to the Society&#x2019;s meetings. The Society had tried to encourage colonists to grow commercial crops by paying premiums and awards, but by 1770 Franklin accused the Society of betraying the new nation, claiming that the &#x201c;true Spirit of all your Bounties&#x201d; were in the interest of Britain, not America. No longer was America to be a colonial grain store, or a market for Britain&#x2019;s goods. America, Franklin was convinced, could provide all the necessaries herself and they would just have to renounce the luxuries they couldn&#x2019;t produce. He echoed what John Adams had written in Boston&#x2019;s newspapers under the rustic pseudonym Humphrey Ploughjogger. In response to the Stamp Act, Adams had suggested that colonists should wear coats made of the hides of their own oxen rather than woollen ones from Britain. Adams promised that he would not buy &#x201c;one shilling worth of any thing that comes from old England.&#x201d; As such, self- sufficiency became a weapon in the fight for parliamentary representation and against British economic restrictions. Slowly colonists began to equate home production and agriculture with the upholding of domestic liberty.<br> &nbsp;<br> To Franklin&#x2019;s regret, the boycott did not pressure Parliament into relinquishing authority over the colonies. Nothing was achieved, and in May 1771 Franklin wrote that &#x201c;the seeds [are] sown of a total disunion of the two countries,&#x201d; while at the same time urging patience in order to postpone &#x201c;this catastrophe.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Franklin continued to plead for moderation, but it became clear that Britain would never accept an empire that would give the colonial assemblies the same rights as Parliament. As the clashes between Britain and her colonies escalated, Franklin became the voice of American rights in Britain and the scapegoat for the troubles. At the end of January 1774, six weeks after a group of colonists dumped more than three hundred chests of tea into Boston&#x2019;s harbor in protest against the tax on tea&#x2014;known as the Boston Tea Party&#x2014; Franklin was questioned and attacked in the Privy Council about the colonial affairs. As the abuse was hurled at him, the sixty- eight- year- old Franklin, dressed in a blue suit made of Manchester velvet, stood motionless and with his head held high before the British accusers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Three days later he wrote to his son William that &#x201c;my Office of Deputy- Postmaster is taken from me.&#x201d; The British government had stripped him of the post that he had held for almost twenty years, severing their connection with Franklin. In this briefest of letters, Franklin then advised William, who was the royal governor of New Jersey, to give up his position in order to become a farmer: &#x201c;I wish you were well settled in your Farm. &#x2019;Tis an honester and a more honourab...</p><h2>Dreaming the Soul Back Home: Shamanic Dreaming for Healing and Becoming Whole</h2><p>In this extraordinary book, shamanic dream teacher Robert Moss shows us how to become shamans of our own souls and healers of our own lives.<br><br>The greatest contribution of the ancient shamans to modern healing is the understanding that in the course of any life we are liable to suffer <i>soul loss</i> the loss of parts of our vital energy and identity and that to be whole and well, we must find the means of soul recovery.

These collectible editions are dressed in the iconic orange and white tri-band cover design, first created in 1935, while french flaps, high-quality paper, and striking cover illustrations provide the cutting-edge design treatment that is the signature of Penguin Classics Deluxe Editions today.<br><br><b><i>The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> Frequently imitated and widely influential, Howard Phillips Lovecraft reinvented the horror genre in the twentieth century, discarding ghosts and witches and instead envisioning mankind as a tiny outpost of dwindling sanity in a chaotic and malevolent universe. This definitive collection reveals the development of Lovecraft&#x2019;s mesmerizing narrative style and establishes him as a canonical&#x2014;and visionary&#x2014;American writer.</p><p><b>H. P. Lovecraft</b> (1890&#x2013;1937) was born in Providence, Rhode Island, where he lived most of his life. He wrote many essays and poems early in his career, but gradually focused on the writing of horror stories, after the advent in 1923 of the pulp magazine <i>Weird Tales</i>, to which he contributed most of his fiction. His relatively small corpus of fiction&#x2014;three short novels and about sixty short stories&#x2014;has nevertheless exercised a wide influence on subsequent work in the field, and he is regarded as the leading twentieth-century American author of supernatural fiction.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>S. T. Joshi</b> is a freelance writer and editor. He has prepared comprehensive editions of Lovecraft&#x2019;s collected fiction, essays, and poetry. He is also the author of <i>The Weird Tale</i> (1990), <i>The Modern Weird Tale</i> (2001), and <i>Unutterable Horror: A History of Supernatural Fiction</i> (2012). His award-winning biography <i>H. P. Lovecraft: A Life</i> (1996) was later expanded as <i>I Am Providence: The Life and Times of H. P. Lovecraft</i> (2010). He has also prepared Penguin Classics editions of the work of Arthur Machen, Lord Dunsany, Algernon Blackwood, M. R. James, and Clark Ashton Smith, as well as the anthology <i>American Supernatural Tales</i> (2007).Together, these books offer 30 "weird stories" by our nation's greatest horror writer. In addition to the title piece, Cthulhu includes "Rats in the Walls," "Herbert West Reanimator" (the basis of several fun B movies), and "The Haunter of the Dark." The Thing sports such standards as "The Dunwich Horror," "Pickman's Model," and "Beyond the Wall of Sleep." These corrected texts present the definitive versions of each tale. Each volume also contains notes and an introduction by scholar S.T. Joshi. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Kundalini Yoga: The Flow of Eternal Power: A Simple Guide to the Yoga of Awareness as taught by Yogi Bhajan, Ph.D.</h2><p>The practice of Kundalini yoga aims to unlock and awaken the radiant transformative energy that exists within every person. This book is the perfect introduction to the fundamentals of a Kundalini practice. Taught for thousands of years and brought to the West by Yogi Bhajan, Kundalini is a powerful mind-body style of yoga. When practiced regularly, Kundalini yoga can strengthen the nervous system, balance the glandular system, and harness the energy of the mind, emotions, and body, and is surprisingly simple to learn. While general yoga technique focuses on exercise postures and breathing, Kundalini takes the process a step further by integrating yoga into everyday life activities. <br><br> This definitive guide, fully illustrated with photographs, is an accessible introduction to the ancient practice of Kundalini yoga, with information on poses and positions, diet and lifestyle, breathing and stretching techniques, chanting and meditation exercises, and general guidelines that can help anyone&#x2014;beginner or advanced&#x2014;gain the greatest benefit from the practice of yoga.</p><p><i>Kundalini Yoga: A Simple Guide to the Yoga of Awareness</i> is an introduction to living your life with more awareness and spirituality, as well as a guide to the principles of this form of yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan, the author's teacher. Kundalini yoga includes habits and practices that "balance the glandular system, strengthen the nervous system, and enable us to harness the energy of the mind and the emotions," explains the author. She clearly explains many facets of this kundalini lifestyle: breathing (including breathing exercises), spirituality, food choices and preparation, chants and meditations, the chakras (energy centers in the body), self-healing, sleep, communication, and using yoga postures for health.<p> This is not an exercise book of yoga postures--although several are illustrated--but a guidebook toward a more spiritual path. "Spirituality cannot be taught. It has to be caught, you have to get it from someone who's got it." The book describes the path to a more spiritual life using kundalini yoga philosophy and practice. You don't have to move to a cave to adopt these practices--the author shows you how you can use them to balance even a busy, modern lifestyle. <i>-- Joan Price</i></p><b>Shakti Parwha Kaur Khalsa</b> was the first woman to study with Yogi Bhajan in the United States. Bhajan is the leader of the Sikh religion in the West and the founder of 3HO (Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization), which has 300 Kundalini Yoga centers around the world. Shakti has been teaching Kundalini Yoga for nearly 30 years, and was ordained as a minister of the Sikh Dharma in 1974.</p><h2>Our Native Bees: North America&#x2019;s Endangered Pollinators and the Fight to Save Them</h2><p><b>A New York Times 2018 Holiday Gift Selection</b><br><br> Honey bees get all the press, but the fascinating story of North America&#x2019;s native bees&#x2014;endangered species essential to our ecosystems and food supplies&#x2014;is just as crucial. Through interviews with farmers, gardeners, scientists, and bee experts, <i>Our Native Bees</i> explores the importance of native bees and focuses on why they play a key role in gardening and agriculture.

Prolific throughout his short life, he wrote notable works in the Realist tradition as well as early examples of American Naturalism and Impressionism. He is recognized by modern critics as one of the most innovative writers of his generation. The ninth surviving child of Protestant Methodist parents, Crane began writing at the age of four and had published several articles by the age of 16. Having little interest in university studies, he left college in 1891 to work as a reporter and writer. Crane's first novel was the 1893 Bowery tale Maggie: A Girl of the Streets, generally considered by critics to be the first work of American literary Naturalism. He won international acclaim in 1895 for his Civil War novel The Red Badge of Courage, which he wrote without having any battle experience. In 1896, Crane endured a highly publicized scandal after appearing as a witness in the trial of a suspected prostitute, an acquaintance named Dora Clark. Late that year he accepted an offer to travel to Cuba as a war correspondent. As he waited in Jacksonville, Florida, for passage, he met Cora Taylor, with whom he began a lasting relationship. En route to Cuba, Crane's vessel the SS Commodore, sank off the coast of Florida, leaving him and others adrift for 30 hours in a dinghy. Crane described the ordeal in "The Open Boat". During the final years of his life, he covered conflicts in Greece (accompanied by Cora, recognized as the first woman war correspondent) and later lived in England with her. He was befriended by writers such as Joseph Conrad and H. G. Wells. Plagued by financial difficulties and ill health, Crane died of tuberculosis in a Black Forest sanatorium in Germany at the age of 28. At the time of his death, Crane was considered an important figure in American literature. After he was nearly forgotten for two decades, critics revived interest in his life and work. Crane's writing is characterized by vivid intensity, distinctive dialects, and irony. Common themes involve fear, spiritual crises and social isolation.</p><h2>Living with the Himalayan Masters</h2><p><p>"I will tell you how I grew up and how I was trained, about the great sages with whom I lived and what they taught me, not through lectures and books but through experiences."- Swami Rama<br><br></p><br><p>Reading it, you will discover the human side to this yogic master.

He studied Western psychology, philosophy, and medicine in Europe and taught in Japan before coming to the United States in 1969. Here he founded the Himalayan Institute to create a bridge between the ancient teachings of the East and the modern scientific approaches of the West."Buy this book for yourself. Each page is filled with joy and cheer.

The glass is from the window that broke when I threw her head into the parking lot in a fit of rage.<br> <br>Rage that was very close to pleasure.<br> <br>&#x201c;Om, Shanti, Shanti, Shanti,&#x201d; I say to myself. The repetitive sounds constitute a famous mantra in India. It means &#x201c;Peace, peace, peace.&#x201d; It is similar to the Christian prayer &#x201c;Peace be with you.&#x201d; How ironic, I think, that the demon I have fought since I first became aware of the Telar and the IIC should have chosen to possess the body of a young woman with such a sacred name.<br> <br>Yet I feel no pity for the original Shanti. The demon could not have penetrated her heart without her permission. Only at the end did Shanti reveal how much she enjoyed causing others pain, just like her master.<br> <br>Well, she is dead now, thank God.<br> <br>But is the enemy? Have I even scratched his armor? Unfortunately, I haven&#x2019;t a clue. If only Umara were still alive. She was the world&#x2019;s expert when it came to demons. But Matt&#x2019;s mother sacrificed her life so I could destroy her people, the Telar, and the evil forces arrayed behind them. The cynical part of me wonders if her sacrifice was in vain. How does one destroy an evil that doesn&#x2019;t have a physical body?<br> <br>I hear approaching footsteps and know their source. There&#x2019;s only one other in the miserable motel who has my hearing. Matt must have heard the breaking glass and come to investigate. He knocks lightly and I call to him. He pokes his head inside my door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why is Shanti&#x2019;s head sitting on the hood of our SUV?&#x201d; he asks.<br> <br>Matt has on white shorts, no shirt or shoes. His well-muscled body is deeply tanned, his dark hair a mess from jumping up from sleep. But even though I just woke him up, his eyes are highly alert. How his eyes remind me of his father, Yaksha, the first and most powerful of all vampires. Matt is half vampire, half Telar, an immortal coin from his head to his toes.<br> <br>Looking at him, mostly naked in the room&#x2019;s dim light, I feel heat stir down below. Despite the circumstances, the lust does not surprise me. My attraction to him has been there from the start.<br> <br>&#x201c;She was the one. She was the spy,&#x201d; I reply.<br> <br>Matt steps into the room. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She told a few lies, and when I confronted her . . .&#x201d; I shrug. &#x201c;She confessed who she was before I killed her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What does this mean?&#x201d; Matt asks. His question appears simple but it is multilayered. Like me, he wants to know if we&#x2019;ve finally destroyed the demon. He&#x2019;s also asking if Shanti&#x2019;s death means the computer program that was planted on the Internet by the Cradle&#x2014;a group of psychic children&#x2014;is going to stop hunting us.<br> <br>We have been on the run since we blew up the IIC&#x2019;s headquarters and supposedly killed every member of the Cradle except for one, Ms. Cynthia Brutran&#x2019;s five-year-old daughter, Jolie. The two are asleep three doors away. I can only assume they failed to hear the breaking glass.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;But at least with Shanti out of the way what we talk about will no longer be heard by those who are trying to kill us.&#x201d;<br> <br>Matt&#x2019;s puzzled. &#x201c;You were close to her. You miss nothing. How was she able to fool you for so long?&#x201d;<br> <br>The question stings.<br> <br>&#x201c;She played me. It&#x2019;s no excuse, it&#x2019;s just . . .&#x201d; I pause, searching for the key to her deception. &#x201c;She made me care for her.&#x201d;<br> <br>Matt glances out the motel door, at the trickle of blood that runs over the SUV hood from the base of her severed skull. &#x201c;You weren&#x2019;t alone. You know Seymour loved her. This is going to kill him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s not tell him until morning.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want him to see her like this.&#x201d;<br> <br>Matt nods. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, I&#x2019;ll take the body and bury it in the desert. No one will find it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Matt reaches down and lifts Shanti&#x2019;s headless torso with one hand. The blood of Yaksha and my daughter, Kalika, flows through my veins, which makes me almost invincible. Yet I know Matt is stronger than me, although I&#x2019;m not sure of the extent of his power. He&#x2019;s reluctant to show it, even to me, but I don&#x2019;t take offense. In this way we are alike: He has a hard time trusting people. That&#x2019;s why his question continues to sting. I was the first one in the group to meet Shanti, and trust her.<br> <br>&#x201c;While I&#x2019;m taking care of the body, go through her things,&#x201d; Matt says. &#x201c;You never know what you might find.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good idea.&#x201d; I had already planned to do that. &#x201c;Are you sure you don&#x2019;t want help?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not necessary. I have a shovel in the trunk.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What made you bring a shovel?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Times like this.&#x201d;<br> <br>Matt stuffs the torso and head into several large-size garbage bags and walks off into the desert. He doesn&#x2019;t take the SUV; he doesn&#x2019;t need it. I feel a wave of relief as he disappears into the dark. Seymour&#x2019;s a night owl. There&#x2019;s always a chance he&#x2019;s up, watching TV or reading. He could even be writing a new book. He once told me he seldom went a whole day without writing a few pages.<br> <br>Shanti has a small suitcase in our motel room but a larger one in the back of the SUV. I find it interesting that she went out of her way to leave it in the vehicle. When I first open it, I&#x2019;m disappointed. It&#x2019;s stuffed with clothes, a few magazines, a pair of boots, running shoes, a watch, and a cell phone&#x2014;devoid of any stored numbers.<br> <br>Yet when I have finished emptying the suitcase on her bed, I notice a faint bulge on the interior of the lid, beneath the leather lining. Human eyes would never have noticed it. The area is sewn shut; indeed, it looks as if it has never been exposed since the day the suitcase was constructed. If I were to hide something, I think, and it were important to me, I would put it in exactly the same place.<br> <br>I tear off the inner lining of the suitcase.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s a manila envelope inside. I open it with a swipe of my fingernail. Inside are two items: a business card and a photograph. The card lists the name of a lawyer: Michael Larson of Pointe, Wolf, and Larson, 1250 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York. The card is made of high-quality paper, the printing is impeccable. It smells of money.<br> <br>Written on the back of the card, with a dull pencil, is another New York phone number.<br> <br>The photograph is of a middle-aged couple. The woman looks familiar, even though I&#x2019;m certain I&#x2019;ve never met her before. The couple sits smiling on a couch beside an open window that looks out on rolling grassland with a lake in the distance.<br> <br>They appear to be a typical couple. The man has his arm around his wife. I&#x2019;m certain they&#x2019;re married. There&#x2019;s an ease between them that only comes from having lived many years together. I see their love for each other in their eyes.<br> <br>Looking out the window, behind them, I&#x2019;m pretty sure I see a piece of land that belongs to North Carolina. The type of trees, the color of the lake, the way the green fields slope&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve visited the area before.<br> <br>On a small end table, to the right of the couch where they sit, is a black-and-white photograph. The picture is handsomely framed but it was taken with a primitive camera. The print is grainy, the focus questionable. I suspect the photograph was snapped in the forties or fifties.<br> <br>Once more, there&#x2019;s a couple, although these two are younger and they&#x2019;re standing on Ellis Island, near the foot of the Statue of Liberty. They&#x2019;re not alone&#x2014;a hundred people mill in the background. Most look weary and I can understand why. They have just crossed the Atlantic and arrived in the New World.<br> <br>But the couple at the forefront of the group don&#x2019;t look exhausted. On the contrary, they&#x2019;re bursting with excitement to be standing on the doorstep of New York City. Studying their faces I can see all the hopes and dreams they have for their future. But I also see their joy is tempered with sorrow. Even if I didn&#x2019;t know them, I&#x2019;d still see the pain in their eyes.<br> <br>But I do know them.<br> <br>Their names are Harrah and Ralph Levine.<br> <br>I met them during World War II, in Paris, and spent time with them in the most hellish place the modern age has ever known: Auschwitz, the concentration camp where over a million Jews were slaughtered. It was only because of Harrah and Ralph that I survived the camp.<br> <br>Now I know why the woman on the couch looks familiar.<br> <br>She&#x2019;s the granddaughter of Harrah and Ralph.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m still staring at the photograph when Matt returns. I hand it over, along with the card, and tell him who the people in the pictures are. Matt listens closely and studies them with a penetrating gaze. I don&#x2019;t bother to point out the numeric codes imprinted on Harrah&#x2019;s and Ralph&#x2019;s forearms. Matt misses nothing.<br> <br>&#x201c;How did you happen to become friends?&#x201d; he asks when he hands back the picture.<br> <br>&#x201c;We worked together in Paris, with the French Resistance.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you stay in contact after the war?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not exactly.&#x201d; I pause. &#x201c;We were all sent to Auschwitz.&#x201d;<br> <br>Matt is stunned. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not telling me you were a prisoner?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t a guest.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sita, how could the Nazis contain you? I don&#x2019;t understand.&#x201d;<br> <br>Those days are difficult for me to talk about.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a long story, an unbelievable story. Toward the end of the war, I decided to help the Allies defeat the Nazis. My reasons were complex&#x2014;I&#x2019;d just as soon not go into them now. But I never imagined for a moment that I&#x2019;d be taken prisoner by a bunch of fanatical Germans. The idea was preposterous. But the Nazis&#x2014;they had weapons I never imagined.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not following you,&#x201d; Matt says.<br> <br>I shake my head. &#x201c;It would take time to explain. And even if I do tell you everything, there&#x2019;s a good chance you&#x2019;ll think I made most of it up.&#x201d;<br> <br>Matt takes my hand. &#x201c;Sita, come on. I know you&#x2019;d never purposely lie to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>His fingers feel good wrapped around mine.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s the rub,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I might lie to you and not know it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Matt stares at me, waiting for me to explain. My body trembles. I feel a sharp pain inside my head and a dull ache in my heart. Loss, I feel loss.<br> <br>&#x201c;Those were dark days, Matt. The darkest of my life. The Nazis did terrible things to me, unspeakable things. It got to the point where I didn&#x2019;t know my own name. I don&#x2019;t know how I escaped. But I do know if it hadn&#x2019;t been for Harrah and Ralph, I wouldn&#x2019;t have survived.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How exactly did they help you?&#x201d; Matt asks.<br> <br>His question is reasonable. How were mere mortals able to help a five-thousand-year-old vampire? I wish I could answer without sounding like a complete nut.<br> <br>&#x201c;The Veil of Veronica. Have you heard of it?&#x201d; I ask.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard the stories, or I should say the myths. Isn&#x2019;t it supposed to be a cloth that Christ wiped his face on when he was carrying the cross to Calvary?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Harrah called it Golgotha but I suppose the name doesn&#x2019;t matter. It was where the crucifixion was supposed to have taken place. But Christ did not wipe his face on the cloth. It was the other way around. Veronica, the woman in the tales, dipped the cloth in water and wiped his brow. And an image of his face was immediately imprinted on the cloth.&#x201d;<br> <br>Matt considers. &#x201c;From what I&#x2019;ve read, it was fluids from portions of his face that stained the cloth. From his nose and his cheeks and his brow&#x2014;the raised parts. The liquid contained just a small amount of blood. It was mostly sweat and lymph fluids. Only a rough outline of a face was created. There wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be a clear picture.&#x201d; He adds, &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m no expert on the matter.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The veil isn&#x2019;t popular like the Shroud of Turin. Still, there are dozens of stories surrounding its history. These days, the Catholic Church avoids talking about it. But during the Middle Ages, for at least two hundred years, they had it on display in the Vatican. I saw it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did it have a face on it?&#x201d; Matt asks.<br> <br>&#x201c;It had a face most people associate with early Christian paintings. The image was remarkably clear. It had three <i>V</i>s on the bottom, all in a row. One from his beard, the others from his long, draped hair. I always found the symmetry curious. It didn&#x2019;t fit the style of art that was popular at that time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why did the Vatican hide it away?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Some say it got stolen. Others say it was shown to be a fake. A few say it burned in a fire.&#x201d;<br> <br>Matt frowns. &#x201c;But somehow, a thousand years after the Vatican lost it, your friends ended up with it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>&#x201c;How? And please don&#x2019;t tell me it&#x2019;s a long story.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It is, and I have a feeling I&#x2019;m going to have to tell it to the others. So I might as well tell it all at once.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re stalling. You know Seymour&#x2019;s not religious and Brutran is certainly not a regular churchgoer. They won&#x2019;t have any interest in this veil.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They will when I explain why I had to kill Shanti.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You think she was going after it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why else would she have these pictures?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because they&#x2019;re pictures of people from your past.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That means nothing. I&#x2019;m not in these pictures. What&#x2019;s important is that these people saved me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Using the veil?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. But it&#x2019;s not the way you think. You have to hear the whole story.&#x201d; I pause. &#x201c;Or as much of it as I can remember.&#x201d;<br> <br>Matt stares at me, his puzzlement growing. &#x201c;Sita, you&#x2019;re the same as me. You don&#x2019;t forget anything.&#x201d;<br> <br>I squeeze his hand and lean over and give him a kiss. He reaches out to hug me in return, but I avoid his embrace by sitting back. All of a sudden I feel dirty, unclean. I fear to infect him. I stare down at the photo again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;m afraid to remember,&#x201d; I say.</p><h2>Keeping You A Secret</h2><p><b>National Book Award finalist Julie Anne Peters delivers a moving, modern classic love story with a coming out theme -- now with a fresh, redesigned cover!</b><b><br></b> With a steady boyfriend, the position of Student Council President, and a chance to go to an Ivy League college, high school life is just fine for Holland Jaeger. <br>At least, it seems to be. <br>But when Cece Goddard comes to school, everything changes. Cece and Holland have undeniable feelings for each other, but how will others react to their developing relationship?<br>This moving love story between two girls is for fans of Nancy Garden's classic young adult coming out novel, <i>Annie on My Mind</i>. With her characteristic humor and breezy style, Peters has captured the compelling emotions of young love.</p><p>Julie Anne Peters is the critically acclaimed author of <em>Define "Normal,"</em> <em>Between Mom and Jo, Far from Xanadu</em>, and <em>Luna</em>, a National Book Award Finalist.Reviewed with Tea Benduhn's <i>Gravel Queen</i>.<p>Gr. 9-12. In these novels about first love, a high-school girl falls hard for another girl and faces the complicated pain of coming out to family, friends, and to one's self. In <i>Gravel Queen,</i> the author's debut novel, Aurin explores her first gay relationship, and finds that her best friend, a glamorous, possessive drama queen, is jealous. Benduhn focus on Aurin's self-discovery and friendships, closing the novel before Aurin tells her family what's going on. In<i> Keeping You a Secret,</i> model high-school senior Holland, who has a boyfriend, develops an overwhelming crush on Cece. The girls fall passionately in love and a tragic coming-out story ensues. Holland finds herself homeless and alone, except for Cece and a new gay support system.</p><p>Both novels, written in first-person, are filled with believable inner monologues and finely tuned contemporary dialogue. Benduhn includes some interesting cinematic references related to Aurin's filmmaking aspirations, but some of her descriptions are over-the-top. Peters' story and characters are more developed. Both books are romantic and layered, and many teens, particularly those with fluid sexual identities, will recognize the questions: Do you have to kiss someone to be gay? What do fantasies mean? <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

See its texture, shape, and color&#x2014;got it?&#x201d;<br>I smile, holding the image in my head.<br>&#x201c;Good. Now reach out and touch it. Feel its contours with the tips of your fingers, cradle its weight in the palms of your hands, then combine all of your senses&#x2014;sight, touch, smell, taste&#x2014;can you taste it?&#x201d;<br>I bite my lip and suppress a giggle.<br>&#x201c;Perfect. Now combine that with feeling. Believe it exists right before you. Feel it, see it, touch it, taste it, accept it, manifest it!&#x201d; he says.<br>So I do. I do all of those things. And when he groans, I open my eyes to see for myself.<br>&#x201c;Ever.&#x201d; He shakes his head. &#x201c;You were supposed to think of an orange. This isn&#x2019;t even close.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nope, nothing fruity about him.&#x201d; I laugh, smiling at each of my Damens&#x2014;the replica I manifested before me, and the flesh and blood version beside me. Both of them equally tall, dark, and so devastatingly handsome they hardly seem real.<br>&#x201c;What am I going to do with you?&#x201d; the real Damen asks, attempting a disapproving gaze but failing miserably. His eyes always betray him, showing nothing but love.<br>&#x201c;Hmmm...&#x201d; I glance between my two boyfriends&#x2014;one real, one conjured. &#x201c;I guess you could just go ahead and kiss me. Or, if you&#x2019;re too busy, I&#x2019;ll ask him to stand in, I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;d mind.&#x201d; I motion toward manifest Damen, laughing when he smiles and winks at me even though his edges are fading and soon he&#x2019;ll be gone.<br>But the real Damen doesn&#x2019;t laugh. He just shakes his head and says, &#x201c;Ever, please. You need to be serious. There&#x2019;s so much to teach you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the rush?&#x201d; I fluff my pillow and pat the space right beside me, hoping he&#x2019;ll move away from my desk and come join me. &#x201c;I thought we had nothing but time?&#x201d; I smile. And when he looks at me, my whole body grows warm and my breath halts in my throat, and I can&#x2019;t help but wonder if I&#x2019;ll ever get used to his amazing beauty&#x2014;his smooth olive skin, brown shiny hair, perfect face, and lean sculpted body&#x2014;the perfect dark yin to my pale blond yang. &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;ll find me a very eager student,&#x201d; I say, my eyes meeting his&#x2014;two dark wells of unfathomable depths.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re insatiable,&#x201d; he whispers, shaking his head and moving beside me, as drawn to me as I am to him.<br>&#x201c;Just trying to make up for lost time,&#x201d; I murmur, always so eager for these moments, the times when it&#x2019;s just us, and I don&#x2019;t have to share him with anyone else. Even knowing we have all of eternity laid out before us doesn&#x2019;t make me any less greedy.<br>He leans in to kiss me, forgoing our lesson. All thoughts of manifesting, remote viewing, telepathy&#x2014;all of that psychic business replaced by something far more immediate, as he pushes me back against a pile of pillows and covers my body with his, the two of us merging like crumbled vines seeking the sun.<br>His fingers snake under my top, sliding along my stomach to the edge of my bra as I close my eyes and whisper, &#x201c;I love you.&#x201d; Words I once kept to myself. But after saying it the first time, I&#x2019;ve barely said anything else.<br>Hearing his soft muffled groan as he releases the clasp on my bra, so effortlessly, so perfectly, nothing awkward or fumbling about it.<br>Every move he makes is so graceful, so perfect, so&#x2014;<br>Maybe too perfect.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; he asks, as I push him away. His breath coming in short shallow gasps as his eyes seek mine, their surrounding skin tense and constricted in the way I&#x2019;ve grown used to.<br>&#x201c;Nothing&#x2019;s wrong.&#x201d; I turn my back and adjust my top, glad I completed the lesson on shielding my thoughts since it&#x2019;s the only thing that allows me to lie.<br>He sighs and moves away, denying me the tingle of his touch and the heat of his gaze as he paces before me. And when he finally stops and faces me, I press my lips together, knowing what&#x2019;s next. We&#x2019;ve been here before.<br>&#x201c;Ever, I&#x2019;m not trying to rush you or anything. Really, I&#x2019;m not,&#x201d; he says, his face creased with concern. &#x201c;But at some point you&#x2019;re going to have to get over this and accept who I am. I can manifest anything you desire, send telepathic thoughts and images whenever we&#x2019;re apart, whisk you away to Summerland at a moment&#x2019;s notice. But the one thing I can&#x2019;t ever do is change the past. It just is.&#x201d;<br>I stare at the floor, feeling small, needy, and completely ashamed. Hating that I&#x2019;m so incapable of hiding my jealousies and insecurities, hating that they&#x2019;re so transparent and clearly displayed. Because no matter what sort of psychic shield I create, it&#x2019;s no use. He&#x2019;s had six hundred years to study human behavior (to study my behavior), versus my sixteen.<br>&#x201c;Just&#x2014;just give me a little more time to get used to all this,&#x201d; I say, picking at a frayed seam on my pillowcase. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only been a few weeks.&#x201d; I shrug, remembering how I killed his ex-wife, told him I loved him, and sealed my immortal fate, less than three weeks ago.<br>He looks at me, his lips pressed together, his eyes tinged with doubt. And even though we&#x2019;re merely a few feet apart, the space that divides us is so heavy and fraught&#x2014;it feels like an ocean.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m referring to this lifetime,&#x201d; I say, my voice quickening, rising, hoping to fill up the void and lighten the mood. &#x201c;And since I can&#x2019;t recall any of the others, it&#x2019;s all I have. I just need a little more time, okay?&#x201d; I smile nervously, my lips feeling clumsy and loose as I hold them in place, exhaling in relief when he sits down beside me, lifts his fingers to my forehead, and seeks the space where my scar used to be.<br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s one thing we&#x2019;ll never run out of.&#x201d; He sighs, trailing his fingers along the curve of my jaw as he leans in to kiss me, his lips making a series of stops from my forehead, to my nose, to my mouth.<br>And just when I think he&#x2019;s about to kiss me again, he squeezes my hand and moves away.

In 1500, global income differences were small, but disparities have grown dramatically since Columbus reached America. In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, Robert C. Allen shows how the interplay of geography, globalization, technological change, and economic policy has determined the wealth and poverty of nations. Allen shows how the industrial revolution was Britain's path-breaking response to the challenge of globalization. Western Europe and North America joined Britain to form a club of rich nations, pursuing four polices--creating a national market by abolishing internal tariffs and investing in transportation, erecting an external tariff to protect their fledgling industries from British competition, creating banks to stabilize the currency and mobilize domestic savings for investment, and promoting mass education to prepare people for industrial work. Together these countries pioneered new technologies that have made them ever richer. A few countries--Japan, Soviet Russia, South Korea, Taiwan, and perhaps China--have caught up with the West through creative responses to the technological challenge and with Big Push industrialization that has achieved rapid growth through coordinated investment.<br></p><p><br><strong>Robert C.

Let us count the ways: They're on street signs and bus stops, featured on phones, thermometers, chalkboards, and scales. They show the time and the date, and help us to measure distance, sizing, and so much more. This spirited picture book by beloved author-illustrator Taro Gomi will charm and inform the youngest of readers, offering them a unique&#x2014;and useful&#x2014;look at a key concept we count on.</p><p>Taro Gomi is an internationally renowned author and illustrator who has created more than 350 books for readers of all ages, including the bestselling <em>Bus Stops</em>, <em>My Friends</em>, <em>Spring Is Here</em>, <em>Over the Ocean</em>, and <em>Presents Through the Window</em>. He lives in Tokyo, Japan.PreS-K&#x2014;What is the time? Is your temperature low or high? How much do you weigh? What is your building number? Gomi points out that numbers are everywhere and takes young readers on a counting adventure as he demonstrates the applications of numbers in their daily life. The colorful illustrations call young readers to attention. When the text references numbers, they are shown in context on a clock, on a calendar, on TV channels, on street signs, on phones, on thermometers, and even as page numbers of the book they are reading. The resounding selection of people, objects, and concepts turns a counting book into a delightful cultural experience where cars drive on the left side of the road and a group of boys and girls together do the math on the board. This is not a book to teach children how to count. However, through a series of playful illustrations and different scenarios, kids will enjoy learning about the many common applications of numbers. VERDICT An excellent addition to collections of concept books, suitable for one-on-one and small group sharing.&#x2014;Taraneh Matloob Haghanikar, University of Northern Iowa, Iowa City</p><h2>How to Write a BA Thesis, Second Edition: A Practical Guide from Your First Ideas to Your Finished Paper (Chicago Guides to Writing, Editing, and Publishing)</h2><p><i>How to Write a BA Thesis </i>is the only book that directly addresses the needs of undergraduate students writing a major paper.

However, we also like them because they are what we would but cannot be&#x2014;coordinated animals, whose simplicity and unity of action are spontaneous, whereas in the philosopher they come only after struggle and suppression. We like them because of what in us is called selfishness&#x2014;the naturalness and undisguised directness of their instincts. We like their unhypocritical candor; they do not smile to us when they long for our annihilation. Kinder und Narren sprechen die Wahrheit&#x2014;&#x201c;Children and fools speak the truth&#x201d;; and somehow they find happiness in their sincerity.<br> <br>See him, the newborn, dirty but marvelous, ridiculous in actuality, infinite in possibility, capable of that ultimate miracle&#x2014;growth. Can you conceive it&#x2014;that this queer bundle of sound and pain will come to know love, anxiety, prayer, suffering, creation, metaphysics, death? He cries; he has been so long asleep in the quiet warm womb of his mother; now suddenly he is compelled to breathe, and it hurts; compelled to see light, and it pierces him; compelled to hear noise, and it terrifies him. Cold strikes his skin, and he seems to be all pain. But it is not so; nature protects him against this initial onslaught of the world by dressing him in a general insensitivity. He sees the light only dimly; he hears the sounds as muffled and afar. For the most part he sleeps. His mother calls him a &#x201c;little monkey,&#x201d; and she is right; until he walks he will be like an ape, and even less of a biped, the womb-life having given his funny little legs the incalculable flexibility of a frog&#x2019;s. Not till he talks will he leave the ape behind, and begin to climb precariously to the stature of a human being.<br> <br>Watch him, and see how, bit by bit, he learns the nature of things by random movements of exploration. The world is a puzzle to him; and these haphazard responses of grasping, biting, and throwing are the pseudopodia, which he puts out to a perilous experience. Curiosity consumes and develops him; he would touch and taste everything from his rattle to the moon. For the rest he learns by imitation, though his parents think he learns by sermons. They teach him gentleness, and beat him; they teach him mildness of speech, and shout at him; they teach him a Stoic apathy to finance, and quarrel before him about the division of their income; they teach him honesty, and answer his most profound questions with lies. Our children bring us up by showing us, through imitation, what we really are.<br> <br>The child might be the beginning and the end of philosophy. In its insistent curiosity and growth lies the secret of all metaphysics; looking upon it in its cradle, or as it creeps across the floor, we see life not as an abstraction, but as a flowing reality that breaks through all our mechanical categories, all our physical formulas. Here in this expansive urgency, this patient effort and construction, this resolute rise from hands to feet, from helplessness to power, from infancy to maturity, from wonder to wisdom&#x2014;here is the &#x201c;Unknowable&#x201d; of Spencer, the Noumenon of Kant, the Ens Realissimum of the Scholastics, the &#x201c;Prime Mover&#x201d; of Aristotle, the To ontos on, or &#x201c;That Which Really Is,&#x201d; of Plato; here we are nearer to the basis of things than in the length and breadth and thickness and weight and solidity of matter, or in the cogs and pulleys and wheels and levers of a machine. Life is that which is discontent, which struggles and seeks, which suffers and creates. No mechanistic or materialistic philosophy can do it justice, or understand the silent growth and majesty of a tree, or compass the longing and laughter of children.<br> <br>Childhood may be defined as the age of play; therefore some children are never young, and some adults are never old.</p><h2>The Silent Wife: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>Soon to be a major motion picture starring Nicole Kidman, fans of&nbsp;<i>The Girl on the Train&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Gone Girl&nbsp;</i>will love&nbsp;<i>The Silent Wife</i></b><br><br>"<b>I gobbled it down in one sitting."&nbsp;&#x2013; Anne Lamott,&nbsp;<i>People</i></b><br><br></p><p>Jodi and Todd are at a bad place in their marriage. Much is at stake, including the affluent life they lead in their beautiful waterfront condo in Chicago, as she, the killer, and he, the victim, rush haplessly toward the main event. He is a committed cheater. She lives and breathes denial. He exists in dual worlds. She likes to settle scores. He decides to play for keeps. She has nothing left to lose. Told in alternating voices, <i>The Silent Wife </i>is about a marriage in the throes of dissolution, a couple headed for catastrophe, concessions that can&#x2019;t be made, and promises that won&#x2019;t be kept. Expertly plotted and reminiscent of <i>Gone Girl</i> and <i>These Things Hidden</i>, <i>The Silent Wife</i> ensnares the reader from page one and does not let go.</p><br><br><b><i><br></i></b></p><p><b>A. S. A. Harrison</b> is the author of four books of nonfiction. <i>The Silent Wife</i> is her debut novel and she was at work on a new psychological thriller when she died in 2013. She lived with her husband, visual artist John Massey, in Toronto, Canada.<p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p>HER</p><p>It&#x2019;s early September. Jodi Brett is in her kitchen, making dinner. Thanks to the open plan of the condo, she has an unobstructed view through the living room to its east-facing windows and beyond to a vista of lake and sky, cast by the evening light in a uniform blue. A thinly drawn line of a darker hue, the horizon, appears very near at hand, almost touchable. She likes this delineating arc, the feeling it gives her of being encircled. The sense of containment is what she loves most about living here, in her aerie on the twenty-seventh ?oor.</p><p>At forty-?ve, Jodi still sees herself as a young woman. She does not have her eye on the future but lives very much in the moment, keeping her focus on the everyday. She assumes, without having thought about it, that things will go on inde?nitely in their imperfect yet entirely acceptable way. In other words, she is deeply unaware that her life is now peaking, that her youthful resilience&#x2014;which her twenty-year marriage to Todd Gilbert has been slowly eroding&#x2014;is approaching a ?nal stage of disintegration, that her notions about who she is and how she ought to conduct herself are far less stable than she supposes, given that a few short months are all it will take to make a killer out of her.</p><p>If you told her this she would not believe you. Murder is barely a word in her vocabulary, a concept without meaning, the subject of stories in the news having to do with people she doesn&#x2019;t know and will never meet. Domestic violence she ?nds especially implausible, that everyday friction in a family setting could escalate to such a degree. There are reasons for this incomprehension, even aside from her own habit of self-control: She is no idealist, believes in taking the bad with the good, does not pick ?ghts, and is not easily baited.</p><p>The dog, a golden retriever with a silky blond coat, sits at her feet as she works at the cutting board. Every now and then she throws him a slice of raw carrot, which he catches in his mouth and joyfully grinds up with his molars. This vegetable toss is a long-standing predinner ritual, one that she and the dog have enjoyed from the time she brought him home as a roly-poly pup to take Todd&#x2019;s mind o? his yearning for progeny, which sprang up, seemingly overnight, around the time he turned forty. She named the dog Freud in anticipation of the fun she could poke at his namesake, the misogynist whom she was forced to take seriously at university. Freud passing gas, Freud</p><p>eating garbage, Freud chasing his tail. The dog is endlessly good-natured and doesn&#x2019;t mind in the least being an object of fun.</p><p>Trimming vegetables and chopping herbs, she throws herself bodily into the work. She likes the intensity of cooking&#x2014;the readiness of the gas ?ame, the timer marking o? the minutes, the immediacy of the result. She&#x2019;s aware of the silence beyond the kitchen, everything rushing to the point in time when she&#x2019;ll hear his key in the lock, an event that she anticipates with pleasure. She can still feel that making dinner for Todd is an occasion, can still marvel at the stroke of fate that brought him into her life, a matter of rank chance that did not seem to favor a further acquaintance, much less a future of appetizing meals, lovingly prepared.</p><p>It came to pass on a rainy morning in spring. Busy with her graduate studies in psychology, waiting tables at night, overworked, exhausted, she was moving house, driving north on State Street in a rental van loaded with her household goods. As she prepared to change lanes from right to left she might have looked over her shoulder or maybe not. She found the van awkward, didn&#x2019;t have a feel for it, and on top of this her windows were fogged and she&#x2019;d missed her turn at the last set of lights. Given these conditions she might have been distracted&#x2014;a question that later came to be much discussed between them. When he clipped her driver&#x2019;s-side door and spun her into oncoming tra?c, there was a general honking of horns and squealing of brakes, and before she could pull herself together&#x2014;before she fully realized that her van had come to a standstill and she was perfectly alright&#x2014;he was screaming at her through her closed window.</p><p>&#x201c;You crazy bitch. What in God&#x2019;s name do you think you&#x2019;re doing? Are you some kind of maniac? Where did you learn to drive? People like you should stay o? the road. Are you going to get out of your car or are you just going to sit there like an imbecile?&#x201d;</p><p>His tirade that day in the rain did not give a favorable impression, but a man who&#x2019;s been in a car crash is going to be irate even if it&#x2019;s his own fault, which in this instance it was not, so when he called a few days later to ask her to dinner, she graciously accepted.</p><p>He took her to Greektown, where they ate lamb souvlaki washed down with cold retsina. The restaurant was crowded, the tables close together, the lights bright. They found themselves shouting over the din and laughing at their failure to be heard. What conversation they could manage was pared down to succinct phrases like, &#x201c;The food is good . . . I like it here . . . my windows were fogged . . . if it hadn&#x2019;t happened I would never have met you.&#x201d;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t go out on many bona ?de dates. The men she knew from university took her for pizza and beer and counted out their money. They&#x2019;d meet her at the restaurant scru?y and unshaven, still in the clothes they&#x2019;d worn to class. Whereas Todd had put on a clean shirt, and he&#x2019;d picked her up, and they&#x2019;d driven to the restaurant together&#x2014;and now he was looking after her, re?lling her glass and checking on her comfort level. Sitting across from him, she was pleased with what she saw&#x2014;the way he casually took up space and his air of being in charge. She liked the homey habit he had of wiping his knife on his bread and that he put down his credit card without looking at the bill.</p></p><h2>Last Night at the Lobster</h2><p><b>A frank and funny yet emotionally resonant tale set within a vivid work day world, from the author of <i>Emily, Alone </i>and <i>Henry, Himself</i>--named a Best Book of the Year by <i>The Washington Post</i>, the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, and <i>Entertainment Weekly<br></i></b><br><b>A Finalist for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize</b><br><br> Perched in the far corner of a run-down New England mall, the Red Lobster hasn't been making its numbers and headquarters has pulled the plug.

But when we encounter voices we find loathsome, we usually can pinpoint why without difficulty: too nasal, too whiny, too steeped in anger or sodden with melancholy.<br><br>The bard&#x2019;s voice was the ineffable sort.<br><br>He planted himself behind the battlement facing the peninsula, where the vast sea of refugees swirled around their tents, and raised his hands from his sides as if to embrace all the people who had washed up there because of the war. Then he turned slowly as he spoke, including the city in his address as well: &#x201c;Good people of Pelemyn, I am Fintan, Bard of the Poet Goddess Kaelin.&#x201d; At once, eyes swiveled to lock upon his form or heads tilted in the far corners of the city to hear his disembodied voice better; conversations subsided, and other magics seemed to begin their work. His beaming face elicited a kindred response and lifted moods; the cup of watery beer from a nameless keg that I had in my hand suddenly tasted like the crisp, legendary brews of Forn; pleasant aromas of fresh food were accentuated and wafted about on the wind, and the less pleasant whiffs of unwashed bodies and rotting garbage faded away.<br><br>&#x201c;It is my life&#x2019;s work to tell stories,&#x201d; the bard continued, his smile gone now and replaced with an earnest tone. &#x201c;And no one else can tell you what I have seen.

They were all dirty and ragged now, and purple hollows lay under their eyes, testament to lost sleep, lost loved ones, just . . . loss.<br><br>&#x201c;But I am also struck by the sudden heroism of people all across the continent. For I have come from the other side of it, the western front, where I participated in the great battle below the Godsteeth.&#x201d; A tide of exclamation greeted that announcement, and I marveled that it came from far out on the peninsula and from the streets of the city as well. He was not shouting&#x2014;�his volume was what one might use for a toast at a fair-�sized dinner party&#x2014;�yet no one had difficulty hearing him.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I witnessed that and much more. I can tell you exactly what happened in the Granite Tunnel&#x2014;�&#x201d; Here the people sent up another cheer. &#x201c;&#x2014;�and I can reveal that a peace-�loving citizen of Kauria, acting at the behest of Mistral Kira, long may she reign, has had a secret role to play in this war and indeed may have finally found a way to bring it to an end. It is why I am here now.&#x201d; That earned him the loudest roar yet, and he nodded at Survivor Field, assuring them that what he said was true. &#x201c;Friends, I have permission from the pelenaut to tell you that there is a fleet on its way here from Kauria this instant. And it is coming to pick up the two allied armies that are marching this way across the mountains&#x2014;�one from Rael and one from Forn&#x2014;�and together they will sail across the ocean with your own forces to answer the enemy in kind for what they have done to us!&#x201d;<br><br>The emotion that news tore from the throats of the assembled would have drowned out even the power of his kenning. It was angry at first, not directed at him but at distant shores, a tide of people who had lost almost everything and hungered for a balancing of the scales, and then it lightened, morphing into jubilation as people felt hope for the first time in months. They hugged one another, danced in the mud, tears streaming down their faces as they punched the air with their fists, for it was good news at last instead of another dose of despair, and I was not immune to those feelings. I lost track of the bard for a few minutes as I surveyed Survivor Field and then crossed to the other side of the wall and saw the same celebration happening in the streets of the city.<br><br>People skipped out of the buildings to embrace and smile and savor the sight of teeth that weren&#x2019;t bared in a snarl or a cry. I could not see my own house from the wall, but I imagined that even Elynea might be grinning right then, and I was sorry to miss it; she had never looked anything but haunted since she and her children had come to live with me. And when the bard spoke again, his voice cutting through the noise as people were trying to find their second wind, he was no longer standing on the wall, half hidden by the crenellations, but was up on an improvised stage a few mariners had cobbled together out of crates. &#x201c;But our relief and the enemy&#x2019;s defeat will not arrive tomorrow or even the next day. It will take time for it to get here and even more time to prepare the voyage. I am told it could be up to sixty days. In the meantime, the pelenaut thinks it wise that you all hear what has happened elsewhere, for it is doubtful you have heard more than rumors. He has asked me to share what I know with you all, and he is listening as well. I am therefore engaged in your service, and I will tell you the tale in the old way, performing each afternoon until the sun sets. I hope you will take heart, as I have, from the small victories against overwhelming odds, all of which allow us to be here today, to be here tomorrow, and, gods willing, generations hence, to tell these stories again.&#x201d;<br><br>The bard had to pause here for another swell of applause, and while he did, a young woman stepped onto the stage of crates with a giant flagon and presented it to him, speaking a few words in his ear that did not carry like the bard&#x2019;s voice. Fintan dipped his head in thanks to her, and then his voice floated again on the wind.<br><br>&#x201c;It seems that Brynl�n&#x2019;s reputation for generosity is well deserved! Master Y�ndyr, owner and brewmaster of the the Siren&#x2019;s Call in the city, gives me a flagon of Mistmaiden Ale&#x2014;�purely medicinal, I&#x2019;m sure&#x2014;�and lodging at his inn for the length of my engagement! Thank you, sir!&#x201d; Appreciative noises were directed at Y�ndyr for having such excellent sense, and I imagined that other inn owners were cussing themselves for not thinking of it first; the Siren&#x2019;s Call had just received the best advertising possible. Smiling as he did so, Fintan took the opportunity to tip the flagon and then wipe the foam from his upper lip. He then returned the flagon to the woman and wrapped himself in an air of dramatic doom, saying, &#x201c;Listen.&#x201d; Everyone I could see on either side of the wall stood rapt, many of us grinning at him in anticipation despite the fact that he had advertised details of a war we already knew too well. It didn&#x2019;t matter because we were all children again, waiting to be told a story, and we had hope now that it would end well.<br><br>&#x201c;Like all tales worth the telling, I shall begin at the beginning&#x2014;�but your beginning, not Kauria&#x2019;s or Forn&#x2019;s or anyone else&#x2019;s. We&#x2019;ll get to them later. We&#x2019;re going to start with the reason this city still stands&#x2014;�your own tidal mariner! So take some time, friends, wherever you are. Fill your cups, visit the privy, do what you must so that you can be free in a few minutes to bend an ear for my tale&#x2014;�come closer to the wall so you can see me if you are out of my sight! If you&#x2019;re thirsty, I can confirm that Y�ndyr&#x2019;s Mistmaiden Ale can slake a thirst like nothing else! I&#x2019;ll begin soon!&#x201d;<br><br>An afternoon of entertainment with one of our own featured as the heroine? Maybe with snacks and beer? We couldn&#x2019;t wait! Everyone began to move and talk at once, and there was a general rush for food and drink on either side of the wall, all other occupations forgotten. Master Y�ndyr, no doubt, was delighted.<br>&#x201c;Let us begin,&#x201d; Fintan said, his voice spreading effortlessly across the city and the peninsula a few minutes later. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to invite someone very special up here: Pelemyn&#x2019;s tidal mariner, Tallynd du B�ll. Tallynd, please join me.&#x201d;<br><br>A woman in a military uniform stepped onto the makeshift stage with Fintan to thunderous applause, favoring her left leg as she did so. She had insignia that I had never seen before, which I at first assumed was due to her blessing but which I learned later meant a new military rank. She had kind eyes, a weary smile, and close cropped hair going gray at the temples. She waved to the refugees on Survivor Field, and Fintan indicated that she should speak.<br><br>&#x201c;Say something. I&#x2019;ll make sure they hear you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh. Well, hello?&#x201d; Her voice carried for a league thanks to Fintan&#x2019;s kenning, and she received cheers in response. &#x201c;Wow. Okay. I want everyone to know that I have shared both my duty log and my personal thoughts with Fintan prior to this. Except I&#x2019;m sure he will organize it all much better than I ever could or did. Anyway: it&#x2019;s the truth of things, and I&#x2019;m glad that he will tell it all. It&#x2019;s not the sort of tale you may be thinking it is right now. And you should know it.&#x201d;<br><br>Fintan pulled out what looked like a small black egg from a pouch tied to his belt and held it up between his thumb and forefinger. He cast the egg at his feet, and black smoke billowed up in a column, shrouding his body completely until his form resolved into an exact copy of Tallynd du B�ll, uniform and all, growing a couple of inches in the process. Fintan was a fairly short, dark man&#x2014;�his skin not quite as dark as that of we Brynts&#x2014;�distinguished by an overlarge nose perched above a generous mouth in a narrow face. It was therefore quite a shock to everyone to see him transform into the distinguished savior of our city, stand right next to her, and say with her voice, &#x201c;Thank you, Tidal Mariner.&#x201d;<br><br>She gasped&#x2014;�everyone did, honestly&#x2014;�and she said, &#x201c;Oh, drown me, do I really look and sound like that?&#x201d; Laughter from the crowd. &#x201c;Never mind. Thank you, Fintan.&#x201d; She waved again and stepped off the stage, and the bard told us, as Tallynd, what really happened the night the giants came.<br>Before my husband died five years ago, in a moment mellowed by drink and the puff of a Fornish gourd bowl, he asked me what price I thought we would all pay for the peace we&#x2019;d enjoyed for so many years.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d; I asked him. We were sitting in our small fountain court behind our house, and I was idly using my kenning to curl the water in twirling spirals before they dropped into the reservoir below. He hunched forward, leaning elbows on knees, and withdrew the pipe from his mouth, squinting through the smoke and waggling the stem at me.<br><br>&#x201c;You have been in the military for what, four years now? And you have yet to fight a single battle. There&#x2019;s always a price to be paid for that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why must we pay it?&#x201d; I countered. &#x201c;Perhaps the price was already paid by those who came before us.&#x201d;<br><br>He bobbed his head to either side, admitting the possibility. &#x201c;Perhaps you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We read all those stale histories in school, you know, and I don&#x2019;t doubt that they scrubbed away a whole lot of blood and pain. Countless tragedies happening to families like ours, all reduced to a sentence or three, while pages were devoted to what this ruler ate or what that rich person wore.&#x201d; He snorted smoke through his nostrils. &#x201c;But I still think we have it coming to us, love. And I worry about it. Because when it comes, you&#x2019;ll be the first to greet it.&#x201d;<br><br>I laughed at him then. I did! I remember it so clearly now, though it didn&#x2019;t seem important then. Because in that time, in that place, when he was so handsome and I wanted to have another child with him, when the sun was setting and bronzed his beautiful dark face, I could not conceive of war. I could not conceive of it, in fact, right up until it came to me first, just as he said it would. But by the time it came, he was long returned to the ocean, and our two boys were eight and nine and barely remembered him. I thought that was the worst tragedy in the world until the Bone Giants sailed over my head.<br><br>Normally I&#x2019;m on duty during daylight hours, but by request of the fisher clave I was mapping the crab beds and taking note of the feeding habits of other nocturnal species in the waters north of the peninsula, keeping an eye out as always for any ship-�sinking predators. I was in deep water far offshore when I heard, or rather felt, the slicing of keels through water on the surface at moonrise. It was an anomaly since no boats should have been in the area during the course of my mapping. Even allowing for fishermen who ignored the boundary buoys, it was far too much turbulence for one or two rogue net trawlers. I rose to investigate.<br><br>During the ascent, I realized the number of keels was not merely an unusual grouping of boats but a massive fleet of transport ships of strange origin. Upon breaking the surface, I saw that they definitely were not a Brynt fleet. Nor were they of Raelech or Kaurian construction or any recognizable profile. They were broad-�bottomed sailing ships outfitted with oars, though at the moment they were under full wind from the east. The decks mounted no harpoons or other visible weapons. They were, however, packed with people. Tall, thin people with bone armor on their torsos and arms. They looked like ribs. I also saw handheld weapons, swords of some kind. They all had them, and they were all looking ahead at the firebowls atop the walls of Pelemyn and the smaller lamps along the docks.</p><h2>Interpreting Scripture with the Great Tradition: Recovering the Genius of Premodern Exegesis</h2><p>The rise of modernity, especially the European Enlightenment and its aftermath, has negatively impacted the way we understand the nature and interpretation of Christian Scripture. In this introduction to biblical interpretation, Craig Carter evaluates the problems of post-Enlightenment hermeneutics and offers an alternative approach: exegesis in harmony with the Great Tradition. Carter argues for the validity of patristic christological exegesis, showing that we must recover the Nicene theological tradition as the context for contemporary exegesis, and seeks to root both the nature and interpretation of Scripture firmly in trinitarian orthodoxy.</p><p>"The rediscovery and celebration of patristic exegesis continues apace and across a wide ecumenical spectrum. Craig Carter offers here a robust, readable, and bracing defense of a fundamental truth: patristic exegesis offers not only a 'method' for reading but a <i>theology</i> of Scripture. Following this insight Carter develops a theology of Scripture rooted deeply in the Nicene doctrine of God and poses a stark challenge to all who would separate the reading of the text from our theological confession."<br>--<b>Lewis Ayres</b>, Durham University<br><br>"A timely intervention into the contemporary conversation. I nearly called it an interruption because the book is so feisty, blunt, and urgent, but Carter avoids rudeness and rashness. He has obviously been listening very carefully for some time to the major voices, and he now makes his own contribution: a strategic renarrating of the standard account of premodern exegesis. In Carter's retelling, key doctrines (Christology and Trinity) loom large, as do certain capital letters (Great Tradition; Christian Platonism). This is a stimulating and accessible account of how to carry on reading the Bible theologically."<br>--<b>Fred Sanders</b>, Torrey Honors Institute, Biola University<br><br>"I love this book! Carter unequivocally starts out with the Christian Platonism that informed the Nicene tradition and unabashedly takes aim at the naturalism that undergirds biblical exegesis in modernity. Carter's contemplative logic is irrefutable: If Scripture participates in the Word of God, then we are surely right to see Christ sacramentally present also in the Old Testament Scriptures."<br>--<b>Hans Boersma</b>, Regent College<br><br>"With comprehensive breadth, Carter argues that a theological interpretation of Scripture that is grounded in the Nicene faith, Christian Platonism, and christological literalism has always been at the heart of the church's great evangelical preaching. Carter links contemporary evangelical practices to the best strands of patristic, medieval, and Reformation exegesis, inviting us to grasp the interaction of exegesis, dogma, and metaphysics as part of a spiritual discipline in which the believing reader is united to Christ by being transformed and purified by the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit. Readable and passionately argued, this volume is for those who want a comprehensive account of retrieving tradition as the way forward for evangelicals."<br>--<b>Annette Brownlee</b>, Wycliffe College, University of Toronto<b>Craig A.

Here are all the classic tales: the greedy dog who loses his bone to his own reflection in the water; the little mouse who pays back the grand lion in a big, big way; and the shepherd's son who thinks it's a good joke to cry "Wolf!" just to see the villagers come running. And, of course, there's that arrogant hare and his racing partner, the slow but steady tortoise. <br> Michael Morpurgo's lively language gives each tale a fresh feel that's perfect for reading aloud and sharing. Emma Chichester Clark's radiant illustrations are bursting with bold colors and cheerful characters. Together they have created a modern classic brimming with fun, which children will enjoy reading and laughing over again and again.</p><p><b>Michael Morpurgo</b> is the children's laureate of Britain. He has written over ninety-five books and won numerous awards, including the Whitbread Award, the Smarties Prize, and the Children's Book Award. Michael and his wife, Clare, run their own charity, Farms for City Children, from their farm in Devon, England.<br><br><b>Emma Chichester Clark</b> is the award-winning illustrator of more than forty collections and picture books, including Michael Morpurgo's <i>The McElderry Book of Aesop's Fables.</i> She is also the author and illustrator of <i>Follow the Leader!</i> She lives in London, England.Kindergarten-Grade 2&#x2013;"One day in March, after a morning of carefree cavorting and capering with her friends on the hillside, Hare was haring her way home along a path when she came across Tortoise." Morpurgo is jocular and colloquial as he adds descriptive details and conversation in retelling 21 tales of the venerable Aesop. Accompanied by humorous watercolor scenes in varied sizes, some tales extend for several pages, while others are complete on two. The concluding lessons, set in larger type, tend to lack the pithiness of those in many older collections, though some are more economical than others. "Obstinacy may look like strength. It rarely is." The reteller seems undecided as to how deadly the fate of some characters should be&#x2013;or at least how specifically it should be stated. In "The Rat and the Elephant," not usually found in Aesop, he says of the cat's pursuit of the rat, "Well, I won't tell you what happened. You'll just have to imagine it." However, he adds a bit of ill fate for the boy who cried "wolf." Unlike most versions, the boy, along with his sheep, is eaten. Morpurgo includes no notes on his sources or choices of tales and alterations. These cheerful, well-crafted offerings will work well for independent reading and reading aloud.&#x2013; <i>Margaret Bush, Simmons College, Boston</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Doors are shut hurriedly, phone calls end abruptly and emails left unanswered. After all, isn&#39;t this a task better handled by the pastor? Perhaps it&#39;s time to re-examine John Wesley&#39;s model of evangelism as a full, natural circle - where it&#39;s a communal beginning point rather than an solitary end. The central motive of authentic evangelism is: Having received a message that&#39;s made all the difference in our lives, we desire to share that message with others in the hope it will transform their lives as well. Wesley models an evangelism that reaches out and welcomes, invites and nurtures, and speaks to both head and heart. &#34;&#34;Evangelism is about relationship,&#34;&#34; the authors write. &#34;&#34;How we are in relationship to God, who is able to transform us into new beings. How we are in relationship to our neighbor, whom we must love like ourselves.&#34;&#34; As one reviewer says, &#34;&#34;Knight and Powe have given us a relational book. They describe the deep connection between John Wesley&#39;s thoughts, Charles Wesley&#39;s hymns, scholarly thinking about evangelism and biblical understandings of the gospel - all in relation to the needs, concerns and hopes of everyday people.&#34;&#34; Learn on your own or as a congregational group from this practical study on living an evangelistic life that demonstrates the transforming power of loving God and neighbor.</p><p>Henry H.

Neither did his two companions, Hera and Poseidon. They were right behind him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Halt in your tracks or you&#x2019;re dead meat, Snackboy!&#x201d; a cruel voice boomed.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d know that voice anywhere. It was Lion Tattoo. That was what Zeus had nicknamed him, anyway. He was the leader of the three half-giants who were after Zeus. They were soldiers in King Cronus&#x2019;s army and stood as tall as trees.<br> <br>Just three days before, they&#x2019;d snatched Zeus from his cave in Crete and brought him here to Greece.

Where would you hide a diamond where no one else would think of looking? What if you found out that the tattoo on your back was worth over a million dollars? You will discover that just about anything is possible in a Roald Dahl story, and here are eleven of his very best.</p><p>"'This is going to be a bit of a shock to you, I'm afraid,' he said." With those words, Patrick Maloney seals his fate. He has no idea that his mousy wife, Mary, isn't about to take his abandonment of their marriage lightly. He never sees the frozen leg of lamb that hits him squarely in the noggin. And he'll never know how tidily Mary cleans up the evidence--by having the local police dine on the murder weapon! The late Roald Dahl, best known for children's novels such as <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i>, also wrote many wonderfully wicked short stories, like the aforementioned "Lamb to the Slaughter," collected in <i>Skin</i>, a succinct, darkly humorous anthology for teen readers. Besides the murderous Mary Maloney, a host of other odd characters will leave teens gasping with surprise or chuckling with guilty laughter. In "The Surgeon," Dr. Robert Sandy is given a priceless diamond in exchange for saving a life, promptly loses it, then recovers it again from the strangest of places. "An African Story" chronicles a lonely mountain hermit's bid for revenge that involves a deadly black mamba snake, and "The Sound Machine" describes how a wacky inventor nearly drives himself mad when he creates a contraption that allows him to pick up noises outside the human range of hearing. There is something for the naughty side of everyone in this <i>Twilight Zone</i>-ish compilation, a recommended read for fans of Dahl's other teen short-story collection, <i>The Umbrella Man</i>.

Wells, Sinclair Lewis, and H.L. Mencken who despised the new worlds of mass production, mass politics, mass culture. These liberals sought to establish a true aristocracy that would serve as a counterpoint to the debasements of modern society. It was then in the seminal 1920s, that the strong strain of snobbery and contempt for the middle class, so pervasive today in the Hamptons, the New Yorker, HBO, and the Sierra Club, first defined liberalism.<br><br>Today&#x2019;s brand of Barack Obama liberalism has gone further, displacing the old Main Street middle class with public sector workers, crony capitalists, and those elite arbiters of style and taste Siegel calls the liberal gentry. <i>The Revolt Against the Masses</i> explains how this came to be and why liberals continue to insist they act on behalf of the best interests of the middle class, even if the damned fools don&#x2019;t know it.</p><p>Fred Siegel is the author, most recently, of <i>The Prince of the City: Giuliani, New York, and the Genius of American Life</i> (2005), which received the cover review in the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>. His previous book, <i>The Future Once Happened Here: New York, D.C., L.A., and the Fate of America&#x2019;s Big Cities</i>, was named by Peter Jennings as one of the 100 most important books about the U.S. in the twentieth century. He has written widely on American and European politics and was described as the historian of the American city&#x201d; in a November 2011 profile in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>.<br><br>The former editor of <i>City Journal</i>, he has written for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, the <i>New York Times, The Atlantic, Commentary, The New Republic, Dissent</i>, and many other publications. He has also appeared widely on TV and radio.<br><br>A former senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington, D.C., Mr. Siegel is currently a scholar in residence at St. Francis College in Brooklyn and a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. <br><br> The roots of American liberalism are not compassion but snobbery. So argues historian Fred Siegel in <i>The Revolt Against the Masses</i>. Siegel traces the development of liberalism from the cultural critics of the post WWI years to the gentry liberals today, and he shows how the common thread is scorn for middle-class Americans and for America itself. This is a stunningly original and convincing book.&#x201d;<br><br> <b>Michael Barone</b>, senior political analyst at the <i>Washington Examiner</i>, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and co-author of <i>The Almanac of American Politics</i><br><br> Fred Siegel&#x2019;s superb <i>The Revolt Against the Masses</i> should be required reading for those who wonder how liberal elites came to dominate our culture, overriding the will of the people. Siegel&#x2019;s book is history at its best and most relevant.&#x201d;<br><br> <b>Roger L. Simon</b>, Academy Award nominated screenwriter, author, and founder of PJ Media<br><br> In <i>The Revolt Against the Masses</i>, Fred Siegel reveals the intellectual underpinnings of today&#x2019;s ascendant gentry liberalism, which leaves old-fashioned liberals, including, I suspect, Siegel himself, politically homeless. The increasingly anti-democratic character of liberalism also undermines much of the reason we became progressives in the first place, which was to help the middle and working classes. The gentry&#x2019;s stridency and hypocrisy what&#x2019;s OK for them is not for everyone else is utterly transforming liberalism today. The progressives portrayed in this book are not so much the heirs of Jefferson or Jackson or even Roosevelt, as they are the American heirs of the worst high-toned Tories.&#x201d;<br><br> <b>Joel Kotkin</b>, author of <i>The Next Hundred Million: America in 2050</i><br></p><h2>The Shirtmaking Workbook: Pattern, Design, and Construction Resources - More than 100 Pattern Downloads for Collars, Cuffs &amp; Plackets</h2><p>ANNOUNCEMENT FROM AUTHOR: March 28, 2017: <b>The link to access the Online Content is found on page 10 in the printed book, under the heading Digital and Online Content.</b>&nbsp;Any further questions, please contact me directly via the Contact form at my website shirtmakingwithdpc.com.

Not a dragon or a mythological beast, but a very real, very destructive monster--crystal meth--that takes hold of seventeen-year-old Kristina Snow and transforms her into her reckless alter-ego Bree. Based on her own daughter&#39;s addiction to crystal meth, Ellen Hopkins&#39; novel-in-verse is a vivid, transfixing look into teenage drug use. Told in Kristina&#39;s voice, it provides a realistic portrayal of the tortured logic of an addict.</p><p>Ellen Hopkins's semi-autobiographical verse novel, <i>Crank</i>, reads like a <i>Go Ask Alice</i> for the 21st century. In it, she chronicles the turbulent and often disturbing relationship between Kristina, a character based on her own daughter, and the "monster," the highly addictive drug crystal meth, or "crank." Kristina is introduced to the drug while visiting her largely absent and ne'er-do-well father. While under the influence of the monster, Kristina discovers her sexy alter-ego, Bree: "there is no perfect daughter, / no gifted high school junior, / no Kristina Georgia Snow. / There is only Bree." Bree will do all the things good girl Kristina won't, including attracting the attention of dangerous boys who can provide her with a steady flow of crank. Soon, her grades plummet, her relationships with family and friends deteriorate, and she needs more and more of the monster just to get through the day. Kristina hits her lowest point when she is raped by one of her drug dealers and becomes pregnant as a result. Her decision to keep the baby slows her drug use, but doesn't stop it, and the author leaves the reader with the distinct impression that Kristina/Bree may never be free from her addiction. In the author's note, Hopkins warns "nothing in this story is impossible," but when Kristina's controlled, high-powered mother allows her teenage daughter to visit her biological father (a nearly homeless known drug user), the story feels unbelievable. Still, the descriptions of crystal meth use and its consequences are powerful, and will horrify and transfix older teenage readers, just as <i>Alice</i> did over 20 years ago. <i>--Jennifer Hubert</i>Ellen Hopkins is the #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of fourteen young adult novels, as well as the adult novels&nbsp;<i>Triangles,&nbsp;Collateral</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Love Lies Beneath</i>.

This latest work from the author of Our Lady of 121st Street "shares many of the traits that have made Mr. Guirgis a playwright to reckon with in recent years: a fierce and questing mind that refuses to settle for glib answers, a gift for identifying with life's losers and an unforced eloquence that finds the poetry in lowdown street talk. [Guirgis brings to the play] a stirring sense of Christian existential pain, which wonders at the paradoxes of faith" (Ben Brantley, <i>The New York Times</i>).</p></p><p><p><b>Stephen Adly Guirgis</b>'s previous plays&#x2015;<i>Our Lady of 121st Street, Jesus Hopped the A Train, and In Arabia, We'd All Be Kings</i>&#x2015;were published by Faber in an omnibus edition in 2003. He lives in New York City.</p>The Last Days of Judas Iscariot <br> ACT 1 <i>Darkness. Rain. From nowhere, a woman emerges from her past.</i> HENRIETTA ISCARIOT: No parent should have to bury a child ... No mother should have to bury a son. Mothers are not meant to bury sons. It is not in the natural order of things. I buried my son. In a potter's field. In a field of Blood. In empty, acrid silence. There was no funeral. There were no mourners. His friends all absent. His father dead. His sisters refusing to attend. I discovered his body alone, I dug his grave alone, I placed him in a hole, and covered him with dirt and rock alone. I was not able to finish burying him before sundown, and I'm not sure if that affected his fate ... I begrudge God none of this. I do not curse him or bemoan my lot. And though my heart keeps beating only to keep breaking--I do not question why. I remember the morning my son was born as if it was yesterday. The moment the midwife placed him in my arms, I was infused with a love beyond all measure and understanding. I remember holding my son, and looking over at my own mother and saying, "Now I understand why the sun comes up at day and the stars come out at night. I understand why rain falls gently. Now I understand you, Mother" ... I loved my son every day of his life, and I will love him ferociously long after I've stopped breathing. I am a simple woman. I am not bright or learn-ed. I do not read. I do not write. My opinions are not solicited. My voice is notimportant ... On the day of my son's birth I was infused with a love beyond all measure and understanding ... The world tells me that God is in Heaven and that my son is in Hell. I tell the world the one true thing I know: If my son is in Hell, then there is no Heaven--because if my son sits in Hell, <i>there is no God.</i> &nbsp; <br> JESUS, <i>carrying a bucket, has approached the woman. He kisses her cheek. She does not notice. They vanish.</i> &nbsp; <br> <i>A courtroom. Court is in session. A woman with wings,</i> GLORIA, <i>rises</i>. &nbsp; <br> GLORIA: Between Heaven and Hell--there is another place. This place: Hope. Hope--is located right over here in downtown Purgatory. JUDGE LITTLEFIELD: <i>Next case!</i> GLORIA: Now, Purgatory, contrary to popular belief, has plumbing, and bodegas, and they even got a movie theater and a little park that people can walk their dogs at. Hope--well it ain't got none a that, and it definitely don't smell good. JUDGE LITTLEFIELD: <i>Next case, Bailiff!</i> GLORIA: I worked here in Hope for two and a half years--thass how I got these wings. And I wouldn't trade nothing for these wings--I can fly with these wings! At night, I fly down to Earth, and I watch my littlest Babyboy sleep. He's seven, and he's got a picture of me on his wall--right in between Shaquille O'Neal and the Incredible Hulk. Then, I go fly uptown to the window of my oldest Babygirl's house and watch my granchild, Little Bit, sleep. Most nights I can see my oldest Babygirl, Tanya, with her feet in a pot of hot water, always studying books; and I'll stick around to see her man, Winston, come home late at night from work,always with a muffin or a hamburger for my Babygirl. Winston's love for my Babygirl is all over his face--I was wrong about him, I always thought he was shifty ... When I get back to Heaven, I tell my husband, DeLayne, all about it. DeLayne don't like to fly, but he likes to hear the stories, and he likes how I look like when I come home from Earth all "windblown" ... Now Hope, it changes with the times, but has stood always as God's gift to the last of his children. It is said that every civilization rearranges the cosmic furniture differently. In biblical times, Hope was an Oasis in the Desert. In medieval days, a shack free of Plague. Today, Hope is no longer a place for contemplation--litigation being the preferred new order of the day.

I say: "Fuck them bitches," 'cuz--you know what--I <i>am</i> a Nag, and if I wasn't a Nag, I wouldn't never made it to be no Saint, and the church wouldn't a had no Father of the Church named Saint Augustine--'cuz I birthed the mothahfuckah, raised him, and when he started messin' up, like, all the time and constantly, I nagged God's ass to save him! I nagged and nagged and nagged and nagged till God got so tired of my shit that he did save my son, and my son--Saint Augustine--he stopped bangin' whores and sippin' on some wine and he became learn-ed, so fuckin' learn-ed that he's known as one of the Fathers of the Church, and you could look that shit up! Go ahead, look it up right now, I'll wait! ... Dass right: "Father Up In This Mothahfuckah"! "Father of the Church"--got a plaque and everything! So if I hadn't been a Nag, All a Y'all niggas woulda been a bastard church, so, sip on dat, bitches! ... Anyways (lemme catch my breaf), okay: As a result of my reputation of having God's ear, a lotta mothahfuckahs pray to me--I have three full-time assistants just to sift through it all. Long story short, I was axed to look into the case of Judas Iscariot by this Irish Gypsy lawyer bitch in Purgatory named Cunningham. She wanted me to do some naggin' to God on Judas's behalf, and, quite frankly, I was impressed by <i>her</i> nagging abilities--'cuz thatbitch nagged my ass day and night for forty days ... But I don't nag for juss any anybody, and I definitely don't nag for no mothahfuckah I don't know, so, I went down to check out Judas for my own self-- &nbsp; <br> <i>And now she is with</i> JUDAS. &nbsp; <br> ( <i>To audience</i>): He looked fuckin' retarded, he wouldn't talk or nuthin'. He didn't seem to hear me, and I'm not someone who has a problem expressing myself. I figured he was fakin', so I did this: ( <i>To</i> JUDAS): Yo, Judas! ... Judas! ... Yo, You Deaf, mothahfuckah? ... Judas, yo! ... ( <i>To audience</i>): I smacked the bitch around a little. &nbsp; <br> MONICA <i>slaps, kicks, shoves.</i> &nbsp; <br> Yo, Helen Keller! Yo, wake up! ... Don't front--I know you could hear me ... ( <i>To audience</i>): Then I started snappin' on his ass. ( <i>To</i> JUDAS): Yo, Judas, you got change for thirty pieces of silver, muthahfuckah?! ... Yo, Judas, how much you pay for that haircut?--thirty pieces of silver?! Yo Judas, why you so "hung" up? C'mon, let's "hang" out. C'mon, bitch, go out on a "limb"! You want a "olive"? C'mon muthahfuckah, have a "olive." Wanna go to the "Olive Garden" restaurant? Day got good "Olive Oil" there ... Ah-aight, fine, come on, Judas, whaddya say you an' me go down to the bar and--betray some mothahfuckahs! Whaddya say?! I know you like betraying! What's up, you ain't in the mood to betray today?! Ah-aight, mothahfuckah, we can just "hang"?! Get it? Hang?! Get it?! Do you get it?! ... Wassamatter?! Hungry?! How 'bout somesupper?! You want some supper, mothahfuckah?! C'on, one last supper, whaddya say?! ( <i>To audience</i>): I couldn't break him. So I sat down next to him. &nbsp; <br> <i>She sits.</i>...</p><h2>YE ARE GODS</h2><p><p><b><b>Progress of the individual depends on the strength of the desire within.</b></b></p><br>Yes, <i>Faith is the substance of things hoped for</i> and the substance of things hoped for is the great spiritual energy out of which all things are composed, all things wich do or can exist in the thoughts of man or in either the tangible realm of earth or the intangible realms of spirit. <br> With this knowledge it is now possible to comprehend that faith is an ELEMENT.

His eyes widened as he gazed down on the crazed activity below.<br><br>&#x201c;This is Earth,&#x201d; Mercy informed their young charge with a tinge of pride. For all its problems, Earth was a fascinating place to visit with the tall buildings that butted up against the sky and people milling about with such purpose, most of them unaware of the spiritual world that surrounded them. More times than she could remember Mercy had lost patience with humans. Those who were considered the apex of God&#x2019;s creations appeared to be slow-�witted and spiritually dull. Yet she loved them and treasured her Earthly assignments.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s New York,&#x201d; Shirley added, resting her chin in her hands as she gazed longingly below. &#x201c;Oh, I do so love this city.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Manhattan, to be more precise,&#x201d; Goodness clarified and ended with a little sigh, indicating that she, too, had missed visiting Earth.<br><br>The four hovered near Times Square, watching the clamoring crowds jockeying for space on New Year&#x2019;s Eve.<br><br>Will&#x2019;s eyes widened as he intently studied the scene taking place in the streets below. &#x201c;Is it always like this&#x2014;�so busy and crowded, I mean?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, no, this is a special night. The people are gathering together to usher in the New Year.&#x201d; Time was a concept reserved for Earth. In heaven it was much different. Consequently, the time restriction placed on the three Prayer Ambassadors when given Earthly assignments had caused more than one problem.<br><br>&#x201c;Did Gabriel want us&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Gabriel,&#x201d; Shirley gasped, and quickly cut him off. &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t exactly know that we&#x2019;ve brought you here. It would probably be best if you didn&#x2019;t mention this short visit to him, okay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, please, it would be best not to let anyone know we&#x2019;ve shown you Earth.&#x201d; It went without saying they&#x2019;d be in all kinds of trouble if Gabriel learned what they&#x2019;d been up to.<br><br>&#x201c;Gabriel means well but he tends to get a little prickly about these things,&#x201d; Goodness explained to their young charge.<br><br>&#x201c;Why is that?&#x201d; Will stared at all three of them.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, you see, we . . . the three of us . . . thought we should give you a bird&#x2019;s-�eye view of Earth and these people God loves so much&#x2014;�strictly for training purposes.&#x201d; Mercy looked to her friends to expound upon their intentions, which were honorable if not a tad bit sneaky.<br><br>This Earthly visitation had been a spur-�of-�the-�moment decision. Mercy had been the one to suggest it. Naturally, Goodness was quick to agree, and after some discussion Shirley had seen the light as well.<br><br>Will, an apprentice angel, had been placed under their charge, and given this honor, it was only right that he get a glimpse of the trials and tribulations that awaited him once he started working as a Prayer Ambassador. The job could be a bit tricky, and the more Will understood the idiosyncrasies of humans, the better he would do once given an assignment from Gabriel.<br><br>Mercy was certain that under their tutorship, Will would make a fine Prayer Ambassador one day. He was young and enthusiastic, eager to learn about Earth and the role he would play.<br><br>As Mercy, who had falsely been labeled a troublemaker, had pointed out, theirs was a duty that required serious dedication. She wasn&#x2019;t alone in believing this. Goodness&#x2014;�oh, poor Goodness&#x2014;�had gotten something of a reputation, too, and Mercy felt partially to blame, but that was another story entirely. Shirley tended to be a bit more on the straight-�and-�narrow path and had worked hard to reform her friends. In fact, Shirley, a former Guardian Angel, had done such a marvelous job, Gabriel had offered to let them train the promising young angel who was with them now.<br><br>Naturally, it was understood that if the three of them accepted this assignment training Will, then of course there would be no hanky-�panky, no tricks, no nothing. All three had agreed. This was a high honor indeed and their intentions were good.<br><br>Now here they were, New Year&#x2019;s Eve in Times Square, in one of the most amazing cities on Earth. Mercy breathed in deeply, savoring the moment. Bringing Will had been a good excuse, but the fact of the matter was that she had missed visiting Earth. It&#x2019;d been a good long while since their last assignment, and she missed the razzle-�dazzle of the big city.<br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t Earth just marvelous?&#x201d; Goodness said, her huge wings fluttering with delight. &#x201c;Just look at all those neon lights. I&#x2019;ve always been especially fond of light.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;As we all are,&#x201d; Shirley reminded them.<br><br>&#x201c;Can we go down there with the people?&#x201d; Will asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Absolutely not.&#x201d; Shirley&#x2019;s loud protest was instantaneous.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think it would hurt anything,&#x201d; Goodness countered, her gaze still fixed on the bright lights of the city below.<br><br>Will glanced from one to the other.<br><br>&#x201c;How will he ever learn about humans if he doesn&#x2019;t have the opportunity to mingle with them?&#x201d; Mercy asked, siding with her dearest friend. Shirley could be such a stickler for rules. Okay, so they&#x2019;d originally promised not to get anywhere close to humans, but this would be a good teaching moment for Will.<br><br>&#x201c;How will he ever learn how to work as a Prayer Ambassador if he doesn&#x2019;t become familiar with humans?&#x201d; Goodness protested.<br><br>Shirley wavered. While she might be opinionated on a number of topics, she could be easily swayed, which was the best part of working with her, Mercy felt.<br><br>&#x201c;Well . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do we hear the humans&#x2019; prayers?&#x201d; Will asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, no,&#x201d; Shirley explained. &#x201c;Only God hears their prayers, and then He talks matters over with Gabriel and then . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then Gabriel passes along those requests to us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And we assist in answering them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;One of our roles is to help humans realize how much they can do for themselves with God&#x2019;s help,&#x201d; Goodness clarified.<br><br>&#x201c;We try as best we can without interfering in their lives,&#x201d; Shirley added quickly, glaring at Goodness and Mercy.<br><br>This was a warning and Mercy recognized it the instant her friend spoke.<br><br>&#x201c;But first, and this is the most important part,&#x201d; Goodness emphasized, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s our duty to teach these humans a lesson. Then and only then are we able to help them with their troubles.<br><br>&#x201c;The real difficulty comes when they don&#x2019;t want to learn.&#x201d; Goodness shook her head because this aspect of the job was often a challenge. &#x201c;Some people seem to want God to step in and do as they ask without making a single contribution to the effort.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t work like that,&#x201d; Mercy said, although she&#x2019;d done a fair bit of finagling to help these poor witless souls. In theory, answering prayers didn&#x2019;t sound the least bit difficult. Unfortunately, humans were sometimes completely dense.<br><br>&#x201c;They can be so stubborn,&#x201d; Goodness said, shaking her head again.<br><br>&#x201c;Strong willed,&#x201d; Shirley agreed.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes, and once&#x2014;�&#x201d; Mercy snapped her mouth closed. It was best not to reveal their past antics for fear it would mislead their young charge into thinking that perhaps he should follow in their footsteps. Gabriel would take exception to that.<br><br>&#x201c;Once?&#x201d; Will pressed. &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Never mind,&#x201d; Shirley said, reading the situation perfectly. &#x201c;Some things are best laid to rest and not discussed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can I go down and be with the crowd?&#x201d; Will asked again. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t say anything to Gabriel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He isn&#x2019;t the only one,&#x201d; Shirley blurted out. &#x201c;I mean, we shouldn&#x2019;t mutter a word of this to anyone in heaven.&#x201d;</p><h2>One Day (Vintage Contemporaries)</h2><p><b>NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE starring ANNE HATHAWAY and JIM STURGESS</b><br><br>It&#x2019;s 1988 and Dexter Mayhew and Emma Morley have only just met.

'You know, actually change something.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What, like "change the world", you mean?'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not the whole entire world. Just the little bit around you.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They lay in silence for a moment, bodies curled around each other in the single bed, then both began to laugh in low, pre-dawn voices. 'Can't believe I just said that,' she groaned. 'Sounds a bit corny, doesn't it?'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A bit corny.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'm trying to be inspiring! I'm trying to lift your grubby soul for the great adventure that lies ahead of you.' She turned to face him. 'Not that you need it. I expect you've got your future nicely mapped out, ta very much. Probably got a little flow-chart somewhere or something.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hardly.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'So what're you going to do then? What's the great plan?'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, my parents are going to pick up my stuff, dump it at theirs, then I'll spend a couple of days in their flat in London, see some friends. Then France-'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very nice-'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then China maybe, see what that's all about, then maybe onto India, travel around there for a bit-'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<i>Traveling</i>,' she sighed. 'So predictable.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What's wrong with travelling?'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Avoiding reality more like.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I think reality is over-rated,' he said in the hope that this might come across as dark and charismatic.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sniffed. 'S'alright, I suppose, for those who can afford it. Why not just say "I'm going on holiday for two years"? It's the same thing.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because travel broadens the mind,' he said, rising onto one elbow and kissing her.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh I think you're probably a bit too broad-minded as it is,' she said, turning her face away, for the moment at least. They settled again on the pillow. 'Anyway, I didn't mean what are you doing next month, I meant the future-future, when you're, I don't know...' She paused, as if conjuring up some fantastical idea, like a fifth dimension. '...<i>Forty </i>or something. What do you want to be when you're forty?'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Forty?' He too seemed to be struggling with the concept. 'Don't know. Am I allowed to say "rich"?'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Just so, so shallow.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Alright then, "famous".' He began to nuzzle at her neck. 'Bit morbid, this, isn't it?'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It's not morbid, it's...exciting.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' 'Exciting!' ' He was imitating her voice now, her soft Yorkshire accent, trying to make her sound daft. She got this a lot, posh boys doing funny voices, as if there was something unusual and quaint about an accent, and not for the first time she felt a reassuring shiver of dislike for him. She shrugged herself away until her back was pressed against the cool of the wall.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, exciting. We're meant to be excited, aren't we? All those possibilities. It's like the Vice-Chancellor said, "the doors of opportunity flung wide..."'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '"Yours are the names in tomorrow's newspapers..."'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<i>Not</i> very likely.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'So, what, are you excited then?'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Me? God no, I'm crapping myself.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Me too. Christ...' He turned suddenly and reached for the cigarettes on the floor by the side of the bed, as if to steady his nerves. 'Forty years old. Forty. Fucking hell.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smiling at his anxiety, she decided to make it worse. 'So what'll you be doing when you're forty?'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lit his cigarette thoughtfully. 'Well the thing is, Em-'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '"Em"? Who's "Em"?'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'People call you Em. I've heard them.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yeah, <i>friends</i> call me Em.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'So can I call you Em?'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Go on then, <i>Dex</i>.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'So I've given this whole "growing old" thing some thought and I've come to the decision that I'd like to stay exactly as I am right now.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dexter Mayhew. She peered up at him through her fringe as he leant against the cheap buttoned vinyl headboard and even without her spectacles on it was clear why he might want to stay exactly this way. Eyes closed, the cigarette glued languidly to his lower lip, the dawn light warming the side of his face through the red filter of the curtains, he had the knack of looking perpetually posed for a photograph. Emma Morley thought 'handsome' a silly, nineteenth-century word, but there really was no other word for it, except perhaps 'beautiful'. He had one of those faces where you were aware of the bones beneath the skin, as if even his bare skull would be attractive. A fine nose, slightly shiny with grease, and dark skin beneath the eyes that looked almost bruised, a badge of honour from all the smoking and late nights spent deliberately losing at strip poker with girls from Bedales. There was something feline about him: eyebrows fine, mouth pouty in a self-conscious way, lips a shade too dark and full, but dry and chapped now, and rouged with Bulgarian red wine. Gratifyingly his hair was terrible, short at the back and sides, but with an awful little quiff at the front. Whatever gel he used had worn off, and now the quiff looked pert and fluffy, like a silly little hat.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still with his eyes closed, he exhaled smoke through his nose. Clearly he knew he was being looked at because he tucked one hand beneath his armpit, bunching up his pectorals and biceps. Where did the muscles come from? Certainly not sporting activity, unless you counted skinny- dipping and playing pool. Probably it was just the kind of good health that was passed down in the family, along with the stocks and shares and the good furniture. Handsome then, or beautiful even, with his paisley boxer shorts pulled down to his hip bones and somehow here in her single bed in her tiny rented room at the end of four years of college. 'Handsome'! Who do you think you are, Jane Eyre? Grow up. Be sensible. Don't get carried away.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She plucked the cigarette from his mouth. 'I can imagine you at forty,' she said, a hint of malice in her voice. 'I can picture it right now.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He smiled without opening his eyes. 'Go on then.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Alright-' She shuffled up the bed, the duvet tucked beneath her armpits. 'You're in this sports car with the roof down in Kensington or Chelsea or one of those places and the amazing thing about this car is it's silent, 'cause all the cars'll be silent in, I don't know, what - 2006?'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He scrunched his eyes to do the sum. '2004-'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And this car is hovering six inches off the ground down the King's Road and you've got this little paunch tucked under the leather steering wheel like a little pillow and those backless gloves on, thinning hair and no chin. You're a big man in a small car with a tan like a basted turkey-'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'So shall we change the subject then?'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And there's this woman next to you in sunglasses, your third, no, fourth wife, very beautiful, a model, no, an ex-model, twenty-three, you met her while she was draped on the bonnet of a car at a motor- show in Nice or something, and she's stunning and thick as shit-'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well that's nice. Any kids?'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No kids, just three divorces, and it's a Friday in July and you're heading off to some house in the country and in the tiny boot of your hover car are tennis racquets and croquet mallets and a hamper full of fine wines and South African grapes and poor little quails and asparagus and the wind's in your widow's peak and you're feeling very, very pleased with yourself and wife number three, four, whatever, smiles at you with about two hundred shiny white teeth and you smile back and try not to think about the fact that you have nothing, absolutely nothing, to say to each other.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came to an abrupt halt. You sound insane, she told herself. Do try not to sound insane. 'Course if it's any consolation we'll all be dead in a nuclear war long before then!' she said brightly, but still he was frowning at her.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Maybe I should go then. If I'm so shallow and corrupt-'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, don't go,' she said, a little too quickly. 'It's four in the morning.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shuffled up the bed until his face was a few inches from hers. 'I don't know where you get this idea of me, you barely know me.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I know the type.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The type?'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I've seen you, hanging round Modern Languages, braying at each other, throwing black-tie dinner parties-'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't even own black-tie. And I certainly don't bray-'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yachting your way round the Med in the long hols, ra ra ra-'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'So if I'm so awful-' His hand was on her hip now.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '-which you are.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '-then why are you sleeping with me?' His hand was on the warm soft flesh of her thigh.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Actually I don't think I have slept with you, have I?'<br>'Well that depends.' He leant in and kissed her. 'Define your terms.' His hand was on the base of her spine, his leg slipping between hers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'By the way,' she mumbled, her mouth pressed against his.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What?' He felt her leg snake around his, pulling him closer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You need to brush your teeth.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't mind if you don't.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'S'really horrible,' she laughed. 'You taste of wine and fags.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well that's alright then. So do you.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her head snapped away, breaking off the kiss. 'Do I?'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't mind. I like wine and fags.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Won't be a sec.' She flung the duvet back, clambering over him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where are you going now?' He placed his hand on her bare back.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Just the bog,' she said, retrieving her spectacles from the pile of books by the bed: large, black NHS frames, standard issue.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The "bog", the "bog"...sorry I'm not familiar...'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stood, one arm across her chest, careful to keep her back to him. 'Don't go away,' she said, padding out of the room, hooking two fingers into the elastic of her underpants to pull the material down at the top of her thighs. 'And no playing with yourself while I'm gone.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He exhaled through his nose and shuffled up the bed, taking in the shabby rented room, knowing with absolute confidence that somewhere in amongst the art postcards and photocopied posters for angry plays there would be a photograph of Nelson Mandela, like some dreamy ideal boyfriend. In his last four years he had seen any number of bedrooms like this, dotted round the city like crime scenes, rooms where you were never more than six feet from a Nina Simone album, and though he'd rarely seen the same bedroom twice, it was all too familiar. The burnt out nightlights and desolate pot plants, the smell of washing powder on cheap, ill-fitting sheets. She had that arty girl's passion for photomontage too; flash-lit snaps of college friends and family jumbled in amongst the Chagalls and Vermeers and Kandinskys, the Che Guevaras and Woody Allens and Samuel Becketts. Nothing here was neutral, everything displayed an allegiance or a point of view. The room was a manifesto, and with a sigh Dexter recognised her as one of those girls who used 'bourgeois' as a term of abuse. He could understand why 'fascist' might have negative connotations, but he liked the word 'bourgeois' and all that it implied. Security, travel, nice food, good manners, ambition; what was he meant to be apologising for?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He watched the smoke curl from his mouth. Feeling for an ashtray, he found a book at the side of the bed. <i>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</i>, spine creased at the 'erotic' bits. The problem with these fiercely individualistic girls was that they were all exactly the same. Another book: <i>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</i>. Silly bloody fool, he thought, confident that it was not a mistake he would ever make.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At twenty-three, Dexter Mayhew's vision of his future was no clearer than Emma Morley's. He hoped to be successful, to make his parents proud and to sleep with more than one woman at the same time, but how to make these all compatible? He wanted to feature in magazine articles, and hoped one day for a retrospective of his work, without having any clear notion of what that work might be. He wanted to live life to the extreme, but without any mess or complications. He wanted to live life in such a way that if a photograph were taken at random, it would be a cool photograph. Things should look right. Fun; there should be a lot of fun and no more sadness than absolutely necessary.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn't much of a plan, and already there had been mistakes. Tonight, for instance, was bound to have repercussions: tears and awkward phone-calls and accusations. He should probably get out of here as soon as possible, and he glanced at his discarded clothes in preparation for his escape. From the bathroom came the warning rattle and bang of an ancient toilet cistern, and he hurriedly replaced the book, finding beneath the bed a small yellow Colman's mustard tin that he flipped open to confirm that, yes, it did contain condoms, along with the small grey remains of a joint, like a mouse dropping. With the possibility of sex <i>and</i> drugs in a small yellow tin he felt hopeful again, and decided that he might stay a little longer at least.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the bathroom, Emma Morley wiped the crescents of toothpaste from the corner of her mouth and wondered if this was all a terrible mistake. Here she was, after four romantically barren years, finally, finally in bed with someone she really liked, had liked since she'd first seen him at a party in 1984, and in just a few hours he'd be gone. Forever probably. He was hardly likely to ask her to go to China with him, and besides she was boycotting China. And he was alright, wasn't he? Dexter Mayhew. In truth she suspected he wasn't all that bright, and a litt...</p><h2>Books and Islands in Ojibwe Country: Traveling Through the Land of My Ancestors</h2><p><p>For more than three decades, bestselling author Louise Erdrich has enthralled readers with dazzling novels that paint an evocative portrait of Native American life.

(Loeb Classical Library No. 287) (Volume II)</h2><p><p>Aristotle, great Greek philosopher, researcher, reasoner, and writer, born at Stagirus in 384 BCE, was the son of Nicomachus, a physician, and Phaestis. He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367&#x2013;47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias&#x2019;s relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343&#x2013;2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip&#x2019;s death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of &#x201c;Peripatetics&#x201d;), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander&#x2019;s death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322.Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows:I. Practical: <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>; <i>Great Ethics</i> (<i>Magna Moralia</i>); <i>Eudemian Ethics</i>; <i>Politics</i>; <i>Oeconomica</i> (on the good of the family); <i>Virtues and Vices</i>.<br>II. Logical: <i>Categories</i>; <i>On Interpretation</i>; <i>Analytics</i> (<i>Prior</i> and <i>Posterior</i>); <i>On Sophistical Refutations</i>; <i>Topica</i>.<br>III.

Should it adhere to grand principles or act on narrow self-interest? Should it partner with other nations or avoid entangling alliances? Americans have been grappling with questions like these throughout the nation's history, and especially since the emergence of the United States as a major world power in the late nineteenth century. <i>America in the World</i> illuminates this history by capturing the diverse voices and viewpoints of some of the most colorful and eloquent people who participated in these momentous debates.</p><p>Spanning the era from the Gilded Age to the Obama years, this unique reader collects more than two hundred documents--everything from presidential addresses and diplomatic cables to political cartoons and song lyrics. It encompasses various phases of American diplomatic history that are typically treated separately, such as the First World War, the Cold War, and 9/11. The book presents the perspectives of elite policymakers--presidents, secretaries of state, generals, and diplomats--alongside those of other kinds of Americans, such as newspaper columnists, clergymen, songwriters, poets, and novelists.

Dr. Aronne&#x2019;s approach, unlike fad diets, focuses on biological factors that cause weight gain. For example, overeating the wrong kinds of food&#x2014;namely highly processed, starchy, sweet, fatty food&#x2014;damages neurons in the brain&#x2019;s appetite center that lead to weight gain.

He provides two different adaptable diets so that readers can personalize a program that works for them. There are meal plans, delicious recipes for protein shakes, soups, sauces, salad dressings, main courses, side dishes and desserts as well as three high-intensity workouts that require no equipment and can be done in less than ten minutes anywhere.

But what is it that makes music so universally beloved and have such a powerful effect on us?</p><p> In this sweeping and authoritative book, Dr. Nolan Gasser&#x2015;a composer, pianist, and musicologist, and the chief architect of the Music Genome Project, which powers Pandora Radio&#x2015;breaks down what musical taste is, where it comes from, and what our favorite songs say about us. </p><p> Dr. Gasser delves into the science, psychology, and sociology that explains why humans love music so much; how our brains process music; and why you may love Queen but your best friend loves Kiss. He sheds light on why babies can clap along to rhythmic patterns and reveals the reason behind why different cultures around the globe identify the same kinds of music as happy, sad, or scary. Using easy-to-follow notated musical scores, Dr. Gasser teaches music fans how to become engaged listeners and provides them with the tools to enhance their musical preferences. He takes readers under the hood of their favorite genres&#x2015;pop, rock, jazz, hip hop, electronica, world music, and classical&#x2015;and covers songs from Taylor Swift to Led Zeppelin to Kendrick Lamar to Bill Evans to Beethoven, and through their work, Dr. Gasser introduces the musical concepts behind why you hum along, tap your foot, and feel deeply. <i>Why You Like It</i> will teach you how to follow the musical discourse happening within a song and thereby empower your musical taste, so you will never hear music the same way again.</p></p><p>NOLAN GASSER is a critically acclaimed composer, pianist, and musicologist.

Specifically, she wanted to understand the microbes that lived inside other organisms like plants and people. But as she began reading books, scholarly articles, blogs, and even attending an online course in an attempt to grasp the microbiology, she quickly realized she couldn&#x2019;t do it alone. <br><br>That&#x2019;s why she enrolled at Columbia University to study Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology. Her stories about being a middle-aged mom embedded in undergrad college life are spot-on and hilarious. But more profoundly, when Bone went back to school she learned that biology is a vast conspiracy of microbes. Microbes invented living and as a result they are part of every aspect of every living thing. This popular science book takes the layman on a broad survey of the role of microbes in nature and illustrates their importance to the existence of <i>everything:</i> atmosphere, soil, plants, and us.</p><p><b>Eugenia Bone</b> is a nationally recognized journalist, food writer, and former president of the New York Mycological Society. She is the author of <i>Mycophilia, The Kitchen Ecosystem, At Mesa&#x2019;s Edge, Italian Family Dining,</i> and <i>Well Preserved</i>. Her books have been nominated for a variety of awards, including a James Beard Award, and her work has appeared in <i>The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Saveur, Food &amp; Wine,</i> and <i>Gourmet,</i> among others<i>.</i>Introduction<br> &nbsp;<br> When I was working on my book about mushrooms, <i>Mycophilia</i>, I asked the mycologist Tom Volk whether bacteria lived inside fungi the way they live in us.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If you ask me,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I think there are probably bacteria in everything.&#x201d; That quote lingered in my mind for years. If bacteria (and, I would later learn, other microscopic organisms) live in everything, did that mean all living things are connected by microbes?<br> &nbsp;<br> I started looking for the answer in books about microbiology. That&#x2019;s where I hit my first snag. I had no microbiology background. Actually, I had almost no biology background at all. I was an English major in college not only because I loved to read and write but also because I was convinced I was hopeless at science and math. So the books I read may have contained the answer, but if they did, I couldn&#x2019;t see it.<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s why I went back to college, at 55 years old, to study biology. Going back to school turned out to be a kind of unraveling of my ego, where I had to deal with being bad at something all the time. It wasn&#x2019;t fun, but it turned out to be necessary, because humility is the entry point for understanding nature. One of the many things I learned in college was the deeper you look, the more complex life is.<br> &nbsp;<br> I also learned that learning is not something you age out of. In fact, it can change everything, no matter how old you are. I went to college to study biology in order to expand my perception of life. And it did, but not in the way I expected. I found out that life itself is a vast conspiracy of microbes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Microbiology, the study of organisms too small to see with the naked eye, is really difficult to comprehend at 55 or any other age. You can&#x2019;t use your senses to perceive these tiny life-forms. Unless you have a microscope, you have no primary observation of them, only secondary sensing. You can see the burp of methane bubbles in Los Angeles&#x2019;s greasy La Brea Tar Pits, but you can&#x2019;t see the archaea that are producing the gas. It&#x2019;s challenging to describe microscopic organisms with words for the same reason. Throughout the process of writing this book, I kept losing track of my voice, the truth-speak that comes directly from the writer&#x2019;s personality. And it occurred to me my problems were founded in the very limited number of adjectives I could use. I mean, the descriptive tools of my trade&#x2014;sight, sound, smell, and touch&#x2014;don&#x2019;t really apply to a bacterium. It seemed like my writerly challenges were synonymous with the challenges I faced in understanding the biology of the microscopic world. My worldview, which includes my way of communicating, is locked into a scale relative to my experience. But the microscopic world<br> operates on a very different scale.<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s a problem, because we can understand nature and ourselves in a deeper way through the lens of a microscope. New discoveries about the impacts of bacteria on our lives occur every day, and while the headlines grab some of us, many of these breakthroughs seem beyond the capacity of most people to understand. But microbiology is where it is happening. This is the age of bacteria, said the evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould, &#x201c;as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Microbiology is like a foreign country. It is very difficult to get around without a basic vocabulary. That&#x2019;s what the biology course I took at Columbia University (my alma mater: I graduated from Barnard College during the Reagan administration) gave me. I acquired the tools necessary to read most papers by microbiologists and understand their presentations. I only developed tourist biologese&#x2014;I couldn&#x2019;t learn enough in a year to master weedy, acronym-stuffed papers&#x2014;but it was enough to get around. And by the second semester, something began to change. I started to see that life, every aspect of life, is sustained by microbes.<br> &nbsp;<br> I experienced revelation after revelation about the impact of microbes on our lives. For example, microbes link the nonliving and living spheres of the planet. They convert chemicals in the atmosphere into food that can travel up the food chain. And they maintain the balance of chemicals on the planet. If lions and elephants went extinct, life would still go on. But as the biologist Tom Curtis wrote in the journal Nature Reviews Microbiology , &#x201c;If we accidentally poisoned the last two species of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, that would be another matter.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I learned that inside our cells reside the remnants of ancient bacteria that convert the oxygen we breathe into energy. They are called mitochondria, and without them, we wouldn&#x2019;t exist. I realized that on the microscopic level, the whole idea of species just falls apart because the pace of microbial evolution is so fast that by the time a scientist has identified a bacterial species and picked out a name, its progeny may have evolved into something else.<br> &nbsp;<br> I found out that mats of microbes, not unlike the orange muck of an intertidal zone, are complex communities composed of microscopic friends and enemies, food makers and degraders of the dead. Ancient microbial mats were the protosoil; they made the colonization of terrestrial Earth possible. I learned that soil is living and dying and dead microbes interacting with a matrix of minerals, upgraded with living and dying and dead plants and animals. Without microbes, soil is just dirt.<br> &nbsp;<br> Another revelation was the notion that feeding and fighting were invented by microbes, and they have been doing those jobs for every organism that came after them on the timeline of life. Microbes deliver nutrients and provide defenses for fungi, plants, and animals. All complex life evolved with microbes that do these jobs. It&#x2019;s the microbes living on our skin that keep pathogens at bay; it&#x2019;s the microbes in our guts that break down the plants we eat.<br> &nbsp;<br> Indeed, my whole understanding of how to take care of my body changed. What we eat feeds the microbes in us. Eat a lot of sugar and you feed microbes that ferment sugar, and their population numbers rise. Sugar fermenters produce molecular by-products like lactic acid, which cause tooth decay. Eat a lot of kale and other species thrive, species that produce other by-products, some of which we depend on to make everything from hormones to neurotransmitters. Our food choices affect the population dynamics of our microbes, which in turn affect us. <br> &nbsp;<br> As my knowledge of microbiology deepened, I became more adept at teasing out the commercial hype and fearmongering in the news. Flesh-eating bacteria, for example, are rare; they&#x2019;re not the microbes to worry about even though an infection by them is truly horrific. The ones to worry about are antibiotic-resistant microbes, which experts estimate will kill 10 million people every year by 2050 unless we find some new medicines. Probiotics, live bacteria and fungi that increase the population of particular species in your gut, work if you suffer from certain kinds of diarrhea, but beyond that, <i>meh</i>. And prebiotics are just bacteria (and fungi) food, mainly fiber that feeds those microbes that produce healthful benefits. An apple is a prebiotic.<br> &nbsp;<br> I came to understand that everything that lives has a microbiome, multiple microbiomes, in fact. There are microbiomes all over plants, microbiomes of the seed and the fruit and the leaves, and microbiomes all over us, in our noses and our ears (one fellow, after dealing with a persistent bacterial infection in one ear, finally had the bright idea to transfer some wax from his healthy ear to his infected ear, and within days his infection disappeared), in our belly buttons, on our hands, in our mouths, between our toes, under our arms, in our genitals&#x2014;everywhere.<br> &nbsp;<br> Microbes even define family. Each of us travels through life in a unique cloud of microscopic debris that we shed from our skin and hair and breath and clothes and farts, an aura composed of a million microscopic particles. Depending on how much time and what degree of contact a person has, two or more people&#x2019;s airborne microbial clouds may homogenize. Couples share<br> more microbes than roommates, and families with young children share the most of all.<br> &nbsp;<br> As I was nearing the end of this book, I met an artist named Andrew Cziraki, who explores social issues using science to construct art forms. I&#x2019;d heard about a piece he was working on called The Holy Water Project. Part of the project included collecting samples of water from holy water fonts, the basins of blessed water often placed inside the entrance of Catholic churches, into which parishioners dunk their fingers before making the sign of the cross. He conducted DNA analyses of each sample in order to determine what organisms were present. He was on the lookout for something that would illuminate the relationship between the community and the church through an analysis of the water. He found bacteria and yeast, and human DNA, but also DNA that correlated with the locations of the New York City churches: carp DNA in the Chinatown church, parasites like roundworms and tapeworms in the church near Pennsylvania Station, &#x201c;which kind of made sense because there are a lot of homeless people sleeping there,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Andrew is interested in this because holy water is where people drop off and pick up microbes. The metaphor of the church, that religion binds the community, is literal here. &#x201c;The community shares itself in this font of microbes,&#x201d; he said. The font is a symbol of sacrament, of purification, &#x201c;and yet,&#x201d; said Andrew, &#x201c;what it really does is transmit. I learned it doesn&#x2019;t matter who or what<br> you are. We are all connected.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> All along I&#x2019;d been sensing it: microbes are bridge organisms that connect the living and nonliving, the soil and plants, the plants and people, and people with each other. But now, I understand. We are all connected to everything by microbial life. We hardly perceive the connections, but we are living them, every day.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Microbia</i> tracks my year studying biology&#x2014;what I learned and what it was like learning it. College life today differs from when I was young. A lot has changed. The science is new, the technology is new, and the pressures and stresses are on a level I don&#x2019;t recall. But much is the same. Students still get morally outraged, they still protest, they still have wickedly funny senses of humor. And everyone is still looking for love, or at least that age-old exchange of microbes we call sex.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I first registered for classes, I was frustrated to discover I couldn&#x2019;t take courses in microbiology without studying biology and chemistry first. I didn&#x2019;t want to wait a few years before I could dig into what most interested me, so I augmented my biology classes with a pretty vigorous schedule of off-campus reading, interviews, seminars, and lectures. The science I report on comes from all those sources.<br> &nbsp;<br> But as the mycologist Nicholas Money wrote in his book <i>The Amoeba in the Room</i>, &#x201c;The more we probe, the more we see.&#x201d; I am quite sure that by the time you read this book, there will be many new microbiological discoveries, probably very significant ones. The flood of data is accelerating, and I could have continued to write indefinitely. So obviously, I had to make compromises. For starters, I didn&#x2019;t write about ocean microbiology; nor did I explore the microbiology of different soils, or get into comparative microbiomes between different kinds of animals and plants, or look in depth into the effects of climate change on microbial life, which is significant. For example, researchers have found that the warming climate leads to loss of microbiome diversity in common lizards, which can undermine the lizard&#x2019;s ability to survive environmental conditions such as, well, a warming climate. All these are fascinating and important subjects, and lots of great science is being done. But I chose to focus on the immediate and familiar: farmland, corn, us.<br> &nbsp;<br> I had a great deal of assistance on this book, from my professors at Columbia and from many microbiologists in the field who kindly clarified&#x2014;and then clarified again&#x2014;what was for me very challenging material. At one point over lunch at a hummus restaurant in New York City, Nicholas Money pointed out that maybe it was something of an advantage to come at microbiology as a naif. I don&#x2019;t know if that is true, though I hope so. Because if I&#x2019;ve achieved what I set out to do, which was to share the euphoria (and the humiliations) of my learning curve and dejargonize the basic current thinking about microbes, then maybe the breakthroughs in microbiology that you read about in the papers will be a bit more accessible and make a bit more sense. We are just starting to understand microbial life. The term microbiome&nbsp; wasn&#x2019;t even coined until 2001, by the molecular biologist Joshua Lederberg. There are a lot of discoveries on<br> the horizon, and it&#x2019;s going to help to have a little microbial literacy under our belts. &#x201c;The planet is half-owned by microbes,&#x201d; sighed the microbiologist Moselio Schaechter, in his rich Italian accent. &#x201c;Which means, if we don&#x2019;t know something about microbes, we don&#x2019;t know half of ourselves.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He&#x2019;s right. For all our technology, we still don&#x2019;t know the half of it. For me, studying invisible life expanded my perspective of the world, and it broadened my definition of life to include organisms that were beyond my ken. But once I understood that these creatures invented living and, as a result, are implicated in every aspect of every life, it raised my own soggy consciousness. I glimpsed another world and found out I share it with everything else on Earth. By looking into the unseen, my sight cleared.</p><h2>Language, Counter-Memory, Practice: Selected Essays and Interviews (Cornell Paperbacks)</h2><p><p>Because of their range, brilliance, and singularity, the ideas of the philosopher-critic-historian Michel Foucault have gained extraordinary currency throughout the Western intellectual community. This book offers a selection of seven of Foucault's most important published essays, translated from the French, with an introductory essay and notes by Donald F. Bouchard. Also included are a summary of a course given by Foucault at College de France; the transcript of a conversation between Foucault and Gilles Deleuze; and an interview with Foucault that appeared in the journal <i>Actuel</i>.</p><p>Professor Bouchard has divided the book into three closely related sections. The four essays in Part One examine language as a "perilous limit" of what we know and what we are. The essays in the second part suggest the methodological guidelines to which Foucault subscribes, and they record, in the editor's words, "the penetration of the language of literature into the domain of discursive thought." The material in the last section is more obviously political than the essays. It treats language in use, language attempting to impart knowledge and power.</p><p>Translated by the editor and Sherry Simon into fluent and lucid English, these essays will appeal primarily to students of literature, especially those interested in contemporary continental structuralist criticism. But because of the breadth of Foucault's interests, they should also prove valuable to anthropologists, linguists, sociologists, and psychologists.</p></p><p><p>Michel Foucault is Professor of History and Systems of Thought at the Coll�ge de France.

She thought God was telling her to give it up for adoption. But ever since the ultrasound, when she finds out it&#x2019;s a boy, he seems more of a reality, and it&#x2019;s harder to imagine giving him up. Bailey Flanigan is trying out for a lead role in Keth Ellison&#x2019;s (Andi&#x2019;s father) newest Hollywood film, Unlocked, opposite teen star Brandon Paul. Andi continues her internal battle, while Bailey tries to concentrate on her movie role despite the way Cody Coleman has been increasingly avoiding her. This fourth book in the &#x201c;Above the Line&#x201d; series concludes this chapter in the lives of the Ellison family and is a great look into the emotional journey of pregnant teens and what it takes to give up a baby for adoption, as well as to trust in God that one is doing the right thing.

Can cooperation persist without the dominance of a single power, such as the United States after World War II? To answer this pressing question, Robert Keohane analyzes the institutions, or "international regimes," through which cooperation has taken place in the world political economy and describes the evolution of these regimes as American hegemony has eroded. Refuting the idea that the decline of hegemony makes cooperation impossible, he views international regimes not as weak substitutes for world government but as devices for facilitating decentralized cooperation among egoistic actors. In the preface the author addresses the issue of cooperation after the end of the Soviet empire and with the renewed dominance of the United States, in security matters, as well as recent scholarship on cooperation.</p></p><p>Winner of the 1989 Grawemeyer Award for Ideas Improving World Order One of Choice&#39;s Outstanding Academic Titles for 1984<b>Robert O.

In my case, I <i>am</i> an etiquette expert, and many people I meet today assume that I grew up enjoying a privileged lifestyle. But nothing could be further from the truth.<br>I was born the fourth of five children in the small town of Haines City, located in Central Florida. My mom, Elsie, left my abusive, alcoholic father (her third husband) when I was just five years old. Unable to support all of us on her own, Mom had to make the heartbreaking choice of sending my three older siblings to live with their father. My mother, my younger brother, and I moved in with my Granny Johnson until Mom could afford a down payment on a government-subsidized house she found in a quaint middle-class neighborhood.<br>Growing up, I didn&#x2019;t attend fancy tea parties, cotillions, or private schools. Life was more than modest; my clothes came from discount stores or I dressed in my cousin&#x2019;s hand-me-downs. The special activities many of my friends enjoyed, including dance classes, piano lessons, and summer vacations, were simply out of the question. I was raised Southern Baptist and spent most of my childhood in church, where I learned to sing and play handbells.<br>Because my dad was a World War II disabled veteran, I was fortunate to attend college thanks to the educational funding I received from the Veterans Benefits Administration. I majored in broadcasting at the University of Florida with the intent to become a TV reporter. But my career aspirations quickly fizzled when I took an internship with CNN in Washington, D.C. Unfortunately, I loathed every minute of it and realized that I wasn&#x2019;t cut out for the cutthroat radio and TV industry.<br>After graduation, I had no idea what I wanted to be when I grew up, so I explored a variety of unique and diverse occupations. I was a sales associate for ladies&#x2019; clothes at an upscale department store, a singer, dancer, and actor at SeaWorld of Florida, an administrative assistant and special events coordinator at the Walt Disney World Dolphin Resort, and a flight attendant with Northwest Airlines.<br>I found happiness in every job I had and I never imagined that life could get even better&nbsp;... until I landed my dream job in 1993. That&#x2019;s when I had the good fortune to be hired as the assistant director of public relations for one of the most luxurious and exclusive hotels in the world&nbsp;&#x2014; The Breakers in Palm Beach, Florida. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the hotel has played host to generations of the rich and famous. My job at the prestigious and palatial Breakers Hotel was a portal into a glamorous, glittery, and elegant world. It was also my finishing school. Who knew that one day this small-town girl would dine and dance at some of the most opulent charity galas in the world or rub elbows with people she read about in magazines and newspapers? As time went on, I eventually took part in The Breakers Annual Executive Etiquette Camp and then went on to take a more extensive business etiquette certification course in Washington, D.C. As a result, I was named the hotel&#x2019;s first protocol officer, which afforded me the opportunity to mix and mingle with some of the world&#x2019;s most interesting and influential people who came to Palm Beach.<br>WHAT PRESENCE IS AND WHAT IT IS NOT<br>The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines presence as &#x201c;a noteworthy quality of poise and effectiveness.&#x201d; Poise is all about balance&nbsp;&#x2014; the way you hold yourself and how you move through the world. It&#x2019;s about paying attention to the details of you, which means accepting, embracing, and taking full advantage of all you have to work with. It&#x2019;s your desire to improve, without the fear of embarrassment or intimidation.<br>The Palm Beach lifestyle could have easily intimidated me, but my sheer desire to be a part of this exciting world helped me quell any hesitation or discomfort I felt. I learned to cultivate my presence and adapt and assimilate into my surroundings just as a chameleon blends in with its environment. I loved working at The Breakers, but like all good things, my tenure there eventually came to an end.<br>My mother often said, &#x201c;A person&#x2019;s life can change in an instant with just one phone call or trip to the mailbox,&#x201d; and she was correct. On a hot, sticky afternoon in August 1998, I unsuspectingly received a phone call that changed my life. My boss called me and in a curt voice he instructed me to report to his office immediately. When I hung up the phone, I broke out into a cold sweat&nbsp;&#x2014; the kind you get right before someone tells you some really bad news. When I entered my boss&#x2019;s office, my heart sank when I saw the director of human resources sitting next to him. My suspicions were immediately confirmed&nbsp;&#x2014; my job position was about to be eliminated.<br>I sat there, calm and composed, but on the inside I felt rage and disappointment. My husband and I had only been married two months; we had a mortgage, car payments, wedding bills, and other financial obligations. But rather than focus on the &#x201c;failure&#x201d; aspects of this experience, I decided to stay poised and face my adversity with grace. A month later, I decided to take the plunge and start my own business&nbsp;&#x2014; The Protocol School of Palm Beach, a company that&#x2019;s still going strong today.<br>Whenever you can stay centered and embrace your own poise during tough times, you tap into your most precious inner resources&nbsp;&#x2014; insight, strength, and depth of character. Presence has its own power source. When you&#x2019;re composed, sufficiently practiced, and self-assured, when you feel strong enough to move mental mountains, you are poised for success.<br>Most of the greatest achievers in the world, from entrepreneurs to athletes and artists, could not have achieved their levels of success without experiencing some adversity. For example, swimmer and Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps has athletic poise and presence. During competitions, he has the ability to develop and maintain a particular state of physical and psychological readiness, both of which he can summon on demand.<br>Whether you&#x2019;re an athlete, astronaut, business owner, or employee, presence is a prerequisite to peak performance. Some people consider presence an innate gift or inborn talent, such as the ability to carry a tune or draw a picture, but anyone can cultivate this quality. It&#x2019;s simply the ability to develop an internal sense of serenity or centeredness, a state of mind that brings enormous peace and inner strength. It&#x2019;s the ability to put yourself in a state of mind where calmness and power intertwine (think extreme self-confidence), allowing you to stand out, perform at your peak, and outshine the competition!<br>Presence isn&#x2019;t something you put on in the morning and take off in the evening; it&#x2019;s a part of your essence. Once it&#x2019;s internalized, it emanates from within, replacing self-doubt and anxiety with self-empowerment. Others are drawn to you because you exude a &#x201c;humble&#x201d; self-confidence and optimism. It&#x2019;s evident that you have something special to offer. In this book I explain how to achieve that &#x201c;special something.&#x201d;<br>Professionals who possess presence are confident without arrogance, composed without stiffness, and kind without pretension, to friends and strangers alike. They are able to express their graciousness with everyone they meet, from corporate leaders to custodians.<br>When you cultivate your own presence you draw admiration from others. Not only will people want to develop friendships with you; they also will want to socialize with you, do business with you, and, in some instances, maybe even date and marry you.

Their time there came to an abrupt end in early January 1954 when they sustained serious injuries from two near-fatal plane crashes in east Africa. While recovering, and back home in Havana, Hemingway wrote his &#x201c;African book,&#x201d; which is, by turns, an adventuresome, comedic, and thoughtful recounting of his final safari. In <em>Under Kilimanjaro</em> &#x201c;Papa&#x201d; colors real people and events with his lively imagination as he demonstrates his inimitable style, his deft wit, and his intelligent curiosity in this autobiographical novel about the land and people he came to love.</p> <p>Completed in 1956, <em>Under Kilimanjaro</em> is part handwritten and part typed, with many of the pages heavily edited in Hemingway&#x2019;s hand. He then left this manuscript, along with those for <em>A Moveable Feast, Islands in the Stream,</em> and <em>The Garden of Eden,</em> in a safe-deposit box in Cuba, often referring to them as his &#x201c;life insurance&#x201d; for his heirs.</p> <p><em>Under Kilimanjaro</em> is the last of Hemingway&#x2019;s manuscripts to be published in its entirety. Editors Robert W. Lewis and Robert E. Fleming believe that &#x201c;this book deserves as complete and faithful a publication as possible without editorial distortion, speculation, or textually unsupported attempts at improvement. Our intent has been to produce a complete reading text of Ernest Hemingway&#x2019;s manuscript. . . .Working on it was both a privilege and a responsibility. . . .Readers of this remarkable work will experience the mingled pleasure of revisiting the familiar and discovering the new.&#x201d;</p> <p>To its readers, <em>Under Kilimanjaro</em> reveals a mature, tender, happy, and reflective Hemingway and offers a compelling, deliberately paced, subtle story of a place and time as only Ernest Hemingway could write it.</p></p><p>Ernest Hemingway was one of America s foremost journalists and authors. A winner of both the Pulitzer Prize (1953) and the Nobel Prize for Literature (1954), Hemingway is widely credited with driving a fundamental shift in prose writing in the early twentieth century. As an American expatriate in Paris in the 1920s, Ernest Hemingway achieved international fame with such literary works as The Sun Also Rises, The Old Man and the Sea, and For Whom the Bell Tolls, which depicts his experience as a correspondent during the Spanish Civil War. Hemingway died in 1961, leaving behind a rich literary legacy. Robert W. Lewis is an engineering safety consultant for Atkins and was formerly a UK expert on two IEC working groups defining new standards for industrial control software, covering distributed control systems (IEC 61499) and PLC software (IEC 61131).

Those who wish to understand art in its broadest sense, as a universal human endowment, need to go beyond modern Western elitist notions that disregard other cultures and ignore the human species&#x2019; four-million-year evolutionary history.<br><br>This book offers a new and unprecedentedly comprehensive theory of the evolutionary significance of art. Art, meaning not only visual art, but music, poetic language, dance, and performance, is for the first time regarded from a biobehavioral or ethical viewpoint. It is shown to be a biological necessity in human existence and fundamental characteristic of the human species.<br><br>In this provocative study, Ellen Dissanayake examines art along with play and ritual as human behaviors that &#x201c;make special,&#x201d; and proposes that making special is an inherited tendency as intrinsic to the human species as speech and toolmaking. She claims that the arts evolved as means of making socially important activities memorable and pleasurable, and thus have been essential to human survival.<br><br>Avoiding simplism and reductionism, this original synthetic approach permits a fresh look at old questions about the origins, nature, purpose, and value of art. It crosses disciplinary boundaries and integrates a number of divers fields: human ethology; evolutionary biology; the psychology and philosophy of art; physical and cultural anthropology; &#x201c;primitive&#x201d; and prehistoric art; Western cultural history; and children&#x2019;s art. The final chapter, &#x201c;From Tradition to Aestheticism,&#x201d; explores some of the ways in which modern Western society has diverged from other societies--particularly the type of society in which human beings evolved--and considers the effects of the aberrance on our art and our attitudes toward art.<br><br>This book is addressed to readers who have a concerned interest in the arts or in human nature and the state of modern society.</p><p>ARTThe author's attempt to substantiate her thesis "that although the arts are a cultural phenomenon, Art might profitably be viewed as a prior, biological one" is thwarted by her muddled approach to biology, anthropology, psychology, cultural histories, and aesthetics. At best, her text is argumentative; more often, it sinks into overblown phraseologies, self-contradictory assertions, and blatant oversights of seminal thought. That artistic behaviors might have a biological basis is an interesting idea, but we shall have to await another work on the subject before evaluating it.Francisca Goldsmith, Golden Gate Univ.

Earlier reformers, progressives of his day, and later New Dealers lamented the nation's resistance to models abroad for correctives to the backwardness of American social politics. <i>Atlantic Crossings</i> is the first major account of the vibrant international network that they constructed--so often obscured by notions of American exceptionalism--and of its profound impact on the United States from the 1870s through 1945.</p><p>On a narrative canvas that sweeps across Europe and the United States, Daniel Rodgers retells the story of the classic era of efforts to repair the damages of unbridled capitalism. He reveals the forgotten international roots of such innovations as city planning, rural cooperatives, modernist architecture for public housing, and social insurance, among other reforms. From small beginnings to reconstructions of the new great cities and rural life, and to the wide-ranging mechanics of social security for working people, Rodgers finds the interconnections, adaptations, exchanges, and even rivalries in the Atlantic region's social planning. He uncovers the immense diffusion of talent, ideas, and action that were breathtaking in their range and impact.</p><p>The scope of <i>Atlantic Crossings</i> is vast and peopled with the reformers, university men and women, new experts, bureaucrats, politicians, and gifted amateurs. This long dur�e of contemporary social policy encompassed fierce debate, new conceptions of the role of the state, an acceptance of the importance of expertise in making government policy, and a recognition of a shared destiny in a newly created world.</p></p><p>The title <i>Atlantic Crossings</i> refers to the cross-pollination of social thinking between the United States and Europe (primarily Britain) in the first half of the 20th century. Princeton history professor Daniel T. Rodgers's extensive narrative shows that while many Americans saw themselves as essentially isolationist, many ideas that influenced their daily lives, such as city planning and concepts of social security, were not homegrown. A network of government planners, academics, and concerned citizens communicated back and forth across the Atlantic; their correspondence was marked by controversy, and an aversion to "non-American" ideas persists in American social planning to this day (Rodgers notes the scuffles over health care reform in the early 1990s as one example). Rodgers has assembled a prodigious mountain of facts, and he's written a credible and comprehensive account of how people on both sides of the Atlantic contributed in sometimes surprising ways to the social reforms we consider utterly American. <i>--Robert McNamara</i>Daniel T. Rodgers is Henry Charles Lea Professor of History at Princeton University.</p><h2>The Landscape Urbanism Reader</h2><p>With populations decentralizing and cities sprawling ever-outward, twenty-first-century urban planners are challenged by the need to organize not just people but space itself. Hence a new architectural discourse has emerged: landscape urbanism.<p>In <i>The Landscape Urbanism Reader</i> Charles Waldheimwho is at the forefront of this new movementhas assembled the definitive collection of essays by many of the field's top practitioners. Fourteen essays written by leading figures across a range of disciplines and from around the worldincluding James Corner, Linda Pollak, Alan Berger, Pierre Blanger, Julia Czerniak, and morecapture the origins, the contemporary milieu, and the aspirations of this relatively new field. <i>The Landscape Urbanism Reader</i> is an inspiring signal to the future of city making as well as an indispensablereference for students, teachers, architects, and urban planners.</p></p><p>Charles Waldheim is the editor of numerous books on landscape urbanism and the associate dean and director of the Landscape Architecture Program at the University of Toronto.One of the great strengths of the book is that while each contributor argues clearly, each has a different prod at the matter, so that by the time one has finished the last of the fourteen essays, one has a strong feeling not only of shape but also of consistency in the landscape urbanism "movement." From the plethora of ideas one can extract three main currents of thought in the new discipline, all of which liberate themselves from the trap of urban form as defined by traditional urban designers. -- <i>Harvard Design, Spring 2007</i><br><br>"a fine collection of contemporary thought on the subject" -- Journal of Architectural Education<br><br>"New Yorks High Line is hard to categorize - it will be a landscaped park but it is also a highly programmed architectural space, while its origins as infrastructure are still a huge part of its appeal. The emerging field of landscape urbanism is one way to define such a project and the growing numbers of likeminded proposals around the country." --The Architects Newspaper<br><br>"Required reading." --Architecture Magazine</p><h2>Nikkei Cuisine: Japanese Food the South American Way</h2><p><p>At its simplest, Nikkei cuisine is the cooking of the Japanese diaspora. Japanese immigrants have found themselves in a variety of cultures and contexts, but have often maintained a loyalty to their native cuisine. This has required local adaptation over the last 100 years: the so-called Nikkei community has embraced a new country&#x2019;s ingredients and assimilated these into their cooking using Japanese techniques. Nikkei cooking is found wherever in the world Japanese immigrants and their descendants are. But, for historical reasons, two countries have had substantially more Japanese immigrants than the rest of the world &#x2013; Brazil and Peru.<br><br> Nikkei cooking has gained popularity in Europe and the USA due to the influence of chefs Nobu Matsuhisa and Toshiro Konishi; the last two decades have seen the emergence of a number of outstanding, creative Nikkei chefs and restaurants all over the world &#x2013; including Pakta in Barcelona by Albert Adria. &nbsp;This stunningly photographed cookbook includes 100 Nikkei recipes, including 10 contributed recipes from top Nikkei chefs from around the world such as celebrated chefs Toshiro Konishi and Mitsuharu Tsumura ('Micha') from Peru, Tsuyoshi Murakami from Brazil, Jorge Munoz &amp; Kioko Li of Pakta in Barcelona and Jordan Sclare &amp; Michael Paul of Chotto Matte in London.<br><br><i>Nikkei Cuisine</i> is a ground-breaking cookery book and a must-have for anyone with an interest in Japanese or South American cooking, as well as for those keen to discover cutting-edge cookery and flavours. The recipes range from the simpler Nikkei family favourites (the dishes eaten at home) to the more elaborate and elegant Nikkei dishes served in restaurants around the world.</p></p><p><p>Born of Japanese and Italian parentage, <b>LUIZ HARA</b>�&nbsp;was raised by his Japanese grandmother in S�o Paulo, Brazil, until the age of 19, when he moved to the UK.

The Nile had crested a few days earlier, and its entire shallow valley shone with damp brilliance. Beneath the purple silhouetted swoop of storks, the clang of an eager blacksmith mingled with the call to prayer and the smell of baking bread. That particular morning there was another smell too, something sharp and unfamiliar at first. No one could put a name to it until, bleary-�eyed and still warm from bed, they stepped out into the day and saw that neat black thread of smoke rising from the Ibn Ezra Synagogue.<br><br>Before long a crowd gathered in the courtyard of the synagogue: women and children, dyers and glassblowers, pharmacists, money changers, and fishermen. For most, this was their first glimpse of the newly reconstructed synagogue. Still unfinished, still unconsecrated by prayer, and already this beautiful new building was blackened by fire. It was a terrible thing, and yet it could have been worse. Apart from the smell of smoke in the prayer hall, the damage was limited to a shadow of soot beneath the scaffolding where the fire had started.<br><br>Who would do such a thing? Some more hopeful members of the crowd thought they saw signs of an accident, a stray coal or a clumsy housewife. Others insisted that the fire would turn out to be the work of petty vandals. And then there were those who regarded it as something more sinister, a reminder and portent of things to come, not that anyone needed reminding. Who could forget the reign of al-�Hakim the Horrible? Who did not shiver to think of that sister-�loving false prophet who had destroyed nearly a dozen synagogues and churches, including the original Ibn Ezra? Who could forget that hateful despot who had gone so far as to outlaw molokhia, the leafy green vegetable also known as Jew&#x2019;s mallow? He was gone now, al-�Hakim, dead for nearly twenty years, and the current caliph, al-�Mustansir, had proven himself to be a friend of the Jews. Still, one never knew.<br><br>This discussion about the cause of the fire went on for some time. And all the while, Ali ibn al-�Marwani was standing at the edge of the courtyard, waiting for the right moment to step forward. Fingering the sleeve of his robe, he tried to recall what he had been told to say, whom he was supposed to seek out. But in the effort to remember the directions to the synagogue&#x2014;�a right at the old palace, a left at the Abu Serga Church&#x2014;�he had forgotten what he was supposed to do when he got there.<br><br>Eventually, as the crowd was beginning to disperse, someone noticed him. All at once, he felt the balance of attention shift. They were talking about him&#x2014;�an unfamiliar boy, thin cotton robe and cheap sandals, no older than thirteen&#x2014;�and as the murmur of insinuation collected to a boil, a circle formed around him. For a moment, Ali was alone in the middle of the courtyard. Then a young man stepped forward and grabbed him by the scruff of his robe.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you do this?&#x201d; the young man demanded, forcing Ali&#x2019;s gaze toward the remnants of the fire. Ali opened his mouth, but he was not able to speak.<br><br>&#x201c;It is said that a thief returns to the scene of his crime,&#x201d; the young man continued. &#x201c;Could not the same be said for our arsonist?&#x201d;<br><br>There was a buzz of agreement followed by a few muttered calls for revenge.<br><br>&#x201c;Why does he not respond? Why did he not announce himself? What is his business with us?&#x201d;<br><br>The young man paused and looked out over the crowd as if expecting an answer. Instead, the silence was punctured by the sound of an older man clearing his throat.<br><br>&#x201c;Shemarya the Pious,&#x201d; someone said and everyone stepped aside, making way for a hunched man with a mane of white hair tangled in his beard. When he got to the center of the circle, he addressed himself to the young man, who was still holding Ali by the scruff of his robe.<br><br>&#x201c;Amram,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Is it not written that we should judge everyone from his most favorable side?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Father, but would you not&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Release him,&#x201d; Shemarya the Pious said, then turned to Ali.<br><br>He did not smile, but his eyes crinkled with compassion.<br><br>&#x201c;Tell us your business here, my child.&#x201d;<br><br>There was a long silence before Ali could bring himself to speak.<br><br>&#x201c;I have a message from Abu Saad,&#x201d; he said finally.<br><br>The crowd grew ever more silent as Ali produced a note from the sleeve of his galabiya. Abu Saad was chief adviser to the caliph and the Jews&#x2019; most important ally inside the palace. Correspondence from Abu Saad was always important, but on this day of uncertainty the Jews of Fustat were particularly eager for his reassurance.<br><br>&#x201c;You are not Abu Saad&#x2019;s usual messenger,&#x201d; Shemarya the Pious observed. &#x201c;What is your name, my child?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ali ibn al-�Marwani.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You are Muslim.&#x201d;<br><br>Ali nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;And your father&#x2019;s profession?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He was a water carrier, but he died before I was born. I live with my mother&#x2019;s brother near Bab Zuwayla.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;May God protect the orphans,&#x201d; Shemarya the Pious said, and a murmur of assent rippled through the crowd.<br><br>Once Ali&#x2019;s business, name, faith, and patrimony were established, Shemarya the Pious unfolded Abu Saad&#x2019;s note and read through it twice. He closed his eyes for a moment to think; then he pulled a reed pen from his pocket, requested a bit of ink, and composed a reply on the reverse.<br><br>&#x201c;This is for Abu Saad,&#x201d; he said, handing the note back to Ali. &#x201c;You must not give it to anyone else. Do you understand?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Ali said, and he returned the note to the folds of his sleeve.<br><br>Shemarya the Pious concluded the exchange by addressing himself to the assembled crowd, though his words were clearly intended for his son Amram.<br><br>&#x201c;We should not stoop to unfounded accusations, especially not today. There is too much work to be done.&#x201d;<br><br>While the Jews of Fustat scrubbed soot off the light-�gray stones of their synagogue, Ali ran back to Qahira with the message for Abu Saad. Through the jumbled crowd of pack animals outside Bab Zuwayla, past his uncle&#x2019;s house, past the market of the coppersmiths and the students congregated around al-�Azhar, darting between food vendors, camels, magicians, and slaves, he cut across the market of the money changers and made his way around to the back entrance of Abu Saad&#x2019;s palace.<br><br>Larger than all but the most magnificent of mosques, the residence of Abu Saad was one of the grandest buildings in all of Qahira, its outer walls decorated with turquoise banners and a thick band of calligraphy carved so intricately that the letters looked like a nest of snakes. Earlier that morning Abu Saad&#x2019;s usual messenger&#x2014;�Ali&#x2019;s neighbor&#x2014;�had lifted his head from his sickbed to describe the palace&#x2019;s back entrance, a tall cedar door at the end of an unremarkable side street, home to a butcher, a knife sharpener, and a few unscrupulous-�looking money changers. Approaching the entrance for the second time that morning, Ali caught his breath, stepped up to the door, and knocked. He waited for some time before knocking again, louder this time. As he did, the door swung open to reveal an enormous guard wearing a white linen robe trimmed with turquoise of the same shade as the banners hanging outside. This guard was much more imposing than the one Ali had spoken with earlier that morning, and much uglier.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have a message for Abu Saad, from Shemarya the Pious.&#x201d;<br><br>The guard stuck out his hand and Ali took a small step backward.<br><br>&#x201c;Shemarya said I must not give the message to anyone but Abu Saad himself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;To you, I am the same as Abu Saad.&#x201d;<br><br>Ali stared at the guard&#x2019;s meaty palm and felt the sun on the base of his neck. As he tightened his grip on the note, a drop of sweat slid down the valley of his spine.<br><br>&#x201c;Shemarya said I must not give the message to anyone but Abu Saad himself,&#x201d; Ali said again. It was a bold request, but he had his instructions and he intended to follow them.<br><br>&#x201c;Abu Saad himself,&#x201d; the guard growled.<br><br>A few moments later, Ali found himself standing less than an arm&#x2019;s length from Abu Saad, the chief adviser to the caliph. He was a short man with an enormous stomach, and he wore a fine purple silk caftan embroidered on the collar with white and turquoise flowers. He introduced himself, took the note from Ali&#x2019;s outstretched hand, and returned several minutes later with a tightly folded piece of vellum.<br><br>&#x201c;The note is for Shemarya the Pious,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And this is for you.&#x201d;<br><br>A servant stepped forward and presented Ali with a silver cup, filled to the brim with a deep-�red liquid.<br><br>&#x201c;Pomegranate juice,&#x201d; Abu Saad explained, noticing Ali&#x2019;s hesitation. &#x201c;In appreciation of your discretion. May it give you strength.&#x201d;<br><br>Over the course of the day, Ali ran seven times back and forth between Fustat and Qahira. Dodging donkey carts, ref�use, and stray dogs, he delivered dozens of messages from the Jews of Fustat to their coreligionists, business partners, and other supporters throughout the city. Ali carried notes to tradesmen, qadis, merchants, and priests. Cutting through rank back alleys slick with sewage, squirming under locked gates, and sneaking across the shaded courtyards of great mansions, he delivered messages to the Hanging Church, the market of the glassblowers, the Garden of Kafur, and the secret inner sanctums of al-�Azhar. In one day, Ali saw more of his native city than he had seen in his entire life.<br><br>All day, Ali performed his duties with the utmost discretion and care. He always announced himself forthwith, never lingered or made inappropriate eye contact, and never once considered opening any of the notes he was carrying. Then, at the end of the day, as he ran back to Fustat with a final note from Abu Saad, Ali tripped over an exposed root and cut his hand on a pebble. He didn&#x2019;t notice the wound at first, but when he pulled Abu Saad&#x2019;s note from his sleeve, he saw that the top edge of it was smeared with red.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; he mumbled to Shemarya the Pious, mortified by the sight of this elegant paper stained with his own sticky blood.<br><br>Sinking into a dim corner of the courtyard, Ali watched the note pass among the council that governed the affairs of the Jewish community, from Shemarya to his sons, Amram and Ephraim, to a Tunisian spice merchant known as Ibn Kammuna, then on to Doctor Mevorakh, the scribe, the head cantor, and finally to al-�Zikri, a barber who also served as guardian of the synagogue. Ali held his breath, bracing himself for their censure, but none of the men seemed to notice the bloodstain. They were more interested in the message itself.<br><br>While the council deliberated, speaking in hushed but urgent voices, Ali relaxed and let his gaze wander along the fa�ade of the newly reconstructed synagogue. Aside from the subtle stonework just below the roof, the building&#x2019;s only exterior decoration was the main entrance, two heavy wooden slabs adorned with the image of a grapevine twisting around four large Hebrew letters arranged in a square. Lost in his inspection of the mysterious script, Ali did not notice that a silence had fallen over the council. When he glanced up, he saw that the men were all looking at him.<br><br>&#x201c;We have a proposal,&#x201d; said Shemarya the Pious.<br><br>&#x201c;We have decided,&#x201d; Ephraim ibn Shemarya continued, &#x201c;that it would be beneficial to employ a night watchman for the synagogue. We have al-�Zikri, of course, but he cannot be responsible for watching the building day and night.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Since you have proven yourself to be trustworthy and discreet,&#x201d; Ibn Kammuna said, &#x201c;we would like to offer you the position. In addition to three dinars a month, you would be free to live in the old schoolroom at the other end of the courtyard.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I imagine it should suffice for your purposes,&#x201d; al-�Zikri added as he motioned toward the small structure, &#x201c;and with a fresh coat of paint it will be very hospitable.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Ali said, unsure how else to respond.<br><br>Three dinars was more than he made in six months as a water carrier, and the schoolroom was larger than the house he currently shared with his uncle&#x2019;s family. It was an unexpected and generous offer, a stroke of good fortune, but Ali had learned to be distrustful of fate and, although the Jews had treated him well, he knew nothing of them or their practices. While he could not see anything wrong with the offer, he was not ready to accept the position outright. Naturally, the Jews of Fustat understood such caution. It was to be expected, valued even, and only confirmed the good sense of Abu Saad&#x2019;s suggestion.<br><br>&#x201c;There is no need to make your decision now,&#x201d; said Doctor Mevorakh. &#x201c;Sleep will be your best counsel.&#x201d;<br><br>There was a murmur of agreement, and it was decided that Ali should send word the next morning with his answer.<br><br>Ali stayed up late that night, staring at the mud walls of the storage room where he slept. He wanted very much to leave his uncle Rashid and aunt Fatimah&#x2019;s house. Although he was fond of his cousin Fawziyah and would always be indebted to the family that had raised him, life in his uncle&#x2019;s house had been quite difficult for some time now. A few years earlier, an errant donkey kick had crippled his uncle&#x2019;s right hand, leaving him unable to practice his trade as a blacksmith. The family became dependent on charity, and Ali was forced to work as a water carrier. Meanwhile, Uncle Rashid had grown increasingly bitter. He spent most of his days at the neighborhood caf�, chewing seeds, drinking palm wine, and gambling away any money he was able to obtain.<br><br>The Jews&#x2019; offer seemed like the perfect solution to Ali&#x2019;s problems. Even so, he was wary. He didn&#x2019;t know if he could trust them&#x2014;�he didn&#x2019;t know anything about them, really&#x2014;�and either way, he wasn&#x2019;t certain how his uncle would react. Following the night shadows across the ceiling of the storage room, Ali prepared a long list of answers to the questions his uncle might ask. In the end, however, all that was unnecessary. Once he learned how much Ali would be paid, Uncle Rashid had only one question; whether he would continue to contribute to the welfare of the poor relations who had so kindly taken him in.<br><br>&#x201c;A small price,&#x201d; he said as he chewed over a mouthful of taamiya and pickled turnip, &#x201c;to repay all we&#x2019;ve done for you.&#x201d;<br><br>Eventually, Ali agreed to provide his uncle&#x2019;s family with one dinar a month, a portion of which was to be reserved for the dowry of his cousin Fawziyah. It was nearly twice as much as he currently contributed to the household and he knew most of the money would disappear into his uncle&#x2019;s vices. Still, his uncle was right. It was a small price to repay all they had done for him.<br><br>&#x201c;I will be forever indebted to your kindness,&#x201d; Ali said, and so it was settled. He sent word to Fustat, and the following afternoon he departed.<br><br>Waving farewell from atop his donkey cart, Ali felt as if he were a prince leaving home for distant battle. It was a luxury for him, traveling by cart. His possessions&#x2014;�a few changes of clothes, some bedding, a ba...</p><h2>Yearning: Living Between How It Is How It Ought to Be</h2><p>Does God want us fulfilled? Popular psychology says we should be fulfilled. Advertisements tease us with dozens of ways we can be fulfilled. Many preachers and book promise Christian fulfillment. But in this surprising (and surprisingly liberating) book, Craig Barnes suggests we weren't created to be whole or complete. With a fresh reading of the early chapters of Genesis, he says that much of our pain and disillusionment arises from wrong expectations of the gospel and of life. Echoing comedian Bob Newhart, Barnes "would like to make a motion that we face reality." He candidly draws from his own experience as a son, a student, a husband, a father and a pastor to help us see what we all know but are so reluctant to say aloud--that biblical living will not save us from crises or unfulfillment. Barnes writes for anyone who knows that faith must be tough enough to "hold up in the emergency rooms of life." But he doesn't merely help us face reality. He helps us see how our needs and limitations are gifts, the best opportunities we have to receive God's grace. Because of that, <em>Yearning</em> may be the most honest <em>and</em> the most helpful book you'll read this year.</p><p>In this book, Barnes suggests we weren&#39;t created to be whole or complete.

Since the last edition published in 2007, there have been dramatic changes in cataloging systems from the Library of Congress. The most notable being the shift from AACR2 to Resource Description and Access (RDA) as the new standard developed by the Library of Congress. With the help of the coauthor, Athena Salaba, this text is modified throughout to conform to the new standard.<br><br>Retaining the overall outline of the previous edition, this text presents the essence of library cataloging and classification in terms of three basic functions: descriptive cataloging, subject access, and classification. Within this framework, all chapters have been rewritten to incorporate the changes that have occurred during the interval between the third and fourth editions. In each part, the historical development and underlying principles of the retrieval mechanism at issue are treated first, because these are considered essential to an understanding of cataloging and classification. Discussion and examples of provisions in the standards and tools are then presented in order to illustrate the operations covered in each chapter.<br><br>Divided into five parts&#x2014;a general overview; record production and structure, encoding formats, and metadata records; RDA; subject access and controlled vocabularies; and the organization of library resources&#x2014;each part of the book begins with a list of the standards and tools used in the preparation and processing of that part of the cataloging record covered, followed by suggested background readings selected to help the reader gain an overview of the subject to be presented. This book is the standard text for the teaching and understanding of cataloging and classification.</p><p>Dr. Athena Salaba is associate professor in the School of Library and Information Science at Kent State University.<br><br>The late Lois Mai Chan was formerly Professor Emerita in the School of Library and Information Science at the University of Kentucky, Lexington. She was author of eight books and numerous articles and co-editor of two collections in the areas of knowledge organization and subject indexing. In 1989, Chan was awarded the Margaret Mann Citation for Outstanding Achievement in Cataloging and Classification given by the American Library Association, and in 1992, she received the Distinguished Service Award from the Chinese-American Librarians Association.[T]he book is a great resource and collects a lot of cataloging information that is otherwise dispersed. It would be a valuable resource to a new cataloger or any cataloger needing help interpreting RDA. It is a text for catalogers in any type of library and for any type of material (including non-traditional materials). It should be found in every library school library as a reference resource.

Valenzuela argues that schools subtract resources from youth in two major ways: firstly by dismissing their definition of education and secondly, through assimilationist policies and practices that minimize their culture and language. A key consequence is the erosion of students&#x2019; social capital evident in the absence of academically oriented networks among acculturated, U.S.-born youth.</p><p>Angela Valenzuela received the Outstanding Book Award for her book entitled: Subtractive Schooling: U.S.-Mexican Youth and the Politics of Caring at the American Educational Research Association's Annual Meeting held in New Orleans, Louisiana, April 24-28th. The Award was established for the best book-length publication in educational research and development. To be considered for the Award, a book must be concerned with the improvement of the educational process through research or scholarly inquiry and must have a research base. The author or another scholar may nominate a book as specified in the Educational Researcher journal received by all AERA members. Committee Chair, P. David Pearson of Michigan State University will present Dr. Valenzuela with the Award. Among past recipients of the Award are: Stephen Jay Gould and Carol Gilligan; James C. Coleman and Thomas Hoffer; Burton R. Clark and David F. Labaree; David Tyack, Elizabeth Hansot, Teun A. Van Dijk, and Idit Harel; Joan DelFattore and Jonathan Kozol; and David C. Berliner and Bruce Biddle. <p>The book was selected because, according to P. David Pearson, the head of the selection committee, "It takes a provocative cluster of issues in American education -- race, power, and language -- beyond the usual rhetoric and adopts a fresh and thoughtful perspective." It also uses a complex array of methodological tools to address a complex issue. Most important, the voice of the researcher is clear, strong, and compelling. "This is a book that dares you to read it," Pearson added, "and once inside, it will not let you go until you have finished it." </p><p>--American Educational Research Association Press Release, April 26, 2000</p><p>Angela Valenzuela is Professor in Curriculum and Instruction and Center for Mexican American Studies at the University of Texas, Austin.</p></p><h2>Analysis II: Third Edition (Texts and Readings in Mathematics)</h2><p><p>This is part two of a two-volume book on real analysis and is intended for senior undergraduate students of mathematics who have already been exposed to calculus. The emphasis is on rigour and foundations of analysis. Beginning with the construction of the number systems and set theory, the book discusses the basics of analysis (limits, series, continuity, differentiation, Riemann integration), through to power series, several variable calculus and Fourier analysis, and then finally the Lebesgue integral. These are almost entirely set in the concrete setting of the real line and Euclidean spaces, although there is some material on abstract metric and topological spaces. The book also has appendices on mathematical logic and the decimal system. The entire text (omitting some less central topics) can be taught in two quarters of 25&#x2013;30 lectures each. The course material is deeply intertwined with the exercises, as it is intended that the student actively learn the material (and practice thinking and writing rigorously) by proving several of the key results in the theory.&nbsp;</p></p><p>Terence&nbsp;"Terry"&nbsp;Chi-Shen Tao,&nbsp;FAA&nbsp;FRS, is an Australian mathematician.

Many consultants, however, fail to understand that perceived value is the basis of the fee, or that they must translate the importance of their advice into long-term gains for the client in the client&#39;s perception. Still others fail to have the courage and the belief system that support the high value delivered to clients, thereby reducing fees to a level commensurate with the consultant&#39;s own low self-esteem. Ultimately, says Weiss, consultants, not clients, are the main cause of low consulting fees.</p><p><p><b>Value-Based Fees</b> </p><p>When <i>Value-Based Fees</i> was first published in 2002, it quickly became the go-to book for consultants who needed a reliable resource for determining how much they should charge their clients for their services. </p><p>In this thoroughly revised edition of his classic book, Alan Weiss shows how consulting fees are dependent on only two things: value provided in the perception of the buyer and the intent of the buyer and the consultant to act ethically.

Combining adaptive and cognitive approaches, it is a comprehensive analysis of religion&#39;s evolutionary significance, and its inextricable interdependence with language. It is also a detailed study of religion&#39;s main component, ritual, which constructs the conceptions that we take to be religious and therefore central in the making of humanity&#39;s adaptation. The text amounts to a manual for effective ritual, illustrated by examples drawn from a range of disciplines.</p><p>"Roy Rappaport's book is an admirable blend of rich information and analytical power.

Hans Kung, Universitat Tubingen<br><br>"Once in a great while there appears a book that alters the dimensions of the intellectual field to which it speaks. This is such a book. In it, the author marshalls insights drawn from ethnography and ecology, the cybernetics of communication, comparative religion and semiotics to establish the centrality of ritual for what it means to be human. In clear and elegant prose, Roy Rappaport calls into question many of the ways we think about the world. The result is an intellectual adventure of the first magnitude."

Blakeman covers key areas, from marketing plans, branding/positioning, and creative briefs to copywriting, design, and considerations for each major media format. Throughout, she explores visual and verbal tactics, along with the use of business theory and practices, and how these affect the development of the creative message. This user-friendly introduction walks students through the varied strands of IMC, including advertising, PR, direct marketing, and sales promotion, in a concise and logical fashion.</p><p>Robyn Blakeman is associate professor of Advertising Design at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. She is the author of several books, including Strategic Uses of Alternative Media, Advertising Campaign Design, Nontraditional Media in Marketing and Advertising, and The Brains Behind Great Ad Campaigns (co-authored with Margo Berman). She was responsible for designing and developing the first online integrated marketing communication graduate certificate and online integrated marketing communication graduate program in the country.This is a textbook written by an author with a lot of professional experience. Blakeman&#x2019;s book explains many useful IMC concepts and practices in easy-to-understand language. This book also contains many practitioners&#x2019; insights into how to plan and execute a successful IMC campaign. (Kenneth C. C. Yang, University of Texas at El Paso)<br><br>The third edition of Integrated Marketing Communication is a big step forward in the literature on our discipline. Robyn Blakeman covers all communication categories, including social media, alternative media, digital media, public relations, sales promotion, direct marketing, and all forms of traditional media. The focus is on how to successfully use IMC to build your brand. The key, according to Blakeman, is relationship building with individual customers, one-by-one. The third edition of the text tells readers how this is done. Blakeman tells us when and why IMC works. And, just as importantly, she tells us when and why IMC fails. This is an important read for IMC practitioners and scholars alike. (Archie Sader, West Virginia University)<br><br>Blakeman explains IMC in ways that undergraduates can grasp and implement both in the classroom and in their career paths. While updating the foundational constructs, the third edition also provides a holistic perspective of both strengths and problems inherent in IMC and media. The chapters on social, mobile, and alternative media alone make the text worth considering, as do the case studies included in each chapter. True to the title, this text is an innovative encounter with IMC from idea to implementation for both student and faculty.

It describes a distinctive sound culture that gave birth to the sound recording and the transmission devices so ubiquitous in modern life. With an ear for the unexpected, scholar and musician Jonathan Sterne uses the technological and cultural precursors of telephony, phonography, and radio as an entry point into a history of sound in its own right. Sterne studies the constantly shifting boundary between phenomena organized as "sound" and "not sound." In <i>The Audible Past, </i>this history crisscrosses the liminal regions between bodies and machines, originals and copies, nature and culture, and life and death. <p></p><p>Blending cultural studies and the history of communication technology, Sterne follows modern sound technologies back through a historical labyrinth. Along the way, he encounters capitalists and inventors, musicians and philosophers, embalmers and grave robbers, doctors and patients, deaf children and their teachers, professionals and hobbyists, folklorists and tribal singers. <i>The Audible Past </i>tracks the connections between the history of sound and the defining features of modernity: from developments in medicine, physics, and philosophy to the tumultuous shifts of industrial capitalism, colonialism, urbanization, modern technology, and the rise of a new middle class.</p><p>A provocative history of sound, <i>The Audible Past</i> challenges theoretical commonplaces such as the philosophical privilege of the speaking subject, the visual bias in theories of modernity, and static descriptions of nature. It will interest those in cultural studies, media and communication studies, the new musicology, and the history of technology.</p></p><p>"Jonathan Sterne&#x2019;s The Audible Past boldly stakes out a largely neglected but important topic, the history of sound in modern life."&#x2014;John Durham Peters, author of Speaking into the Air: A History of the Idea of Communication <p>"Jonathan Sterne confronts what is certainly the most challenging topic in the study of auditory culture&#x2014;what happened when modern technologies came crashing into ways of sound making, communicating and listening&#x2014;with outstanding results. Through disciplined arguments bolstered by plenty of original research, and with refreshing critiques of many cherished notions, The Audible Past forms a basis from which to address central questions of communication studies, musicology and music history, film sound and media studies, perception and culture, all those areas where listening and sound impinge upon cultural history and theory."&#x2014;Douglas Kahn, author of Noise, Water, Meat: A History of Sound in the Arts </p><p>"Jonathan Sterne&#x2019;s The Audible Past has come along to set the record straight on the cultural origins of sounds and systems, machines and the mechanisms of culture.

Wilsonholds the Thompson Chair of Environmental Studies at Gettysburg College.Essential reading for those interested in how Americans value nature and how they use their collectively owned lands. (<i>Forest History Today</i>)<br><br>America&#x2019;s Public Lands is a wonderful introductory book for those interested in federal land management practice and law. It contains enough detailed analysis of contemporary issues to engage those familiar with the subject while it is broad enough to give nascent readers to the field a fine single volume that encapsulates much of what has been argued on the subject over the last several decades.The book&#x2019;s most interesting premise is that public lands need to be addressed as one system and not a collection of fiefdoms divided by bureaucratic borders. Wilson&#x2019;s unifying concept is being advocated at the highest levels in Washington, D.C., and it was voiced by Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack in his first policy speech on the national forests in Seattle in 2009. (<i>The American Historian</i>)<br><br>Effective. . . . Admirable. . . . By placing these public lands institutions in tension with one another, Wilson does something more than provide an up-to-date history and mission analysis of the agencies that oversee public lands; America&#x2019;s Public Lands, perhaps for the first time, combines these histories and contemporary contestations in a single text, situating each of the institutions within a larger ideology, discourse, and practice of conservation and intentional management. . . . Wilson envelops these conceptualizations into lived realities and practices, ultimately demonstrating how ideas turn into institutions that are dynamic, but also deeply rooted in their pasts. . . . The first text in nearly two decades . . . to treat the public land system as a coherent whole, part of a larger ideological and managerial project. In this regard, the text has no contemporaries, as it provides a single academic resource that revels in these lands&#x2019; existence, but does so in a way that does not avoid the paradoxes, incongruities, struggles, and inequalities that help formulate their contemporary management. . . . Wilson&#x2019;s book offers readers a chance to reconsider our complex, multifaceted, and often ironic relationships with public lands in the United States. . . . Appropriate for a wide variety of academic and popular audiences. While scholars will find usefulness in having the text as an up-to-date reference point, it will provide a substantial contribution to undergraduate and postgraduate courses as well. Widely diverse courses in public land management, environmental planning, environmental policy, environmental politics, environmental history, environmental law, environmental social studies, wilderness, and the environmental humanities will find this text to be valuable. Wilson&#x2019;s book neatly and creatively packs a great deal of information and analyses into just over 300 pages. (<i>Society &amp; Natural Resources</i>)<br><br>Randall Wilson&#x2019;s America&#x2019;s Public Lands provides a useful introduction to the history and politics of the vast array of federal land programs. . . .Wilson has fashioned a readable, well-informed volume that builds on existing scholarship (including his own research on collaborative management) to construct a framework for understanding the essentially contested nature of our public lands as the setting for both resource exploitation and natural preservation. . . .The book is well designed as an introductory text for courses on federal land policy or western environmental history. It offers a clear and inviting narrative, an extensive bibliography to guide student research, and a sophisticated analytical blend of institutional politics and cultural change. . . .Wilson&#x2019;s comprehensive view offers much to engage experts as well, showing the political and ideological underpinnings of land issues that span all these agencies. (<i>Environmental History</i>)<br><br>America's Public Lands: From Yellowstone to Smokey Bear and Beyond considers how it's come to be that a nation that cherishes the ideal of private property has methodically set aside nearly a third of its territory as public lands, and provides a history of the making of America's public land system. Chapters do more than chart the usual evolution of parklands and policies: they consider the origins of the idea of public domain and access, considering forces towards privatization and conservation and how they interacted to produce the parklands system we have today. Chapters cover national parks and forests, wildlife refuges, and wilderness areas and provide discussions surrounding policy debates and establishment processes for many of country's top wildlife areas, making this a far more wide-ranging survey than the usual parklands history approach, and a highly recommended pick for any who would understand the bigger picture involved in parklands creation, history, and management. (<i>Midwest Book Review</i>)<br><br>Wilson offers a well-written, thoughtful, and ambitious synthesis of the story of America&#x2019;s public lands that (literally!) covers a great deal of ground clearly and concisely. In addition to providing a historical narrative of how the nation&#x2019;s public lands system came together, Wilson contextualizes the story more broadly, seeing how the various components of the system (the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, etc.) reflect different notions of nature and economic development. He also offers a framework for examining current issues that involve public land policies and uses. Wilson&#x2019;s personal enthusiasm for America&#x2019;s public lands runs clearly throughout the book and his hope is that this overview will add to greater public and scholarly awareness of the system and the settings it protects. . . .The book should be required reading for North American historical geographers, historians of the American West and public lands, employees in a wide assortment of public agencies, and for anyone interested in why one-third of the United States looks the way it does. (<i>Journal of Historical Geography</i>)<br><br>Wilson provides a complete history, from colonial times, of what it took to build the national commons....

America&#x2019;s Public Lands is clear and concise, and gives a thorough but succinct overview of the public lands system..... Winner of the 2014 John Brinkerhoff Jackson Prize by the American Association of Geographers, the book wonderfully displays the successes, failures, and controversies surrounding the park system and other public lands. It is a gift to the historical geographical community as the National Park Service enters its second century. It gives an insightful overview of historic viewpoints toward nature that allows readers to question the way they see public lands and the way they value these areas in the twenty-first century.

Is it a sign of strength or of weakness that the US has suddenly shifted from a politics of consensus to one of coercion on the world stage? What was really at stake in the war on Iraq? Was it all about oil and, if not, what else was involved? What role has a sagging economy played in pushing the US into foreign adventurism? What exactly is the relationship between US militarism abroad and domestic politics? These are the questions taken up in this compelling and original book. In this closely argued and clearly written book, David Harvey, one of the leading social theorists of his generation, builds a conceptual framework to expose the underlying forces at work behind these momentous shifts in US policies and politics. The compulsions behind the projection of US power on the world as a "new imperialism" are here, for the first time, laid bare for all to see.<br></p><p>David Harvey is a Distinguished Professor, Ph.D Program in Anthropology, City University of New York.<br>"A high accessible and thought-provoking book." --<em>The Professional Geographer</em><p></p><br>"He makes an important theoretical contribution to understanding contemporary empire's vicissitudes'."--<em>The Times Higher Education Supplement</em><p></p><br>"<em>The New Imperialism</em> merits the widest possible public.

While credit for its genius has traditionally been attributed solely to its director, Orson Welles, Carringer's pioneering study documents the shared creative achievements of Welles and his principal collaborators. <i>The Making of Citizen Kane</i>, copiously illustrated with rare photographs and production documents, also provides an in-depth view of the operations of the Hollywood studio system. This new edition includes a revised preface and overview of criticism, an updated chronology of the film's reception history, a reconsideration of the locus of responsibility of Welles's ill-fated <i>The Magnificent Ambersons</i>, and new photographs.</p><p>Ever since Pauline Kael wrote her controversial essay "Raising Kane" (available in print in her omnibus collection <i>For Keeps</i>), film fans and scholars have debated the "authorship" of <i>Citizen Kane</i>. Most audiences and critics agree that it is one of the greatest American movies, but Kael claimed that the genius behind <i>Kane</i> was not writer-director-producer-actor Orson Welles, but coscenarist Herman Mankiewicz. Others attribute the film's power to the influence and contributions of John Houseman or the incredible innovations of cinematographer Gregg Toland. In this superbly researched book, Robert Carringer proves conclusively that <i>Kane</i> is not the product of any individual artist, but the collective work of a brilliant team working under Welles's supervision. Without Mankiewicz, Toland, and the talented designers and technicians who worked on the film, <i>Kane</i> could never have become what it is. As Carringer covers each step of the film's production, from conception to final release, he leads readers through the enormously complex process of making a great movie. He also provides an introductory chapter about an unfilmed project Welles worked on before <i>Kane</i>, an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's <i>Heart of Darkness</i>. In his concluding chapter on <i>The Magnificent Ambersons</i>, Welles's follow-up to <i>Kane</i>, Carringer argues that the latter film suffered precisely because its collaborators failed to achieve the artistic harmony that had made <i>Kane</i> so successful. <i>--Raphael Shargel</i><b>Robert L.

She lives in Los Angeles with her husband, their daughter, and their dog.The Groupie<br><br>Daisy<br><br>Jones<br><br>1965&#x2013;�1972<br><br>Daisy Jones was born in 1951 and grew up in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles, California. The daughter of Frank Jones, the well-�known British painter, and Jeanne LeFevre, a French model, Daisy started to make a name for herself in the late sixties as a young teenager on the Sunset Strip.<br><br>Elaine Chang (biographer, author of Daisy Jones: Wild Flower): Here is what is so captivating about Daisy Jones even before she was &#x201c;Daisy Jones.&#x201d;<br><br>You&#x2019;ve got a rich white girl, growing up in L.A. She&#x2019;s gorgeous&#x2014;�even as a child. She has these stunning big blue eyes&#x2014;�dark, cobalt blue. One of my favorite anecdotes about her is that in the eighties a colored-�contact company actually created a shade called Daisy Blue. She&#x2019;s got copper-�red hair that is thick and wavy and&nbsp;. . . takes up so much space. And then her cheekbones almost seem swollen, that&#x2019;s how defined they are. And she&#x2019;s got an incredible voice that she doesn&#x2019;t cultivate, never takes a lesson. She&#x2019;s born with all the money in the world, access to whatever she wants&#x2014;�artists, drugs, clubs&#x2014;�anything and everything at her disposal.<br><br>But she has no one. No siblings, no extended family in Los Angeles. Two parents who are so into their own world that they are all but indifferent to her existence. Although, they never shy away from making her pose for their artist friends. That&#x2019;s why there are so many paintings and photos of Daisy as a child&#x2014;�the artists that came into that home saw Daisy Jones, saw how gorgeous she was, and wanted to capture her. It&#x2019;s telling that there is no Frank Jones piece of Daisy. Her father is too busy with his male nudes to pay much attention to his daughter. And in general, Daisy spends her childhood rather alone.<br><br>But she&#x2019;s actually a very gregarious, outgoing kid&#x2014;�Daisy would often ask to get her hair cut just because she loved her hairdresser, she would ask neighbors if she could walk their dogs, there was even a family joke about the time Daisy tried to bake a birthday cake for the mailman. So this is a girl that desperately wants to connect. But there&#x2019;s no one in her life who is truly interested in who she is, especially not her parents. And it really breaks her. But it is also how she grows up to become an icon.<br><br>We love broken, beautiful people. And it doesn&#x2019;t get much more obviously broken and more classically beautiful than Daisy Jones.<br><br>So it makes sense that Daisy starts to find herself on the Sunset Strip. This glamorous, seedy place.<br><br>Daisy Jones (singer, Daisy Jones &amp; The Six): I could walk down to the Strip from my house. I was about fourteen, sick of being stuck in the house, just looking for something to do. I wasn&#x2019;t old enough to get into any of the bars and clubs but I went anyway.<br><br>I remember bumming a cigarette off of a roadie for the Byrds when I was pretty young. I learned quickly that people thought you were older if you didn&#x2019;t wear your bra. And sometimes I&#x2019;d wear a bandanna headband like the cool girls had on. I wanted to fit in with the groupies on the sidewalk, with their joints and their flasks and all of that.<br><br>So I bummed a cigarette from this roadie outside the Whisky a Go Go one night&#x2014;�the first time I&#x2019;d ever had one and I tried to pretend I did it all the time. I held the cough in my throat and what have you&#x2014;�and I was flirting with him the best I could. I&#x2019;m embarrassed to think about it now, how clumsy I probably was.<br><br>But eventually, some guy comes up to the roadie and says, &#x201c;We gotta get inside and set up the amps.&#x201d; And he turns to me and says, &#x201c;You coming?&#x201d; And that&#x2019;s how I snuck into the Whisky for the first time.<br><br>I stayed out that night until three or four in the morning. I&#x2019;d never done anything like that before. But suddenly it was like I existed. I was a part of something. I went from zero to sixty that night. I was drinking and smoking anything anybody would give me.<br><br>When I got home, I walked in through the front door, drunk and stoned, and crashed in my bed. I&#x2019;m pretty sure my parents never even noticed I was gone.<br><br>I got up, went out the next night, did the same thing.<br><br>Eventually, the bouncers on the Strip recognized me and let me in wherever I was going. The Whisky, London Fog, the Riot House. No one cared how young I was.<br><br>Greg McGuinness (former concierge, the Continental Hyatt House): Ah, man, I don&#x2019;t know how long Daisy was hanging around the Hyatt House before I noticed her. But I remember the first time I saw her. I was on the phone and in walks this crazy tall, crazy skinny girl with these bangs. And the biggest, roundest blue eyes you ever saw in your life, man. She also had this smile. Huge smile. She came in on the arm of some guy. I don&#x2019;t remember who.<br><br>A lot of the girls around the Strip back then, I mean, they were young, but they tried to seem older. Daisy just was, though. Didn&#x2019;t seem like she was trying to be anything. Except herself.<br><br>After that, I noticed she was at the hotel a lot. She was always laughing. There was nothing jaded about her, &#x2019;least when I knew her. It was like watching Bambi learn how to walk. She was real na�ve and real vulnerable but you could tell there was something about her.<br><br>I was nervous for her, tell you the truth. There were so many men in the scene that were&nbsp;. . . into young girls. Thirty-�something rock stars sleeping with teenagers. Not saying it was okay, just saying that&#x2019;s how it was. How old was Lori Mattix when she was with Jimmy Page? Fourteen? And Iggy Pop and Sable Starr? He sang about it, man. He was bragging about it.<br><br>When it came to Daisy&#x2014;�I mean, the singers, the guitarists, the roadies&#x2014;�everybody was looking at her. Whenever I saw her, though, I&#x2019;d try to make sure she was doing all right. I kept tabs on her here and there. I really liked her. She was just cooler than anything else happening around her.<br><br>Daisy: I learned about sex and love the hard way. That men will take what they want and feel no debt, that some people only want one piece of you.<br><br>I do think there were girls&#x2014;�the Plaster Casters, some of the GTOs&#x2014;�maybe they weren&#x2019;t being taken advantage of, I don&#x2019;t know. But it was a bad scene for me, at first.<br><br>I lost my virginity to somebody that&nbsp;. . . it doesn&#x2019;t matter who it was. He was older, he was a drummer. We were in the lobby of the Riot House and he invited me upstairs to do some lines. He said I was the girl of his dreams.<br><br>I was drawn to him mainly because he was drawn to me. I wanted someone to single me out as something special. I was just so desperate to hold someone&#x2019;s interest.<br><br>Before I knew it, we were on his bed. And he asked me if I knew what I was doing and I said yes even though the answer was no. But everyone always talked about free love and how sex was a good thing. If you were cool, if you were hip, you liked sex.<br><br>I stared at the ceiling the whole time, waiting for him to be done. I knew I was supposed to be moving around but I stayed perfectly still, scared to move. All you could hear in the room was the sound of our clothes rubbing up against the bedspread.<br><br>I had no idea what I was doing or why I was doing things I knew I didn&#x2019;t want to be doing. But I&#x2019;ve had a lot of therapy in my life now. And I mean a lot of therapy. And I see it now. I see myself clearly now. I wanted to be around these men&#x2014;�these stars&#x2014;�because I didn&#x2019;t know how else to be important. And I figured I had to please them if I wanted to stay.<br><br>When he was done, he got up. And I pulled my dress down. And he said, &#x201c;If you want to go back down to your friends, that&#x2019;s all right.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t really have any friends. But I knew he meant I needed to leave. So I did.<br><br>He never talked to me again.<br><br>Simone Jackson (disco star): I remember seeing Daisy on the dance floor one night at the Whisky. Everybody saw her. Your eye went right to her. If the rest of the world was silver, Daisy was gold.<br><br>Daisy: Simone became my best friend.<br><br>Simone: I brought Daisy out with me everywhere. I never had a sister.<br><br>I remember&nbsp;. . . It was the Sunset Strip riot, when all of us went down to Pandora&#x2019;s and protested the curfew and the cops. Daisy and I went out, protested, met up with some actors and went over to Barney&#x2019;s Beanery to keep partying. After that, we went back to somebody&#x2019;s place. Daisy passed out on this guy&#x2019;s patio. We didn&#x2019;t go home until the next afternoon. She was maybe fifteen. I was probably nineteen. I just kept thinking, Doesn&#x2019;t anybody care about this girl but me?<br><br>And, by the way, we were all on speed back then, even Daisy as young as she was. But if you wanted to stay skinny and be up all night, you were taking something. Mostly bennies or black beauties.<br><br>Daisy: Diet pills were an easy choice. It didn&#x2019;t even feel like a choice. It didn&#x2019;t even feel like we were getting high, at first. Coke, too. If it was around, you took a bump. People didn&#x2019;t even consider it an addiction. It wasn&#x2019;t like that.<br><br>Simone: My producer bought me a place in Laurel Canyon. He wanted to sleep with me. I told him no and he bought it for me anyway. I had Daisy move in.<br><br>We ended up sharing a bed for six months. So I can tell you firsthand that that girl never slept. I&#x2019;d be trying to fall asleep at four in the morning and Daisy would want the light on so she could read.<br><br>Daisy: I had pretty bad insomnia for a long time, even when I was a kid. I&#x2019;d be up at eleven o&#x2019;clock, saying I wasn&#x2019;t tired, and my parents would always yell at me to &#x201c;just go to sleep.&#x201d; So in the middle of the night I was always looking for quiet things to do. My mom had these romance novels hanging around so I would read those. It would be two in the morning and my parents would be having a party downstairs and I&#x2019;d be sitting on my bed with my lamp on, reading Doctor Zhivago or Peyton Place.<br><br>And then it just became habit. I would read anything that was around. I wasn&#x2019;t picky. Thrillers, detective novels, sci-�fi.<br><br>Around the time I moved in with Simone, I found a box of history biographies on the side of the road one day, up in Beachwood Canyon. I tore through those in no time.<br><br>Simone: I&#x2019;ll tell you, she&#x2019;s the entire reason I started wearing a sleeping mask. [Laughs] But then I kept doing it because I looked chic.<br><br>Daisy: I was living with Simone for two weeks before I went home to get more clothes.<br><br>My dad said, &#x201c;Did you break the coffeemaker this morning?&#x201d;<br><br>I said, &#x201c;Dad, I don&#x2019;t even live here.&#x201d;<br><br>Simone: I told her the one condition of living with me was that she had to go to school.<br><br>Daisy: High school was not easy for me. I knew that to get an A, you had to do what you were told. But I also knew that a lot of what we were being told was bullshit. I remember one time I was assigned an essay on how Columbus discovered America and so I wrote a paper about how Columbus did not discover America. Because he didn&#x2019;t. But then I got an F.<br><br>I said to my teacher, &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m right.&#x201d;<br><br>And she said, &#x201c;But you didn&#x2019;t follow the assignment.&#x201d;<br><br>Simone: She was so bright and her teachers didn&#x2019;t seem to really recognize that.<br><br>Daisy: People always say I didn&#x2019;t graduate high school but I did. When I walked across the stage to get my diploma, Simone was cheering for me. She was so proud of me. And I started to feel proud of myself, too. That night, I took the diploma out of its case and I folded it up and I used it, like a bookmark, in my copy of Valley of the Dolls.<br><br>Simone: When my first album flopped, my record label dropped me. My producer kicked us out of that place. I got a job waiting tables and moved in with my cousin in Leimert Park. Daisy had to move back in with her parents.<br><br>Daisy: I just packed up my stuff from Simone&#x2019;s and drove it right back to my parents&#x2019; place. When I walked in the front door, my mom was on the phone, smoking a cigarette.<br><br>I said, &#x201c;Hey, I&#x2019;m back.&#x201d;<br><br>She said, &#x201c;We got a new couch,&#x201d; and then just kept on talking on the phone.<br><br>Simone: Daisy got all of her beauty from her mother. Jeanne was gorgeous. I remember I met her a few times back then. Big eyes, very full lips. There was a sensuality to her. People used to always tell Daisy she looked just like her mother. They did look similar but I knew better than to tell Daisy that.<br><br>I think one time I said to Daisy, &#x201c;Your mom is beautiful.&#x201d;<br><br>Daisy said to me, &#x201c;Yeah, beautiful and nothing else.&#x201d;</p><h2>Dogzilla</h2><p>&#x201c;Dogzilla rises from a volcano to break up the First Annual Mousopolis Barbecue Cook-Off, and scatter the Big Cheese&#x2019;s troops with her fearsome doggy breath--but the threat of a bath sends her scurrying back to her mountain.

For several years prior to my tour of Palestine in 1902, I had noted with interest the accounts, in books on biblical antiquities, of the Holy Scroll at Nablus. This manuscript, containing the Pentateuch, is believed to be the oldest manuscript in existence of any portion of the Bible. As the priests show it with great reluctance, and are supposed to exhibit it, even to their own people, only once a year, on the Day of Atonement, I was anxious that they should not substitute for it, at the time of my visit, the more recent parchment which on ordinary occasions they display. My friend, Mr. E. K. Warren, chairman of the World&#39;s Sunday-school Convention Committee of Arrangements, had visited Palestine the year before, and had seen the ancient scroll. He gave me a letter of introduction to the High Priest, written on his business letter-head, which rather formidable-looking document I found of service on --- my arrival in Nablus....</p><p></p><h2>Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives</h2><p><b>Celebrated scientists Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler explain the amazing power of social networks and our profound influence on one another's lives.</b><br>Your colleague's husband's sister can make you fat, even if you don't know her. A happy neighbor has more impact on your happiness than a happy spouse. These startling revelations of how much we truly influence one another are revealed in the studies of Drs. Christakis and Fowler, which have repeatedly made front-page news nationwide. <br><br>In CONNECTED, the authors explain why emotions are contagious, how health behaviors spread, why the rich get richer, even how we find and choose our partners. Intriguing and entertaining, CONNECTED overturns the notion of the individual and provides a revolutionary paradigm-that social networks influence our ideas, emotions, health, relationships, behavior, politics, and much more. It will change the way we think about every aspect of our lives.<br></p><p>Nicholas A. Christakis, MD, PhD, is a professor at Harvard University with joint appointments in the Departments of Health Care Policy, Sociology, and Medicine, and in 2009 was named one of <i>Time</i> magazine's 100 most influential people in the world. James H. Fowler, PhD, is an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, in the Department of Political Science and The Center for Wireless and Population Health Systems, and was named one of the "most inspiring scientists" by the San Diego Science Festival. Christakis and Fowler's research has appeared on <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show, Good Morning America, Today, </i>and <i>The Colbert Report</i>, and on the front pages of the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Washington Post,</i> and <i>USA Today</i>.<b></b>The authors examine the importance of human connections and the influence of people&#39;s networks on how things happen in their lives. This interesting compilation of research covers topics such as how networks can help people solve problems and how many people need to be stopped and looking up on a sidewalk before an uninvolved passerby will do likewise. Nicholas Christakis brings a slightly academic tone to his narration, giving a bit of gravitas to what some may consider to be simple common sense: Happiness spreads through networks; happy people attract other happy people. While Christakis&#39;s delivery could benefit from more variation in tone, his steady pace makes this lengthy volume engaging. M.R. � AudioFile 2010, Portland, Maine</p><h2>To Hell and Back : An Autobiography of &#39;Meat Loaf</h2><p>Meat Loaf&#39;s bizarre and spectacular life story is scarcely credible. After surviving an abusive childhood, during which he was almost murdered by his alcoholic father, he starred in one of the biggest stage and film musicals ever, then went on to record the third best-selling album of all time. To Hell and Back is the story of a man who ran away from a cruel home life at 17 and starred in the legendary Rocky Horror Picture Show before turning to rock-&#39;n&#39;roll. His first album, Bat Out Of Hell, was considered so uncommercial by his first record label that they dropped him - only for it to go on to sell 20 million copies worldwide. He then spent the Eighties on the skids, with a severe drink and drugs problem and mounting money problems leading him to a nervous breakdown, before making a triumphant comeback with 1993&#39;s album Bat Out Of Hell II and colossal hit single &#39;I&#39;d Do Anything For Love&#39;. This is an extraordinary story and a classic rock autobiography.</p><p>Who'd have guessed that the man credited with bringing rock &amp; roll to a whole new level of garishness would pen such a vastly entertaining, funny, touching, and plainspoken autobiography? But Meat Loaf (christened Marvin Lee Aday) and coauthor David Dalton succeed by skillfully modifying the tongue-in-cheek hyperbole and the bombastic befuddlement of the man's Wagner-crossed-with-the-Shangri-Las music to fit the printed page. Meat Loaf grew up in Dallas, Texas, the son of a schoolteacher (she penned a locally popular textbook on Communism) and an alcoholic cop (who happened to be an acquaintance of Jack Ruby). Meat--he earned the nickname early on--got in touch with his theatrical side as a teen and was soon off on his haphazard way, stumbling from misadventure to misadventure, and taking more than his fair share of knocks along the way. (Literally--he's suffered 17 concussions thus far, which provide an oddly effective narrative device.) He lurched into the middle of the JFK assassination scene, picked up a hitchhiking Charlie Manson, earned a part in <i>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</i>, and recorded one of the most successful albums of the '70s, <i>Bat out of Hell</i>. His ample fame inevitably tied to his ample frame, Meat Loaf quickly became something of an amped-up Fatty Arbuckle. Then came the colossal excesses and flop follow-ups, capped by a rebound called--you guessed it--<i>Bat out of Hell II: Back into Hell</i>. Yes, it's a familiar framework, but the telling of Meat Loaf's rise, fall, and recovery is never anything less than fresh and absorbing. <i>--Steven Stolder</i>Meat Loaf has co-written his autobiography with David Dalton, who has previously written much-acclaimed biographies of Marianne Faithful, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison and Sid Vicious.</p><h2>Stumpwork Embroidery Designs and Projects (Milner Craft)</h2><p>Stumpwork&#x2014;or raised embroidery&#x2014;has a rich texture that really makes a design stand out.

No one in town will let him forget that he's a minister's son, even if he doesn't act like one. But then he meets Lizzie Bright Griffin, a smart and sassy girl from a poor nearby island community founded by former slaves. Despite his father's-and the town's-disapproval of their friendship, Turner spends time with Lizzie, and it opens up a whole new world to him, filled with the mystery and wonder of Maine's rocky coast. The two soon discover that the town elders, along with Turner's father, want to force the people to leave Lizzie's island so that Phippsburg can start a lucrative tourist trade there. Turner gets caught up in a spiral of disasters that alter his life-but also lead him to new levels of acceptance and maturity. This sensitively written historical novel, based on the true story of a community's destruction, highlights a unique friendship during a time of change. Author's note.<br></p><p><b>Gary D. Schmidt</b> is the best-selling author of <i>Pay Attention, Carter Jones;&nbsp;</i><i>Orbiting Jupiter;&nbsp;</i>the Newbery Honor and Printz Honor book <i>Lizzie Bright and the Buckminster Boy;</i>&nbsp;the Newbery Honor book <i>The Wednesday Wars;&nbsp;</i>and <i>Okay for Now</i>. He&nbsp;is a professor of English at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan.Boston and Phippsburg are close geographically, but 13-year-old Tucker Buckminster, who moves to Maine with his minister father, discovers they are two different worlds. He tries to fit in but the door is firmly shut until he finds friendship with old Mrs. Heard and sprightly Lizzie Bright. From the beginning, Sam Freed portrays Tucker as open, caring, and honest as he faces his new life. Freed doesn't differentiate the many characters, but his Maine accent is superb. Freed superbly conveys Tucker's innocence and na�vet� as he faces prejudice, his wonder and awe at communing with the whales, and finally his growing strength of character and sense of self.

Yes, style is definitely not fashion, and, in each case, the transformation is amazing.

Somewhere in a mansion on Biscayne Bay there rests a thousand pounds of cartel gold that Pablo Escobar, now dead, will never retrieve. Hans-Peter Schneider&#x2014;the new face in our nightmares from the man who gave us Hannibal Lecter&#x2014;has plans to steal the gold but he&#x2019;s not the only one looking for it. Cari Mora is the young caretaker of the Escobar mansion, and Hans-Peter has plans for her too; plans that involve his primary occupation as a flesh peddler of the most disturbing sort, catering to the fantasies of an incredibly wealthy clientele. Hans-Peter&#x2019;s macabre interests and inventions are pure Thomas Harris--and Cari Mora, a woman who has already survived unspeakable things, is a worthy opponent for Hans-Peter in this complex cat-and-mouse thriller. <em>Cari Mora</em> is as cinematic as one might expect (and hope for), charged with smugglers and lawmen, gruesome deaths, and deceit that crisscrosses the ocean between Colombia and Miami. Just when you think you know what&#x2019;s coming, Harris has another twist up his sleeve.

Morrison Series in Southern Studies)</h2><p>The Hatfield-McCoy feud, the entertaining subject of comic strips, popular songs, movies, and television, has long been a part of American folklore and legend. Ironically, the extraordinary endurance of the myth that has grown up around the Hatfields and McCoys has obscured the consideration of the feud as a serious historical event. In this study, Altina Waller tells the real story of the Hatfields and McCoys and the Tug Valley of West Virginia and Kentucky, placing the feud in the context of community and regional change in the era of industrialization.<br><br>Waller argues that the legendary feud was not an outgrowth of an inherently violent mountain culture but rather one manifestation of a contest for social and economic control between local people and outside industrial capitalists -- the Hatfields were defending community autonomy while the McCoys were allied with the forces of industrial capitalism. Profiling the colorful feudists "Devil Anse" Hatfield, "Old Ranel" McCoy, "Bad" Frank Phillips, and the ill-fated lovers Roseanna McCoy and Johnse Hatfield, Waller illustrates how Appalachians both shaped and responded to the new economic and social order.<br><br></p><p>"While Waller's study is invaluable for Americanists, she has written an engaging work that, quite simply, is an enjoyable read."-- <i>Publishers Weekly</i> <br>Providing more than a narration of the events, Altina Waller tells the real story of the Hatfields and the McCoys instead of perpetuating the myths surrounding them.</p><h2>Rocky Road: A Culinary Mystery (Culinary Mysteries)</h2><p>THE ST.

He is presumed to be deceased. It was supposed to be a girls&#39; weekend in scenic St. George, Utah, that would include shopping, trying out the local cuisine, and participating in a breast cancer fund-raiser. The fact that one of the organizers of the fund-raising event, a local doctor, had disappeared two months before was not supposed to be Sadie&#39;s problem.

The Remedy</h2><p>This classic work is an enquiry into the cause of industrial depressions and the persistence of poverty amid advancing wealth. Published in 1879, it was admired and advocated by great minds such as Albert Einstein, Winston Churchill, Leo Tolstoy and Sun Yat-sen in China. Henry George lived through a period of American history which witnessed the closing of the frontier, and he noticed the dramatic deterioration in the condition of labour once that happened. While land was freely available wages were high, once it was enclosed wages fell. Adam Smith appears not to have appreciated the full consequences of this, but he was writing before their full horror became evident in the form of landless peasants crowding into city slums, seeking work in &#34;satanic mills&#34; at minimum wages. Henry George, observing similar events in America (he was a journalist), saw the connection between land enclosure and poverty and unemployment. He also realized that the harmful effects could be rectified, without confiscating the land, through a change in the tax system and allowing market forces to work. This classic offers an alternative ethical and practical guide at a time when the collapse of the Marxist/Socialist experiment and the deep recession in the West leave many seeking fresh inspiration.</p><p>In this volume three very different aspects of the late nineteenth-century debate on poverty are bound together: the American Henry George&#39;s Progress and Poverty, a response by a British businessman, Isaac B. Cooke, and a description by Andrew Mearns of the reality of poverty in the world&#39;s richest city.HENRY GEORGE (1839-1897) was a noted American economist and founder of the single-tax movement. He first outlined the doctrine in the pamphlet Our Land and Land Policy in 1871 and later wrote the more elaborate treatise Progress and Poverty (1879), which sold millions of copies all over the world.</p><h2>Beneath the United States: A History of U.S. Policy toward Latin America</h2><p><p>In this sweeping history of United States policy toward Latin America, Lars Schoultz shows that the United States has always perceived Latin America as a fundamentally inferior neighbor, unable to manage its affairs and stubbornly underdeveloped.</p><p>This perception of inferiority was apparent from the beginning. John Quincy Adams, who first established diplomatic relations with Latin America, believed that Hispanics were "lazy, dirty, nasty...a parcel of hogs." In the early nineteenth century, ex-President John Adams declared that any effort to implant democracy in Latin America was "as absurd as similar plans would be to establish democracies among the birds, beasts, and fishes."</p><p>Drawing on extraordinarily rich archival sources, Schoultz, one of the country's foremost Latin America scholars, shows how these core beliefs have not changed for two centuries. We have combined self-interest with a "civilizing mission"--a self-abnegating effort by a superior people to help a substandard civilization overcome its defects. William Howard Taft felt the way to accomplish this task was "to knock their heads together until they should maintain peace," while in 1959 CIA Director Allen Dulles warned that "the new Cuban officials had to be treated more or less like children." Schoultz shows that the policies pursued reflected these deeply held convictions.</p><p>While political correctness censors the expression of such sentiments today, the actions of the United States continue to assume the political and cultural inferiority of Latin America. Schoultz demonstrates that not until the United States perceives its southern neighbors as equals can it anticipate a constructive hemispheric alliance.</p></p><p>Lars Schoultz is William Rand Kenan, Jr., Professor Emeritus of Political Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He is the author of five books on U.S. policy toward Latin America. Schoultz has been President of the Latin American Studies Association and has held research fellowships from the Ford Foundation, Fulbright-Hays Program, MacArthur Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, Social Science Research Council, Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, and National Humanities Center.&#x201c;This excellent study breaks new ground in a field so cluttered that one usually harbours very low expectations of originality, style and fresh scholarship. Schoultz, a political scientist hitherto best known for his study of human rights, has written a lucid history that derives much of its strength precisely from its understanding of the conservative and expansionist presumptions of those who have formulated and implemented US policy towards the rest of the continent since independence. This, though, is not an understanding assumed with the ease that one generally finds in texts on this topic; here it is based on meticulous research of primary documentation...Schoultz's knowledge of the sources comes through in the excellent use of quotation within a briskly written and delightfully jargon-free prose.

While time and circumstance affect the exact mix of reasons behind the overall policy, these three interests are permanent.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>George Victers</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This excellent study breaks new ground in a field so cluttered that one usually harbours very low expectations of originality, style and fresh scholarship. Schoultz, a political scientist hitherto best known for his study of human rights, has written a lucid history that derives much of its strength precisely from its understanding of the conservative and expansionist presumptions of those who have formulated and implemented US policy towards the rest of the continent since independence. This, though, is not an understanding assumed with the ease that one generally finds in texts on this topic; here it is based on meticulous research of primary documentation...Schoultz's knowledge of the sources comes through in the excellent use of quotation within a briskly written and delightfully jargon-free prose...Of the plethora of single-volume studies of this vital subject Lars Schoultz's is easily the best.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>James Dunkerly</b><b>, </b><b><i>International Affairs</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[<i>Beneath the United States</i>] is a thorough and comprehensive guide to US/Latin American relations and the sometimes tedious US policies involved. Schoultz writes clearly and in depth with fresh insight and provocative views. Above all the book demonstrates the US attitude of superiority towards Latin American both overt and covert, and how this attitude must change if a constructive hemispheric alliance is ever to be achieved. Amazingly extensive research digging deep into the rich archival sources available is apparent throughout the book and this is what will most probably make it the standard one-volume work in the field.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>British Bulletin</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Beneath the United States</i> is a rich historical examination of US foreign policy toward Latin America from the early 1800s to 1996...The volume stands apart from other works in the field in that the unifying theme throughout is the well-documented argument that US policy makers consistently have treated their southern neighbors as inferiors. Of course, Schoultz also includes the more standard explanation for US behavior--national interest based on security, domestic, and economic issues--but it is the abundance of quotations by US officials, and even a few presidents, referring to Latin Americans in a condescending manner that really drives home the point...The historical narrative style makes this volume eminently readable. It is replete with fascinating details that are often overlooked, such as the opportunity to annex the Dominican Republic in 1869. Recommended for all college and university collections.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>L.

Schoultz's work integrates the most popular interpretations of US policy and gives them order and coherence by arguing that US hegemony, implemented in a variety of styles, was ultimately shaped by the belief of Latin American cultural inferiority...It is a book about misperceptions, narrow definitions and ethnocentrism that accurately depicts training and sensitivity deficits about Latin America in the minds of most US policy-makers...Schoultz's work is essential reading for students of US foreign policy and US-Latin American relations for it provides a powerful and barely used argument about the (recurring) failure of US policy towards its southern neighbours. <i>Beneath the United States</i> contributes to the advancement of knowledge by making it clear that the literature about US policy towards Latin America still has many hypotheses to prove.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ana Covarrubias</b><b>, </b><b><i>Latin American Studies</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A splendid and important book--exhaustively researched, cogently and eloquently written, at once passionate and thoughtful...Schoultz's approach works both as intellectual history and as diplomatic history.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John Coatsworth, Harvard University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Superb work.

Helping your children develop values such as honesty, self-reliance, and dependability is as important a part of their education as teaching them to read or how to cross the street safely. The values you teach your children are their best protection from the influences of peer pressure and the temptations of consumer culture. With their own values clearly defined, your children can make their own decisions -- rather than imitate their friends or the latest fashions. In <i>Teaching Your Children Values</i> Linda and Richard Eyre present a practical, proven, month-by-month program of games, family ctivities, and value-building ecercises for kids of all ages.</p><p>Richard Eyre is the author or coauthor of sixteen books. He and his wife head the international parents cooperative organisation, S.J.S. Homebase.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b>Month 1:</b><br><br><b>Honesty</b><br><br><i>Honesty with other individuals, with institutions, with society, with self. The inner strength and confidence that is bred by exacting truthfulness, trustworthiness, and integrity.</i><br><br>Pulling into the driveway one day, I noticed a broken milk bottle on the pavement. I asked nine-year-old Josh and his friend, Chip, if they knew how it happened. Chip quickly said no. Josh looked over at him, somewhat startled, then walked over and put his hand on Chip's shoulder and said, "It's okay, he'll understand." Then to me, "The basketball hit it, Dad. Sorry. We were going to dean it up, bat we forgot. Come on, Chip, I'll get the dustpan."<br><br>I listened through the window as they were sweeping up. "One thing I've learned," Josh was counseling Chip, a full six months his junior, "is that you get in a lot less trouble when you just go ahead and tell the truth." -- <b>Richard</b><br><br><b>TEACHING YOUR CHILDREN VALUES</b><br><br>Teaching children honesty can be a real challenge, given the examples of dishonesty that they will encounter every day in the world around them. Your example, and your constant feedback about your child's behavior, can be a powerful influence on your child. Along with your example, we have discovered some other teaching methods that work. These methods are presented (as they are in each chapter) in four brief sections. First, general guidelines for children of all ages; then methods aimed at preschoolers, elementary-age children, and adolescents.<br><br><b>GENERAL GUIDELINES</b><br><br><i>Be completely honest with your children.</i> This will show them how always applicable the principle is and will demonstrate your commitment to it. Answer their questions truthfully and candidly unless it is a question that is off-limits, and then tell them simply and honestly why you won't answer it. Never let them hear you tell little "convenient lies" on the phone and never ask them to tell one for you ("My mommy isn't home"). Don't exaggerate. Don't threaten to do things you don't really intend to do.<br><br><i>Give praise and the chance to "start over."</i> This gives children a quick second chance to be truthful. Don't be anxious to "catch" your children in a lie. Instead "catch them telling the truth" and praise them for it. If they do tell (or begin to tell) what you think is an untruth, interrupt and say, "Wait, think for a minute. Remember that it's important to tell the truth." Then let them start over.<br><br><i>Point out consequences.</i> Show your children the cause-and-effect dynamics of honesty and dishonesty. Watch for situations (in real life, on TV, etc.) where a dishonest act was performed. Point out the consequences to both the object of the act (the person or institution that was cheated or hurt or deceived) and the doer of the act. Also look for illustrations of honesty and mention the positive consequences, especially the inner peace, confidence, and self-respect gained by the honest individual.<br><br><b>Methods for Preschoolers<br><br>The Demonstration Game</b><br><br>This game can help small children grasp the concept and know the terminology.<br><br>Ask, "Do you know the difference between something that's true and something that's not true? Let's see if you do. I'll say something and you say, 'True' or 'Not true.'" Start with simple physical facts and move toward things relating to behavior, for example:<br><br>* The sky is green. (Kids say, "Not true.")<br><br>* (Point at foot) This is my foot. (Kids say, "True.")<br><br>* Ants are bigger than elephants.<br><br>* We see with our eyes.<br><br>* We hear with our nose.<br><br>* Milk comes from chickens.<br><br>* Take a cookie out of a jar and eat it. Then say, "I didn't eat the cookie."<br><br>* Drop a toy on the couch. Then say, "Yes, I left my toy on the couch."<br><br>Then say, "You really <i>can</i> tell the difference between true and not true, can't you? Do you know what it's called when someone says something that's not true? It's called a <i>lie."</i><br><br>Now: "I'll say some more things and you say, 'Truth' if it's true and 'Lie' if it's not true."<br><br>* Pick up a dollar on the floor. Then say, "I didn't find a dollar."<br><br>* Give a bit of food to someone else. Then say, "No, I didn't eat all my food. I gave some of it to --."<br><br>(Use illustrations appropriate to your child or children.)<br><br>Then ask, "Why is telling the truth better than telling a lie?" (So that everyone knows what really happened; so the wrong person won't get blamed; so we can learn to do better, etc.)<br><br><b>Give Effusive, Elaborate Praise</b><br><br>This encourages honesty on a day-to-day basis. Preschoolers will repeat behavior they receive attention for. They prefer positive attention (praise) to negative attention (reproval or punishment), but they prefer negative attention to no attention at all.<br><br>Therefore, when small children lie, try to give them as little attention as possible (other than quietly letting them know that you know it's not the truth). When they tell the truth, praise them extravagantly. And when they tell the truth in terms of admitting they did something wrong ("Who wrote on this wall?"), make the praise you give them for telling the truth outweigh the punishment or redress you give them for what they did. Preschoolers can understand the distinction and the separation between your displeasure with what they did and your pleasure with their truthfulness.<br><br>One interesting development in our family efforts to teach honesty occurred when our twenty-month-old baby, Charity, learned two now words. She already know how to say tho names of each of her eight brothers and sisters (or at least her version of those names). Then one weak she learned two new words: <i>did it.</i> With those words and her siblings' names she became an instant, expert tattletale. Whenever we asked, "Who made this mess?' or "Who squeezed the toothpaste out?" little Charity, who is a marvelously observant child, would tell us the answer.<br><br>One result was that tho other children became more thoroughly honest -- or at least more <i>quickly</i> honest about what they had done. Charity the Enforcer, one of her brothers began to call her. -- <b>Richard</b><br><br><b>The Honesty-About-Feelings Game</b><br><br>This will help small children realize that feelings are caused by what has happened -- and that it is okay to feel things and okay to tell others honestly how we feel. Go through a magazine (one with lots of ads and colored pictures) and point at faces saying, "How do you think he feels?" Then say, "Why do you think he feels that way?" Then say, "Is it okay to feel that way?"<br><br>Help children to identify feelings and their probable causes and to know that it's okay to feel those things and to tell other people how they feel.<br><br><b>Methods for Elementary<br><br>The Consequence Game</b><br><br>This game can help children understand that the long-term consequences of honesty are always better than the long-term consequences of dishonesty.<br><br>Prepare pairs of simple index cards or small sheets of paper. On one side of each of the cards in the pair describe two alternative courses of action -- one honest and one dishonest -- along with the short-term consequences of each action. Fill out the other side of the cards so that when the two cards are flipped over, the long-term consequences are revealed. Play it as a game, letting children decide, by looking at the front sides only, which option they would take.<br><br><i>Front sides:</i><br>You are at the store buying something and the clerk gives you $10 too much change. You keep it. After all, it was his mistake and not yours. You go into the toy store next door and buy some new handle grips for your bike.<br><br>When the clerk gives you the $10 extra change, you tell him he has given you too much and give the $10 back to him. He says thanks, but as you walk out, you start thinking about the new handle grips you could have bought with the $10.<br><br><i>Reverse sides:</i><br><br>You know the money wasn't yours. You start to worry that the clerk will have to pay the store $10 out of his wages. Whenever you ride your bike, the new handle grips remind you that you were dishonest.<br><br>You feel good and strong inside because you were honest. Whenever you ride your bike, you remember that you need handle grips, but you also remember that you were honest.<br><br><i>Front sides:</i><br><br>You are sitting in class taking a really hard test that you forgot to study for. The girl across the aisle seems to know all the answers, and her paper is so easy to see. You copy a few answers and end up getting an A- on the test.<br><br>You're a little mad at yourself for not studying harder and you're really worried about your grade. Still, you keep your eyes on your paper and do your best. Unfortunately your best that day is only a C on the test.<br><br><i>Reverse sides:</i><br><br>Your conscience bothers you. You know that you didn't deserve the A. You wonder if anyone saw you cheating. It's a little hard for you to get to sleep that night. On the next test you're unprepared again.<br><br>You resolve to study harder. Next test you do better. You like yourself because you know you are honest. Other people like you because they know you can be trusted.<br><br>Develop other cards to meet your own situation. Let the short-term consequence of a dishonest act be good, the long-term consequence bad. Develop cards on honesty with parents, with siblings, with friends, with institutions, and so on.<br><br>After playing the game ask the question What could a person do if he made the dishonest choice and felt bad about it afterward? (He could return the money, apologize, etc.)<br><br><b>The Honesty Pact</b><br><br>Decide in advance, within your family, to be strictly honest with each other. Toward the end of this "month" on honesty, get together as a family around the dinner table or on an outing. Thank the children for their help in thinking about honesty during the month. Review what everyone has learned. Ask if anyone knows what a "pact" is. Suggest that the family have a pact of strict honesty so that every family member can explicitly trust every other family member. Write up a short pact, starting with the words "We promise each other..." Let everyone (parents and children) sign the pact.<br><br><b>The Honesty-Under-Pressure Award</b><br><br>This is a motivational way to get children to evaluate their personal honesty every week. On Sundays (or whatever day you most often get your whole family together for a meal) ask, "Who had a situation this past week where it was a challenge to be honest?" Have an "award" on hand to give to the person who remembers the best incident of being honest. A piece of construction paper or colored card with a neatly printed H.U.P. (Honesty Under Pressure) will do nicely as the award. Let the child (or adult) who wins put it on his bedroom door during the week until it is awarded again the next week.<br><br>After a couple of weeks of "getting used to," you will find that children are willing to think hard about their behavior of the past week in hopes of winning the award. And it is this kind of thinking and recognition that strongly reinforces honesty.<br><br><b>Story: "Isabel's Little Lie"</b><br><br>Tell the following story to help your children understand how one lie can lead to another and produce serious consequences:<br><br>One day Isabel told a little lie. She wasn't supposed to feed her dinner to her dog, Barker, but she did, and when her mother came in and saw her plate all clean, Isabel said that she had eaten it all. (That was a little lie, wasn't it?) The dinner was chicken, and Barker got a bone in his throat. Pretty soon he started to cough and snort and act very uncomfortable.<br><br>"Do you know what's wrong with Barker?" asked Mother. "No," said Isabel. (That was another lie, wasn't it? But Isabel <i>had</i> to do it so that Mother wouldn't know she told the first lie.) Mother looked in Barker's mouth but couldn't see anything. "Did Barker eat something, Isabel?"<br><br>"I don't know, Mommy." (That was another lie, wasn't it? But she didn't want her mother to know about the first two lies.)<br><br>Barker got worse, and Mother took him to the animal hospital. Isabel went too. "What happened to the dog?" asked the doctor. "We don't know," said Isabel. (That was another lie, wasn't it? But if Isabel had told, then Mother and the dog doctor would know she had lied before.) The dog doctor said, "If it's just a bone, we could get it out with an instrument, but it might be glass, so we may have to operate."<br><br>Isabel decided it was time to tell the truth. She said, "It's a bone, and I <i>did</i> know Barker ate it, and I <i>didn't</i> eat all my dinner, and I <i>did</i> give it to Barker, and I won't tell lies anymore, because if you tell one, you might have to tell more and more." Isabel started to cry, but her mother loved her and she decided she really would tell the truth from then on.<br><br>(Note: Each chapter will have one or more children's stories illustrating that month's value -- written for elementary-age children but adaptable for younger or older children.)<br><br><b>The Pantomime Game</b><br><br>This game can help children to identify honest emotions -- in themselves and in others -- and to know that it is okay to feel and to talk about these emotions.<br><br>Write each of the following emotion-related adjectives on a small card. Shuffle the cards and give five to each family member. Each player has forty-five seconds to pantomime the actions (gestures, facial expressions, etc.) associated with the word on the card. Score one point for each motion correctly guessed. After each person has a turn, shuffle the cards and distribute five to each person again and repeat the process until one person scores 10 points. Eventually children will learn how to better display the emotions they feel as well as how to recognize them in others. The idea is to help children to accept their own emotions, recognize how others ar feeling, and be able to talk honestly about both.<br><br>Here is a list of emotions, feelings, and attitudes to pantomime:<br><br>loving<br><br>kind<br><br>optimistic<br><br>empathetic<br><br>grateful<br><br>loyal<br><br>sensitive<br><br>active<br><br>sly<br><br>mean<br><br>angry<br><br>envious<br><br>selfish<br><br>spoiled<br><br>resentful<br><br>remorseful<br><br>appreciative<br><br>nice<br><br>affectionate<br><br>serene<br><br>friendly<br><br>free<br><br>respectful<br><br>untruthful<br><br>unfriendly<br><br>defensive<br><br>fair<br><br>sorry<br><br>rude<br><br>concerned<br><br>trusting<br><br>calm<br><br>warm<br><br>tender<br><br>responsible<br><br>reliable<br><br>cooperative<br><br>honorable<br><br>foolish<br><br>greedy<br><br>unfair<br><br>insensitive<br><br>unequal<br><br>thoughtful<br><br>cheerful<br><br>helpful<br><br>forgiving<br><br>interested<br><br>gentle<br><br>passive<br><br>hurt<br><br>jealous<br><br>guilty<br><br>annoyed<br><br>disgusted<br><br>remorseful<br><br>cowardly<br><br><b>Methods for Adolescents<br><br>Analyze Types of Dishonesty</b><br><br>This kind of discussion can help older children to grasp the broader definitions of honesty and dishonesty.<br><br>Say, "There are really a lot of different types of dishonesty. Let's see how many we can list." With some encouragement children will list many of the following:<br><br>Cheating on tests<br><br>Cheating on taxes<br><br>Cheating on expense reports<br><br>Calling a ball out in a tennis game that you're not sure was out<br><br>Exaggerating<br><br>Telling someone they look nice when they really don't (flattery)<br><br>Not telling the whole truth so you won't get in trouble<br><br>Twisting the truth just a little so it won't sound so bad<br><br>Lying to protect yours...</p><h2>The Storyteller: Tales out of Loneliness</h2><p><b>A beautiful collection of the legendary thinker&#x2019;s short stories</b><br><br><i>The Storyteller</i> gathers for the first time the fiction of the legendary critic and philosopher Walter Benjamin, best known for his groundbreaking studies of culture and literature, including <i>Illuminations</i>, <i>One-Way Street</i> and <i>The Arcades Project</i>. His stories revel in the erotic tensions of city life, cross the threshold between rational and hallucinatory realms, celebrate the importance of games, and delve into the peculiar relationship between gambling and fortune-telling, and explore the themes that defined Benjamin. The novellas, fables, histories, aphorisms, parables and riddles in this collection are brought to life by the playful imagery of the modernist artist and Bauhaus figure Paul Klee.</p><p><b>Walter Benjamin</b> (1892&#x2013;1940) was a German&#x2013;Jewish Marxist literary critic, essayist, translator and phi-losopher. He was associated with the Frankfurt School of critical theory and is the author of <i>Illuminations</i>, <i>The Arcades Project</i>, and <i>The Origin of German Tragic Drama</i>.&#x201c;Walter Benjamin was the interlocutor of all the demons and angels of storytelling. And this is why he knew its endless secrets. Listen to him.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;John Berger</b><br><br> &#x201c;This volume collects an extraordinary array of short pieces by Walter Benjamin that lets us see the centrality of stories, dreams, and tales to his own experimental writings. During the time in which Benjamin sought to understand the conditions of communicability between languages, he was also testing the thesis in the stories he told. Telling the tale and reflecting on its very possibility, under conditions such as war and poverty, Benjamin gives us short forms that are broken up by interruptions and sudden closure. This elegant and moving volume is beautifully edited, including an introduction that shows how these collections of short tales and dream sequences are already doing the critical work of the essay form. This volume is a marvelous gift that will reorient our reading of Benjamin in startling ways.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Judith Butler</b><br><br> &#x201c;Much praise is due to the editors for bringing together a newly translated collection of [Walter Benjamin&#x2019;s] short fictions, in which he shows our iniquitous material world suffused and sabotaged by the uncanny like no one else.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Jacqueline Rose</b></p><h2>Letters Of A Woman Homesteader</h2><p>&#34;Peopled with the kinds of characters most novelists only dream of&#34;(Christian Science Monitor), this classic account of American frontier living captures the rambunctious spirit of a pioneer who set out in 1909 to prove that a woman could ranch.

Continuing the series begun with David Wells's No Place for Truth and God in the Wasteland, this acclaimed volume urges the church to regain its moral weight and become a missionary of truth once more to our relativistic postmodern world.</p></p><p>David F. Wells is the Andrew Mutch Distinguished Professor of Historical and Systematic Theology at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. An ordained Congregationalist minister, he is also the author of more than a dozen previous books.Noted evangelical theologian Wells (God in the Wasteland) weighs in on the perpetual problem of whether the church can retain its moral integrity and still play a vital role in today's culture. Wells argues that, in the postmodern world, the church is in danger of losing its moral character by compromising its teachings about virtue, including doctrines of sin and guilt, by making too many concessions to cultural teachings on virtue. Wells addresses his concerns by examining two kinds of spirituality that, he says, characterize the church. On the one hand, he says, classical or Reformation spirituality is the hallmark of Christianity, and he uses this spirituality to represent a general understanding of the doctrines, devotional habits and moral character of the Christian life. On the other hand, postmodern spirituality, Wells says, is forged in the interaction between biblical truth and the intuitions or instincts of the contemporary world. According to Wells, postmodern spirituality is more concerned with shame (falling short of what others expect of us) rather than sin (falling short of what God expects of us). Wells urges the church to return to classical spirituality and not to allow the message of that spirituality to be diminished by the cultural habits of the modern world. This argument is one that has recurred throughout history, but Wells makes it in plain language accompanied by a straightforward critique of the ways in which, he believes, secular culture's notions of virtue fall short of Christianity's. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Adventures in the Screen Trade</h2><p>As befits more than twenty years in Hollywood, Oscar-winning screenwriter William Goldman&#39;s sparkling memoir is as entertaining as many of the films he has helped to create.

The roots of Irish humor are complex: for centuries, classic Irish writers have used black humor and sarcasm, ranging from the satires of Jonathan Swift, George Bernard Shaw, and Oscar Wilde through to the hilarity of J.P. Donleavy and the sublime nonsense of Flann O&#x2019;Brien and Spike Milligan. This collection combines a pinch of traditional Irish humor&nbsp;mixed with distinctly modern one-liners, quips, and quotes from the best of the current crop of humorists.</p><p><b>Myles Byrne</b> is a musician, designer, and writer.</p><h2>Dead Man&#39;s Ransom (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)</h2><p>The year is 1141 and civil war continues to rage. When the sheriff of Shropshire is taken prisoner, arrangements are made to exchange him for Elis, a young Welshman. But when the sheriff is brought to the abbey, he is murdered. Suspicion falls on Elis, who has fallen in love with the sheriff&#39;s daughter. With nothing but his Welsh honor to protect him, Elis appeals to Brother Cadfael for help. And Brother Cadfael gives it, not knowing that the truth will be a trial for his own soul.</p><p><b>Ellis Peters</b> is the nom de plume used by author Edith Pargeter to write her bestselling 'Brother Cadfael' historical mysteries. Inspired by her interest in Shropshire history, she penned the first novel, <i>A Morbid Taste for Bones</i>, in 1977. This was followed by seventeen more novels and one book of short stories starring the crusader turned monk with a talent for detection. In 1993, she was awarded the Crime Writers' Association Diamond Dagger for lifetime achievement, and in 1999 the CWA established the Ellis Peters Historical Dagger Award (for the best historical crime novel of the year) in her honour. She was awarded an OBE in 1994 for services to literature. Ellis Peters died in 1995, aged 82.The cognoscenti know that Brother Cadfael, the Benedictine monk, practices medicine and solves crimes in medieval Britain. When a wounded Welsh POW is brought to him for treatment, he turns out to be a nobleman's son who can be exchanged for a captive of the Welsh. But before a swap can be finalized, murder foils the plans, and Cadfael must ferret out the guilty party. Philip Madoc, a mild and robust Cadfael, performs with an admirable cast in a typically workmanlike BBC Radio production.

In the <i>Summa</i> Aquinas works to save and purify the thought of the Greeks and the Arabs in the higher light of Christian Revelation, confident that all that had been rational in the ancient philosophers and their followers would become more rational within Christianity. This exposition and defense of divine truth has two main parts: the consideration of that truth that faith professes and reason investigates, and the consideration of the truth that faith professes and reason is not competent to investigate. The exposition of truths accessible to natural reason occupies Aquinas in the first three books of the <i>Summa</i>. His method is to bring forward demonstrative and probable arguments, some of which are drawn from the philosophers, to convince the skeptic. In the fourth book of the <i>Summa</i> St. Thomas appeals to the authority of the Sacred Scripture for those divine truths that surpass the capacity of reason. The present volume is the second part of a treatise on the hierarchy of creation, the divine providence over all things, and man&#x2019;s relation to God. Book 1 of the <i>Summa</i> deals with God; Book 2, Creation; and Book 4, Salvation.</p><p>St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) is a Doctor of the church. He was an Italian Dominican friar and Roman Catholic priest who was an influential philosopher, theologian, and jurist in the tradition of scholasticism. Canonized in 1323 by Pope John XXII, Aquinas was the foremost classical proponent of natural theology and the father of Thomism.</p><h2>Kingfisher</h2><p><b>In the new fantasy from the award-winning author of the Riddle-Master Trilogy, a young man comes of age amid family secrets and revelations, and transformative magic.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Hidden away from the world by his mother, the powerful sorceress Heloise Oliver, Pierce has grown up working in her restaurant in Desolation Point.

The line went slack in his hands. The tiered, circular frames of the net he had hauled up, dripping and writhing with crabs, slumped into one another. A fourth door opened; another head rose out of the driver&#x2019;s side, black-capped and masked with sunglasses. His voice queried something lost in a sudden squall of screeching gulls. The three shook their heads, turning from him toward the dock.</p><p>They were all, Pierce realized abruptly, staring back at him.</p><p>A crab hit his shoe, skittered over it. He glanced down hastily, pulled the rings taut again, knelt to shake crabs back into the net and bat the smaller escapees back into the sea. He felt the tremor of footsteps along the dock. Boots, black, supple, and glistening like nacre, came to a halt under his nose.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry to interrupt your work there, but could you tell us where in Severen&#x2019;s name we are?&#x201d;</p><p>Pierce, the crab net rope in one hand, a lime-green plastic measure in the other, opened his mouth. Nothing came out. The shadow stretching out from the boots on the dock seemed to have grown wings. They expanded darkly across the wood, rising to catch the wind. The boots under Pierce&#x2019;s transfixed gaze refused to levitate, ignoring the wings.</p><p>Then the broad, shadowy wings were gone, and he could lift his head finally, look helplessly up at the speaker, who had hair like cropped lamb&#x2019;s wool and eyes like a balmy afternoon sky in some other part of the world. The eyes were beginning to look more bemused than tranquil at Pierce&#x2019;s silence.</p><p>&#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t know either,&#x201d; the dark-haired man with a green jewel in one ear the color of his eyes guessed with a laugh. The third, a golden-haired giant as solidly massive as a slab of oak, flared suddenly, flames licking out all around him. Pierce jumped, dropping the crab measure.</p><p>&#x201c;Cape Mistbegotten,&#x201d; he gabbled hastily, not wanting to rile them into further displays of weirdness.</p><p>&#x201c;Mistbegotten?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Des&#x2014;Desolation Point.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Des&#x2014; Seriously?&#x201d;</p><p>A gull landed on the dock beside him with a sudden, fierce cry. After the crabs, he thought, but it stayed very still then, raking the strangers with its yellow-eyed glare. He retrieved the crab measure, stood up shakily, and realized that he had forgotten to take his apron off. It hung limply around his neck, untied and grubby from the kitchen, the trellis of green beans on it like some stained mimicry of a heraldic device. Another crab was snarled in his shoelace, trying to untie his ancient, cracked trainer.</p><p>&#x201c;Desolation Point,&#x201d; he repeated more clearly, though his mouth was still dry. The dark-haired man&#x2019;s shadow seemed to have grown a barbed tail; it lashed sinuously, soundlessly, as though to sweep the crabs off the dock. It stilled finally. Pierce closed his eyes tightly, opened them and his mouth again. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the only town on the cape. The sign got blown into the ocean during a winter storm. It&#x2019;s still a little early in the season for tourists; we haven&#x2019;t bothered to replace it yet.&#x201d;</p><p>They were gazing at him with varying degrees of incredulity. &#x201c;People come here?&#x201d; the fire-giant said dubiously. &#x201c;On purpose?&#x201d;</p><p>Pierce shook the crab off his shoe; it landed on its back, legs waving at him furiously. &#x201c;Like I said, it&#x2019;s the only town on Cape Mistbegotten.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then why isn&#x2019;t it on the map?&#x201d; the blond with the temperate eyes asked reasonably. &#x201c;Our driver couldn&#x2019;t even find it on paper.&#x201d;</p><p>Pierce grunted, puzzled. Something in the gull&#x2019;s grim eye, its oddly motionless stance, enlightened him. &#x201c;Oh, that was probably my mother. Sometimes she hides things and forgets.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your mother.&#x201d; The burly giant&#x2019;s face flattened suddenly, all expression gone. &#x201c;Hides. An entire cape.&#x201d; He had shifted suddenly very close to Pierce, forcing Pierce&#x2019;s head to angle upward. &#x201c;Are you mocking us? Do you have any idea who we are?&#x201d;</p><p>Pierce, caught helplessly in the hazel-eyed smolder, finally registered the odd crunch in the giant&#x2019;s wake. &#x201c;Not a clue,&#x201d; he said breathlessly. &#x201c;But you just squashed a perfectly good dinner crab.&#x201d;</p><p>The giant looked down at his boots, raised one slowly, grimacing at the legs dangling from the sole. The fair man with the wings dropped a hand on his shoulder, shook him lightly, fearlessly.</p><p>&#x201c;Temper, Bayley,&#x201d; he murmured. His eyes, on Pierce&#x2019;s face, widened in sudden comprehension. &#x201c;We must have wandered off the map into the realm of a sorceress.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Or a lunatic,&#x201d; the giant muttered, shaking crab off his boot.</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; The intense gaze fixed Pierce, held him motionless. &#x201c;He is the sorceress&#x2019;s son. That&#x2019;s why you couldn&#x2019;t speak. Isn&#x2019;t it? You saw something in us. Tell me what you saw.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I saw&#x2014;&#x201d; Pierce whispered, losing his voice again, &#x201c;I saw your shadow. Your wings. And I saw your fire,&#x201d; he added to the giant, then to the dark knight, &#x201c;I saw your barbed tail.&#x201d;</p><p>Suddenly, they were all smiling.</p><p>&#x201c;No wonder you lost your tongue,&#x201d; the giant marveled. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been up north, hunting our ancestors.&#x201d; He held up his brawny arm; Pierce saw the fine embroidered medallion on the black sleeve: a white bear outlined in flames. &#x201c;I am Sir Bayley Reeve. My ancestors took the Fire Bear. I&#x2019;m not sure how,&#x201d; he added with wonder. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s huge. She topped even me by a head.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And mine took the wyvern,&#x201d; said the man with the sea-green eyes. &#x201c;I am Roarke Wyvernbourne.&#x201d;</p><p>Pierce swallowed, speech swollen like a lump in his throat. Even Desolation Point, the outermost stretch of isolated land along the coast of Wyvernhold, got a newspaper now and then.</p><p>&#x201c;And mine the great Winter King of the north,&#x201d; the pale-haired man said. &#x201c;The Winter Merlin, who taught the ancient mage of the first Wyvernbourne king. Back when there were a dozen petty kingdoms and as many kings. That&#x2019;s what you saw in me: the falcon&#x2019;s wings. I am Sir Gareth May.&#x201d;</p><p>They waited, gazing at Pierce expectantly, until he found his wits again. &#x201c;Oh. Pierce Oliver.&#x201d; He started to hold out his hand, felt the crab net rope still in it.</p><p>&#x201c;Oliver,&#x201d; the Wyvernbourne prince murmured. &#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t there something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He shook his head, shrugging. &#x201c;Well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you&#x2014; Ah&#x2014; Did you actually&#x2014; I mean, with weapons? I thought they were already pretty much extinct?&#x201d;</p><p>The knights were silent for a breath; Pierce saw the memories, complex and mysterious, in their faces.</p><p>&#x201c;We came as close as we could,&#x201d; Gareth May said slowly. &#x201c;They leave a track. They leave a rumor. I climbed into the high forests, found the ancient nesting places of the Winter Merlins. I heard their voices in the wind. Maybe I saw one. Maybe it was a cloud. Maybe it was both.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I searched in fire,&#x201d; Bayley said. &#x201c;At night. Fire licking wood as the Fire Bear licks her newborn to turn them into flesh and blood; she swallows their fire, their immortality. Maybe I did that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I found the caves where the wyverns raised their young,&#x201d; the Wyvernbourne prince said. &#x201c;I saw their high nests, hollows of stone where they laid their eggs, said to make a noise like thunder when they cracked.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What we hunted, what we took, is what you saw,&#x201d; Gareth said simply. &#x201c;That you saw it so quickly, so easily&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the wonder. We were searching for what we found. You weren&#x2019;t looking for anything at all.&#x201d;</p><p>Again they were silent, consulting one another with their eyes. Pierce watched, fascinated by their closeness, their fellowship. The motionless gull, which he had forgotten, gave such a sudden, piercing cry that he nearly leaped off the dock. It sounded, he thought as he caught his breath, like a curse.</p><p>He glanced down, saw more crabs wobbling to the edge of the rings, toppling onto the dock. He bent to pluck a couple of likely-looking dinners up, toss them back into the net.</p><p>&#x201c;Look for us,&#x201d; he heard, &#x201c;if you come to Severluna. You might find a place for yourself in King Arden&#x2019;s court.&#x201d;</p><p>He straightened again, blinking at the thought. They were smiling at him again, welcoming him to their world, making him, for a moment that melted his heart, one of them. The moment passed; he was himself again, in all his awkwardness, his isolation, his inexperience: a young, tangle-haired man wearing a filthy apron at the end of a dock at the edge of the world, chasing after crabs instead of wyverns.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always lived here,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s home.&#x201d;</p><p>Bayley glanced bewilderedly at the tiny town lining the main street, doors facing the setting sun. The others refrained from looking. &#x201c;Oh. Well,&#x201d; the giant said gruffly, and added, &#x201c;Sorry about your dinner. Luckily there are more in your net.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re for my mother.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She owns the best restaurant on the cape. I was working in the kitchen earlier; that&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m wearing this ridiculous apron. Most of these are too small to keep.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about that one?&#x201d; the prince asked of the one Pierce had just thrown back into the net.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He pulled it out again, turned it over. &#x201c;Nope. It&#x2019;s female.&#x201d;</p><p>They gazed at it. Bayley broke the silence.</p><p>&#x201c;Hell can you tell?&#x201d;</p><p>Pierce tapped the band on the underside of the shell. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s wider on the females.&#x201d; He let it fall into the water; the young men watched the splash.</p><p>&#x201c;I could eat,&#x201d; Bayley murmured wistfully.</p><p>&#x201c;Her restaurant&#x2019;s open. It&#x2019;s called Haricot. There&#x2019;s crab on the lunch menu. Follow the street the direction you were going; it&#x2019;s just past the Wander Inn.&#x201d; He watched them query one another again. &#x201c;A motel,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;If you keep going the same direction out of town, the road will loop around the cape and take you back to the highway.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; They stirred then, stepped toward the waiting car, thoughts shifting away from Pierce, back to their journey. &#x201c;We appreciate the help.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll tell them at Haricot that you sent us,&#x201d; the dark prince said with his father&#x2019;s charming smile.</p><p>You won&#x2019;t have to, Pierce thought as the dock swayed under their receding steps, and the gull finally flew off. She knows.</p><p>The knights were long gone by the time he pulled up the rings in the late afternoon and carried them and a bucket full of squirming crabs to the Haricot kitchen.</p><p>His tall mother, nibbling a strawberry, glanced at him past the ear of Cape Mistbegotten&#x2019;s only sheriff. Her eyes, a rich blue-green, narrowed, questioning. Pierce took off the apron and scrubbed his hands at the sink, hearing her voice through the falling water.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I can look, Arn. But it&#x2019;s been a while since I&#x2019;ve done anything like that. I&#x2019;ve been retired for years; cooking is my magic now.&#x201d;</p><p>Ha, Pierce thought, and felt her gaze between his shoulder blades.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, Heloise,&#x201d; the sheriff said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the third time those interpretive signs and telescopes on the point have been vandalized, and I still haven&#x2019;t got a clue. If you could just&#x2014;Well, keep an eye on them now and then, when you have a moment.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll try to remember.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a short silence. Pierce, drying his hands, heard what Arn Brisket was not saying, what he&#x2019;d not been saying since the third time Heloise had told him no. Not for the first time, Pierce wondered why. Arn was decent, honest, with maybe more shoreline on his head since the first time she had said it, but his chestnut mustache was still bold and thick as a squirrel&#x2019;s tail. And it would be a timely solution. Pierce froze then, at that unexpected thought, staring at the towel in his hands with its little edging of green beans.</p><p>&#x201c;Pierce.&#x201d;</p><p>He looked up dazedly. Arn had gone; his mother, trying to retie her apron without tangling her long red braid in the strings, nodded in the direction of her office. Pierce went to her, took the ties out of her fingers. They seemed oddly chilly. He swallowed something hard in his throat.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just get the crab pot on to boil first.&#x201d;</p><p>She nodded again, briefly, left him without looking at him, her backbone straight and rigid as a flagpole.</p><p>Staff chattered again, voices muted, as he filled the huge pot with water. Arn, they talked about softly, and his stubborn, persistent longing, since his wife&#x2019;s death a decade ago, for the sorceress turned cook and gardener. Pierce heaved the pot onto the stove. His thoughts drifted to the strangers who had gotten so completely lost they had managed to find Desolation Point, the westernmost thrust of land on the entire Wyvernhold coast. So did everyone else&#x2019;s thoughts, then. The knights might have come and gone from Haricot, but they had left behind them vivid impressions. Pierce responded absently to the questions and comments as he lingered beside the crab bucket. The strange idea in his head took on clarity, dimension. He nudged an escaping crab back into the bucket and felt his mother&#x2019;s eyes again. But she wasn&#x2019;t visible; she was in her office, checking the evening menu or balancing accounts while she waited for him.</p><p>Or maybe sitting motionlessly, watching him out of a borrowed pair of eyes.</p><p>He left the crabs to the staff, went out the back door through her rambling, burgeoning kitchen garden, and drove home.</p><p>Home was on the outermost cliff on the cape, where it jutted into the wild sea amid the shards and wreckage of time and the raw, irresistible forces of nature. Shreds of morning mist still hung from the high branches of the ancient trees around the pile of stone and wood that had been Pierce&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s house. And his father&#x2019;s before him, and his father&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s, back to some distant past long before the watchtower that had guarded the headlands had been torn down to add a wing to the family hall.</p><p>&#x201c;This house is yours,&#x201d; his mother had told him years earlier, when he was too young to understand what she wasn&#x2019;t telling him. &#x201c;Your father gave it to me before he left us. Now I&#x2019;m giving it to you, so that you&#x2019;ll have something from him. So that you&#x2019;ll always have a home here with me and the trees and the sea.&#x201d;</p><p>Even then he had felt the twist of bitterness that this place was all he knew of a father: no voice, no expressions, no touch, only these huge, silent rooms full of heavy, ornate furniture and paintings of the dead who had liv...</p></p><h2>Inside the Mind of Unchurched Harry and Mary</h2><p><p>Who Are Unchurched Harry and Mary?

Montgomery heard a local story about a great flood that bore a striking similarity to Noah&#x2019;s Flood. Intrigued, Montgomery began investigating the world&#x2019;s flood stories and&#x2015;drawing from historic works by theologians, natural philosophers, and scientists&#x2015;discovered the counterintuitive role Noah&#x2019;s Flood played in the development of both geology and creationism. Steno, the grandfather of geology, even invoked the Flood in laying geology&#x2019;s founding principles based on his observations of northern Italian landscapes. Centuries later, the founders of modern creationism based their irrational view of a global flood on a perceptive critique of geology. With an explorer&#x2019;s eye and a refreshing approach to both faith and science, Montgomery takes readers on a journey across landscapes and cultures. In the process we discover the illusive nature of truth, whether viewed through the lens of science or religion, and how it changed through history and continues changing, even today. 20 illustrations; maps</p><p><strong>David R.

Finding examples in the writing of every country and century, from Mencius to William Faulkner or C�line, he concentrates on an analysis of certain works and forms in English literature, several of them, like <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, <em>Troilus</em> and <em>Cressida</em>, and proletarian novels not traditionally considered pastoral.

In the hugely popular Honor Harrington series, the spirit of C.S. Forester&#x2019;s Horatio Hornblower and Patrick O&#x2019;Brian&#x2019;s <i>Master and Commander </i>lives on&#x2014;into the galactic future. Books in the Honor Harrington and Honoverse series have appeared on fourteen best seller lists, including those of <i>The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times</i>, and <i>USA Today.</i> While Weber is best known for his spirited, modern-minded space operas, he is also the creator of the Oath of Swords fantasy series and the Dahak saga. Weber has also written highly popular collaborations, including his Starfire Series with Steve White, which produced the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>The Shiva Option</i> among others<i>. </i>Weber&#x2019;s collaboration with alternate history master Eric Flint led to the bestselling <i>1634: The Baltic War, </i>and his planetary adventure novels with military science fiction ace and multiple national best-seller John Ringo includes the blockbusters <i>March to the Stars </i>and<i> We Few. </i>Finally, Weber&#x2019;s teaming with Linda Evans produced the bestselling<i> </i>Multiverse series. David Weber makes his home in South Carolina with his wife and children.<br> <br> <b>Jane Lindskold</b> is the award-winning, bestselling author of over twenty novels, including the incredibly popular Firekeeper series <i>(Through Wolf&#x2019;s Eyes</i> though <i>Wolf&#x2019;s Blood)</i>, as well as over sixty shorter works of science fiction and fantasy. Several of her novels have been chosen by VOYA for their Best SF, Fantasy and Horror list. Lindskold's work has been repeatedly praised for its sensitive depiction of worlds and cultures different from our own -- especially those that aren't in the least human. Her works have been praised as "intricate, beautifully written" (<i>Voya</i>), "attention-grabber" (<i>School Library Journal</i>), "engrossing" (<i>Miami Herald</i>), "Thrilling" (<i>Publisher's Weekly</i>), "ripping good fantasy" (<i>Kliatt</i>). Reviewer Charles deLint called Lindskold "one of those hidden treasures of Amerian letters." She has been a frequent contributor to the Honorverse, where her tales of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Michael have a loyal and enthusiastic following.Now that the Fire Season on Sphinx is over, Stephanie Harrington and her fellow provisional ranger Karl are offered the unique chance to study in the forestry service program on the nearby planet Manticore. It&#x2019;s an exciting opportunity, and while Stephanie worries how it will affect her burgeoning romance with the dashing Anders, it&#x2019;s too good to pass up, especially given that the program is accommodating her unique relationship with the treecat Lionheart, with which she is deeply bonded. Of course, nothing is as simple as it appears, and both Steph and Karl are soon caught up in the political intrigue centered around the treecats. This continuation of the Star Kingdom series may leave newcomers a bit lost, but as the authors&#x2019; nimbly build the background of Weber&#x2019;s Honorverse, the history and complex connections will fall into place, and those who missed the series&#x2019; start, A Beautiful Friendship (2011), will want to follow up and discover what they missed.

In these high, green hills, the air is pure, the village is charming, and the people are generally lovable. Yet, Father Tim, the bachelor rector, wants something more. Enter a dog the size of a sofa who moves in and won't go away. Add an attractive neighbor who begins wearing a path through the hedge. Now, stir in a lovable but unloved boy, a mystifying jewel theft, and a secret that's sixty years old. Suddenly, Father Tim gets more than he bargained for. And readers get a rich comedy about ordinary people and their ordinary lives.</p><p>Father Tim, a cherished small-town rector, is the steadfast soldier in this beloved slice of life story set in an American village where the grass is still green, the pickets are still white, and the air still smells sweet. The rector's forthright secretary, Emma Garret, worries about her employer, as she sees past his Christian cheerfulness into his aching loneliness. Slowly but surely, the empty places in Father Tim's heart do get filled. First with a gangly stray dog, later with a seemingly stray boy, and finally with the realization that he is stumbling into love with his independent and Christian-wise next-door neighbor. Much more than a gentle love story, this is a homespun tale about a town of endearing characters-- including a mysterious jewel thief--who are as quirky and popular as those of <i>Mayberry, R.F.D.</i> <i>--Gail Hudson</i><b>Jan Karon </b>is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of fourteen novels in the Mitford series, featuring Episcopal priest Father Tim Kavanagh.

Reciprocating steam engines have been eliminated. Pumps, pumping systems, and heat exchangers are given extensive coverage. Computer applications for machinery and system management are presented, including an entire chapter on maintenance management. Relevant material on international and national laws, classification society requirements, and standards, such as ISO 9000 series and the ISM code, are included in the text. The characteristics of fuels are presented along with a discussion of fuel testing and analysis, and a section on bunkering.

Intellectually brilliant, fearless and profound, he became a leading Victorian liberal thinker, whose works - including <i>On Liberty</i>, <i>Utilitarianism</i>, <i>The Subjection of Women </i>and this <i>Autobiography</i> - are among the crowning achievements of the age. Here he describes the pressures placed on him by his childhood, the mental breakdown he suffered as a young man, his struggle to understand a world of feelings and emotions far removed from his father's strict didacticism, and the later development of his own radical beliefs. A moving account of an extraordinary life, this great autobiography reveals a man of deep integrity, constantly searching for truth.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>Through Mill&#39;s autobiography, the social and political climate of nineteenth century England comes alive. The reader is given new insights into the events of an age: the reform movements, the English-Irish question, the development of democratic principles. With candor and perception, Mill discusses these issues and explains how they influenced his writing and thinking.<b>John Stuart Mill </b>(1806-73) was educated by his father and through his influence obtained a clerkship at India House. He formed the Utilitarian Society which met to read and discuss essays, and in 1825 he edited Bentham&#x2019;s <b>Treatise upon Evidence</b>. In 1826 he suffered an acute mental crisis and found that poetry helped him recover the will to live, particularly the work of Wordsworth. Having reconsidered his aims and those of the Benthamite school, he met Harriet Taylor and she inspired a great deal of his philosophy. They married in 1851. <b>Utilitarianism </b>was published in 1861 but before that Mill published his <b>System of Logic </b>(1843), <b>Principles of Political Economy </b>(1848) and <b>On Liberty </b>(1839). His other works include his classic <b>Autobiography </b>(1873). Mill retired in 1858 and became the independent MP for Westminster from 1865 to 1868. He spent the rest of his life in France and died in Avignon.</p><h2>Bury My Heart at Chuck E. Cheese&#39;s</h2><p>Why is there no Native woman David Sedaris? Or Native Anne Lamott? Humor categories in publishing are packed with books by funny women and humorous sociocultural-political commentary&#x2014;but no <i>Native</i> women. There are presumably more important concerns in Indian Country. More important than humor? Among the Din�/Navajo, a ceremony is held in honor of a baby&#x2019;s first laugh. While the context is different, it nonetheless reminds us that laughter is precious, even sacred.<br><br><i>Bury My Heart at Chuck E. Cheese&#x2019;s</i> is a powerful and compelling collection of Tiffany Midge&#x2019;s musings on life, politics, and identity as a Native woman in America.&nbsp;Artfully blending sly humor, social commentary, and meditations on love and loss, Midge weaves short, stand-alone musings into a memoir that stares down colonialism while chastising hipsters for abusing pumpkin spice.&nbsp;She explains why she does not like pussy hats, mercilessly dismantles pretendians, and confesses her own struggles with white-bread privilege. &nbsp;<br><br> Midge goes on to ponder Standing Rock, feminism, and a tweeting president, all while exploring her own complex identity and the loss of her mother. Employing humor as an act of resistance, these slices of life and matchless takes on urban-Indigenous identity disrupt the colonial narrative and provide commentary on popular culture, media, feminism, and the complications of identity, race, and politics.<br><br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Tiffany Midge </b>is a citizen of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and was raised in the Pacific Northwest. She is a former columnist for <i>Indian Country Today</i> and taught writing and composition for Northwest Indian College.

But it is much more than funny: it is moving, honest, and painful as well, and looks at the absurdities of modern America.

Where else can one find discussion of the use of &#x2018;ugh&#x2019; in American literature or of Anne Coulter and Delores Abernathy as judges in the post-election U.S. Open in Racist Tirades Competition?

Diet: Lose Up to 10 Pounds in Just 2 Weeks Eating 6 Meals a Day!</h2><p>On the heels of the bestselling success of his low-calorie <em>Now Eat This!</em> cookbook, Rocco Dispirito expands his brand with a weight-loss program guaranteed to produce maximum results with minimum effort.<br><br>Award-winning celebrity chef Rocco DiSpirito changed his life and his health-without giving up the foods he loves or the flavor. He has lost more than 20 pounds, participated in dozens of triathlons, and-after an inspirational role as a guest chef on <em>The Biggest Loser-</em>changed his own diet and the caloric content of classic dishes on a larger scale. In the <em>Now Eat This! Diet</em>, complete with a foreword by Dr. Mehmet Oz, DiSpirito offers readers a revolutionary 2-week program for dropping 10 pounds quickly, with little effort, no deprivation, and while still eating 6 meals a day and the dishes they crave, like mac &amp; cheese, meatloaf, BBQ pork chops, and chocolate malted milk shakes. The secret: Rocco's unique meal plans and his 75 recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, and snack time, all with zero bad carbs, zero bad fats, zero sugar, and maximum flavor. Now readers can eat more and weigh less-it's never been so easy!</p><p>Rocco DiSpirito entered the Culinary Institute of America at the age of sixteen, and at eighteen began working with legendary chefs worldwide. The James Beard award-winning chef opened the 3-star Union Pacific in New York City, where he established his culinary credentials. He was named <em>Food &amp; Wine's</em> Best New Chef and--as the first chef to grace its cover--was called 'America's Most Exciting Young Chef' by <em>Gourmet</em>. DiSpirito starred in the NBC hit reality series <em>The Restaurant</em>, and the A&amp;E series <em>Rocco Gets Real</em>. He has appeared on <em>Oprah</em>, <em>Ellen</em>, <em>Chelsea Lately</em>, and <em>The Tonight Show</em>, among others.A follow-up to the author's popular Now Eat This! cookbook, this volume offers an uncomplicated plan for cutting calories and losing weight, in two sections. The first explains how the diet works and how it's possible to eat tasty foods made from healthier ingredients, offers basic advice about exercise, and delineates a "14 Day Fast Track Plan" for kick-starting weight loss by eating 1,400 calories per day (1,200 for women). The second section delivers 75 recipes designed to fit into that low-cal meal plan. They're color-coded by calorie counts so it's easy to pick recipes to fit into a day's overall total. Breakfast choices include a sunrise sandwich with eggs-egg substitute, actually-and Canadian bacon on a whole-wheat English muffin for 279 calories. Bacon appears again in DiSpiritio's version of the BLT, a bacon, lettuce, and tomato roll with 245 calories, thanks to the use of fat-free mayo and a touch of crumbled bacon instead of several bacon strips per sandwich. Spicy-sweet linguine alla vodka gets its creaminess from 2% Greek yogurt and clocks in at 307 calories per serving. There are desserts, too, like red velvet chocolate squares in which beets lend moisture, and agave nectar instead of sugar serves as sweetener. The recipes are mostly super (more like assembling ingredients than cooking) and the prose is straightforward (if a little choppy and repetitive)-meaning just about anyone who wants to should be able to follow this plan and lighten up mealtimes.

A radical revolutionary? A wise teacher? There have been many of these, too. In his latest book, renowned Scripture scholar Gerhard Lohfink asks, What is unique about Jesus of Nazareth, and what did he really want?</p><p>Lohfink engages the perceptions of the first witnesses of his life and ministry and those who handed on their testimony. His approach is altogether historical and critical, but he agrees with Karl Barth's statement that "historical criticism has to be more critical."</p><p>Lohfink takes seriously the fact that Jesus was a Jew and lived entirely in and out of Israel's faith experiences but at the same time brought those experiences to their goal and fulfillment. The result is a convincing and profound picture of Jesus.</p></p><p><p>Gerhard Lohfink was professor of New Testament exegesis at the University of T�bingen. Since 1986, he has lived and worked as a theologian for the Catholic Integrated Community. His many books include&nbsp;<i>No Irrelevant Jesus</i>, <i>Jesus of Nazareth</i>, <i>Does God Need the Church?,</i>&nbsp;<i>Is This All There Is?</i>, and <i>The Our Father</i>, all from Liturgical Press.</p><p></p><p></p>This reviewer has read many books on the historical Jesus, but this one is the best.

But much will depend on whether or not scholars will dismiss it as lacking uniqueness and innovation, and whether or not non-professionals will invest the energy in reading a scholarly treatment of Jesus. May both groups stretch themselves and give it the attention it so richly deserves!Michael J. Bowling, The Englewood Review of Books<br><br>The thread connecting what Jesus wanted, who he was, is the reign of God. Lohfink is concerned with this new thing that came into the world with [Jesus]. The consistency between this reign of God and the revelation of who Jesus is, is the chief message and controlling method of this book. The importance of another book on Christ and on Jesus in the New Testament in particular cannot be ignored or underestimated. . . . Lohfink gives the lie to any separation of what Jesus wanted from who he was. Ultimately, Christology consists in clarifying his relationship to God and humanity.<br>Kevin O'Gorman, The Furrow<br><br><br>Lohfink's portrait of Jesus is very much worth reading. Because he looks to the Gospels with a sympathetic yet critical eye, he gives a faithful interpretation of Jesus. And because he is faithful, Lohfink offers a portrait that is challenging-especially for the church today.<br>Thomas D.

His exploration party lost contact with their ships, set out northward on foot, and traveled, their numbers soon reduced from 300 to 4, across Florida, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and northern Mexico for the next eight years. In addition to being one of the great true adventure stories of all time, Cabeza de Vaca's account of their travels is an unparalleled source of firsthand information on the pre-European Southwest--the variety of its climate, its flora and fauna, the customs of its natives. They were the first to see the opossum and the buffalo, the Mississippi and the Pecos, pine-nut mash and mesquite-bean flour. This book contains the first description in literature of a West Indies Hurricane. </p><br><p>"Cabeza de Vaca was not only a physical trailblazer: he was also a literary pioneer, and he deserves the distinction of being called the Southwest's first writer.... <i>The Relaci�n</i>, while not fiction, possesses most of the attributes of a good novel."--William T.

Ben Franklin is a clever young printer&#x2019;s apprentice with a fondness for wise aphorisms.

When she is not writing, she performs under a different name with a theater group in that city. Bailey has always loved theater, and when she began to write her first historical mystery, it was a natural choice to select Stratford-on-Avon, the home of the great William Shakespeare, as the setting for a tale of trickery, murder, and detective work.The Secret Of The Sealed Room One <p></p> <br>What signifies your patience, if you can&#x2019;t find it <br>when you want it?<br>&#x2014;<i>Poor Richard&#x2019;s Almanac</i><br> <br>My name is Patience, but I have little of that with all those in Boston who keep telling me what a bad girl I am. When I learned my letters, the very first sentence I could read proved a harsh and scolding one: <i>In Adam&#x2019;s fall, we sinned all.</i> In church of a Sunday when the parson preaches about the sins and failings of women, I would swear he gazes straight at me with a stern, disapproving look. And of course Mrs. Worth, to whom my father bound me as a servant when my mother died, always assured me that I am a lazy, sullen, disobedient, and wicked wretch, destined to come to an evil end.<br> <br>But let me begin at the beginning, on a September day in the year of our Lord 1721. Mrs. Worth had rung her bell for me early, before the sun had risen, and I found her groaning in her bed. &#x201c;Child,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;run and fetch Moll Bacon, and hurry!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I must dress&#x2014;,&#x201d; I began, only to be cut short by her angry words: &#x201c;Go, I tell you! Go, and hurry!&#x201d;<br> <br>Still I dressed hastily, then set out running from the Worth house, on its low hill overlooking the Roxbury Road, right down Orange Street and so to Newbury Street and then into the still-sleeping heart of Boston. Mists crept through the streets like silent cats, gray in the dimness before dawn. Hardly any faint yellow lights showed, but I knew the way right well: along Marlborough and Cornhill streets south of the Common, then a sharp turn onto Water Street, with its narrow shops and dark, looming warehouses. A lonely rooster crowed somewhere, and then another answered him, and another. Dogs barked as I hurried through the damp and the dark, feeling the wet cobbles slippery beneath the thin soles of my worn-out shoes, shivering in the coolness of the early-September morning.<br> <br>The fishermen were up already, of course. Far ahead, down toward the Long Wharf, I could see the reddish glows of their lanterns on the face of the night. I even heard a distant fisherman&#x2019;s gruff, growling voice singing the words of a doleful old ballad:<br><br>&#x201c;As I walked forth one summer&#x2019;s day<br> <br>To view the meadows green and gay,<br> <br>A pleasant bower I espied<br> <br>Standing fast by the riverside,<br> <br>And in&#x2019;t a maiden I heard cry:<br> <br><i>Alas! Alas! There&#x2019;s none e&#x2019;er loved as I.</i>&#x201d;<br><br>Having no time to listen, I hurried on until I came to a great warehouse that smelled strongly of fish, and I began to count the buildings beyond it, two, three, four, and there I turned into the pitch-dark, narrow alley that leads back around the corner to Moll Bacon&#x2019;s cottage. Though small, it nestles in a neat and clean yard blooming with little herb and flower gardens, and the white paint on the house and its picket fence is smart and fresh-looking, or at least it is in sunlight. In the darkness both seemed to glow a pearly gray.<br> <br>Early though it was, as I approached Moll Bacon&#x2019;s cottage, I glimpsed candlelight through a window, and when I rapped at the door, the old midwife opened it at once. She was already dressed, as if she really had the second sight that some in Boston whispered fearfully about. &#x201c;What is it, girl?&#x201d; she asked gruffly.<br> <br>I did not flinch from her, though she had a dark face sharp as an Indian tomahawk, all sharp angles and cutting edges, and beneath her heavy black brows her scowl made her look as fierce as the old Abenaki warrior she claimed as her grandfather. &#x201c;My mistress wants you,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>She grunted and tilted her head. &#x201c;You are the Martin girl. You belong to Abedela Worth.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I belong to myself,&#x201d; I said with as much spirit as I could, meeting her dark-eyed gaze. &#x201c;But I work for Mrs. Worth.&#x201d;<br> <br>She laughed then, one sharp, gruff bark, and she turned half away from me as she reached for something&#x2014;a large basket, I saw. &#x201c;Come, then, Patience Martin, and let&#x2019;s see to the woman you work for.&#x201d;<br> <br>Moll did not lock the door, and answering my glance rather than my words she said, &#x201c;None in Boston would dare come in without my permission. Fast walking will warm us, girl. Carry this.&#x201d;<br> <br>I took the basket, which was covered with a calico cloth and as heavy as a load of stone, but no answer did I make. Only a month or so earlier, when Mrs. Worth first suspected that she was with child, had I met this strange woman. That very first time she had curtly told me not to call her Mistress Bacon, or even Goody Bacon, as some of the older people did. &#x201c;Moll&#x2019;s my name, and that&#x2019;s what you shall call me,&#x201d; she had said. Since that first time, Moll Bacon had come to the house often, sometimes two or three times each week, for Mrs. Worth was having a hard time of it. I should have felt sorry for her, a poor widow woman whose husband was three months drowned and herself four months gone in pregnancy. I could not feel much sympathy for her, though, with my own father dead in the same ship as her husband, and my future so clouded, and her hand so hard and so ready to slap me for any small failing on my part. Perhaps my lack of compassion was another measure of my badness.<br> <br>We trotted along side by side in the slowly growing light of dawn. Moll spoke little, but once she suddenly asked, for no reason that I could see, &#x201c;How old are you, girl?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fourteen last month,&#x201d; I replied, panting. I understood that Moll Bacon herself was no more than forty-five, though I thought she looked a good twenty years older, and she made a good pace of it, so that I had to scurry to keep up, never getting a chance to catch my breath. We reached the house, and I saw lights in the downstairs windows. The chickens were awake now, murmuring and scratching about the backyard. I started toward them, for Mrs. Worth was very strict about my never coming in through the front door, but that opened as Moll and I stepped into the yard. A tall, thin, gray man beckoned impatiently for us to come in that way: Mr. Richard Worth, Mrs. Worth&#x2019;s brother-in-law. He was past fifty&#x2014;Mrs. Worth&#x2019;s husband, Jared, his older brother, had been sixty when he drowned&#x2014;and he had a sharp, waspish manner. He and his son, David, were Mrs. Worth&#x2019;s nearest neighbors. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s very ill,&#x201d; snapped Mr. Richard. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d best hurry.&#x201d; He turned his gaze on me. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t stand there with your basket! Go with her. Make yourself useful!&#x201d;<br> <br>I gave him a barely polite nod of my head, and together with Moll I hurried up the stair to the second-floor bedroom, where my mistress lay moaning dolefully.<br> <br>Mrs. Worth, her already thin cheeks sunken, lay back on her feather pillow, her brown hair hidden beneath her nightcap. Her red-rimmed eyes glittered in anger as we came into the gloomy room. &#x201c;Why did you take so long?&#x201d; she demanded in an unnaturally hoarse voice.<br> <br>&#x201c;I came as quickly as I could,&#x201d; replied Moll. &#x201c;Are you in pain?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My head is splitting, and my stomach is cramping terribly. I am afraid I might lose the baby.&#x201d;<br> <br>Moll took the basket from me, then pointed to the fine beeswax candle that Mrs. Worth used to read by at night. &#x201c;Child, light that for me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; grumbled Mrs. Worth. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too expensive to burn idly while there is daylight. Open the curtains instead.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; I said. It did not do to cross her in anything, however small. I drew and tied back the curtains from the room&#x2019;s two windows, and the milky light of early day spilled into the dim bedroom. I could not help thinking that the candle would have given Moll considerably more illumination.<br> <br>&#x201c;I need you to take this,&#x201d; Moll said, handing me a small, nearly weightless cloth bag that felt as if it contained dried herbs, &#x201c;and boil it in a pint of water. When the pot begins to bubble, drop this in, and boil it until you can count to a hundred, slowly&#x2014;you can count, can&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course I can count!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She is a tetchy, forward child,&#x201d; said Mrs. Worth, adding a dismal groan.<br> <br>Moll ignored her: &#x201c;Count to a hundred, slowly, and then take the pot off the stove and allow it to steep for a quarter of an hour. Then pour off the tea that is brewed, put it in a mug, and bring it to me. Throw away the bag, for the medicine will have no virtue for a second boiling.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I understand.&#x201d;<br> <br>Downstairs Mr. Richard was standing beside a fire he had just lit in the parlor grate, his gray hair untidy as though he had been sweeping his hands through it. &#x201c;How is my sister-in-law?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Moll Bacon is nursing her now, sir. I&#x2019;m to make a medicinal tea from this.&#x201d; I held up the little cloth bag.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t show it to me! Be about it, then.&#x201d;<br> <br>I bowed my head, grinding my teeth at his snappish tone. &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>The kitchen stove was dark and cold, of course. I was used to attending to it, though, because Mrs. Worth was so near with a shilling that she refused to hire anyone to help me around the house&#x2014;though I had heard gossips in the street say that her husband had left her very well set, with not only the house and land but a steady income from his investments in ships and trade. As quickly as I could, I raked out the white and gray ashes from the wood-box into the ash scuttle, then piled in some brown and sharp-scented pine shavings as tinder. Atop that I built a small pyramid of kindling&#x2014;splints of more pine, which would catch easy and burn fast&#x2014;and then, to weigh that down, a few hickory logs. I got the tinderbox and struck fire with it, then set a splinter alight and touched it to the wood shavings until they were burning. The kindling began to crackle, and the fragrant pine sap started to ooze and flow. I put in two more lengths of hickory and closed the wood-box door. The stove top would be hot in a matter of minutes.<br> <br>While it heated, I went out to the well and drew a pail of fresh water. The hens came clustering around me, wanting to be fed, and the rooster perched on top of the coop, flapped his wings, and crowed piercingly, and I imagined him proclaiming, <i>Day, it&#x2019;s day, it&#x2019;s day, it&#x2019;s da-a-a-y!</i> Filled, the water pail was heavy, and I had to use two hands to carry it back to the kitchen, taking care not to splash it out as I waded through the impatient chickens. I used the late Mr. Worth&#x2019;s pint beer mug to measure the water into the cast-iron teapot and then put the pot on to boil. Mr. Richard had come to the doorway. &#x201c;Child, don&#x2019;t be idle! Make me a bit of breakfast while I wait.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>I scrambled two eggs in butter and fried a nice slice of bread. By then the teapot was bubbling, so I dropped in the little cloth bag. Mr. Richard sat at the table and ate the bread and eggs, drinking only water that he dipped from the pail. His brother, Mrs. Worth&#x2019;s husband, had been a sailor and a sea captain, used to drinking pale ale with breakfast and a glass of rum mixed with water with dinner, but Mr. Richard abstained from all alcohol except a little glass of wine now and then. He served as a deacon in the Congregational Church, and I knew full well that he had never approved of his older brother&#x2019;s ways or habits. I stood by the stove with my chin down, murmuring under my breath.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; he growled at me. &#x201c;Praying?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Counting,&#x201d; I said, skipping from fifty to fifty-two because I had paused to speak.<br> <br>&#x201c;Better for you to pray,&#x201d; he muttered. &#x201c;Where is that son of mine?&#x201d;<br> <br>He did not expect me to answer, and so I didn&#x2019;t, simply going on in my count until I whispered &#x201c;one hundred&#x201d; to myself and took the kettle off the stove. I went to the parlor to look at the clock. The minute hand stood at six minutes before the hour.<br> <br>I had time to eat. Back in the kitchen I fried a little piece of bread for myself and cut a small wedge of cheese from the hoop in the pantry. Mr. Richard pushed away from the table and left me alone as he returned restlessly to the parlor. I finished the bread and cheese, then put our dishes and the frying pan into the wash basin.<br> <br>In the front parlor, where Mr. Richard stood moodily in front of the fire he had built, staring down into it with his hands clasped behind him, I checked the clock again. The minute hand now touched eight minutes after the hour. I waited until it nicked off another minute, and then I went back to the kitchen. As Moll had directed, I poured the tea into the mug&#x2014;it was a dark greenish-brown liquid, smelling faintly of licorice&#x2014;and threw the sodden bag of herbs into the slop pail.<br> <br>Mrs. Worth looked a little calmer when I brought the tea into the bedroom. &#x201c;Here we are,&#x201d; said Moll. &#x201c;Drink this down. It will do you good.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where is Richard?&#x201d; asked Mrs. Worth querulously as she struggled to sit up in bed, propped against both of her pillows.<br> <br>&#x201c;He is down in the parlor,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;I made breakfast for him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You gave him my food?&#x201d; she demanded with a cross glance. &#x201c;What did he eat, and how much?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just two eggs and a slice of bread.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Remember that,&#x201d; she said, shaking a bony finger at me. &#x201c;He will have to repay me!&#x201d; She took a little, cautious sip of the tea and made a sour face at the taste of it.<br> <br>&#x201c;I should attend to my chores,&#x201d; I said to Moll, in a small voice.<br> <br>Mrs. Worth drank the rest of the liquid from the mug, making &#x201c;Gahh!&#x201d; sounds after each noisy swallow. &#x201c;Go,&#x201d; Moll said to me. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need you here right now. But boil more water.&#x201d;<br> <br>I put more water on the stove, went out and fed the chickens, and then came back inside. With part of the heated water I washed and rinsed the dishes. Then I dried and put them away and threw the dishpan of still-steaming water out into the side yard. The sun was well up now, the day breezy, with scudding raggedy gray and white clouds now and then dimming the light. I went on to my other daily chores, dusting and sweeping, scouring the front steps, and so on. Just before noon Mr. Richard told me to go next door to see if his son, David, was home and to tell him to come over if he was.<br> <br>&#x201c;Next door,&#x201d; he said, but it was a little walk away, for here the houses were not close-packed, as they were in the heart of town. I tapped on the back door of Mr. Richard&#x2019;s two-story home&#x2014;a small house only when compared to his brother&#x2019;s three-story one; Mr. Richard said that an earthly mansion was nothing but a sinful vanity that the Lord would punish in due time&#x2014;and Mr. David answered on my second knock.<br> <br>He was twenty-two years old, not very tall but thin, like his father, with a head of thick, curly, auburn-brown hair and quick, darting brown eyes. &#x201c;Patience,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;How is my aunt?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sick and in bed, sir,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;Your father asks that you come over.&#x201d;<br> <br>A pained expression crossed his face. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry that she&#x2019;s ill,&#x201d; he told me. Mr. David&#x2019;s voice always sounded strange in my ear. His father had sent him across the Atlantic Ocean to Cambridge in England to be schooled, and during his four years there he had lost the Boston accent and had picked up a kind of drawling English one. He had returned home only the previous September, and if street gossip were true, he cut quite a figure among the young ladies of Boston&#x2014;and among those rakish young men who gamble and live riotously in secret&#x2014;though I try never to listen to such tattling tales. &#x201c;Is she suffering much?&#x201d; he asked me.<br> <br>&#x201c;I cannot tell,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;She said some while ago that her stomach and head were troubling her. Moll Bacon is giving her medicines, though, and now she seems...</p><h2>Knitting Lingerie Style: More Than 30 Basic and Lingerie-Inspired Designs</h2><p>The only knitting book focused on lingerie and lingerie-inspired designs<br><br>Underwear has come out.

A year before, a stunning Swedish student disappeared from Oxfordshire, leaving behind a rucksack with her identification. As the lady was dishy, young, and traveling alone, the Thames Valley Police suspected foul play. But without a body, and with precious few clues, the investigation ground to a halt. Now it seems that someone who can hold back no longer is composing clue-laden poetry that begins an enthusiastic correspondence among England's news-reading public. Not one to be left behind, Morse writes a letter of his own--and follows a twisting path through the Wytham Woods that leads to a most shocking murder.</p><p><b>Colin Dexter</b>&nbsp;twice won the Gold Dagger Award, the Crime Writers' Association's honor for the best novel of the year. He was the author of many novels, novellas, and short stories featuring Inspector Morse. He died in 2017.Chapter One<br> &nbsp;<br> A perpetual holiday is a good working definition of Hell<br> (George Bernard Shaw)<br> &nbsp;<br> Morse never took his fair share of holidays, so he told himself. So he was telling Chief Superintendent Strange that morning in early June.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Remember you&#x2019;ve also got to take into consideration the time you regularly spend in pubs, Morse!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A few hours here and there, perhaps, I agree. It wouldn&#x2019;t be all that difficult to work out how much&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;&nbsp;&#x2018;Quantify&#x2019;, that&#x2019;s the word you&#x2019;re looking for.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;d never look for ugly words like &#x2018;quantify&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A useful word, Morse. It means&#x2014;well, it means to say how much&nbsp;...&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s just what I said, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why I argue with you!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Nor did Morse.<br> &nbsp;<br> For many years now, holidays for Chief Inspector Morse of Thames Valley CID had been periods of continuous and virtually intolerable stress. And what they must normally be like for men with the extra handicaps of wives and children, even Morse for all his extravagant imagination could scarcely conceive. But for this year, for the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-two, he was resolutely determined that things would be different: he would have a holiday away from Oxford. Not abroad, though. He had no wanderlust for Xanadu or Isfahan; indeed he very seldom travelled abroad at all&#x2014;although it should be recorded that several of his colleagues attributed such insularity more than anything to Morse&#x2019;s faint-hearted fear of aeroplanes. Yet as it happened it had been one of those same colleagues who had first set things in motion.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Lime, mate! Lime&#x2019;s marvellous!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lime?<br> &nbsp;<br> Only several months later had the word finally registered in Morse&#x2019;s mind, when he had read the advertisement in The Observer:<br> &nbsp;<br> THE BAY HOTEL<br> Lyme Regis<br> &nbsp;<br> Surely one of the finest settings of any hotel in the West Country! We are the only hotel on the Marine Parade and we enjoy panoramic views from Portland Bill to the east, to the historic Cobb Harbour to the west.

I&#x2019;m with you. Saw that at the pictures with the wife&nbsp;...&nbsp;Or was it on the box?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, there we are then,&#x201d; said Morse lamely.<br> &nbsp;<br> For a while there was a silence. Then Strange shook his head.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You couldn&#x2019;t stick being away that long! Building sand-castles? For over a fortnight?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Coleridge country too, sir. I&#x2019;ll probably drive around a bit&#x2014;have a look at Ottery St. Mary&nbsp;...&nbsp;some of the old haunts.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A low chuckle emanated from somewhere deep in Strange&#x2019;s belly. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s been dead for ages, man&#x2014;more Max&#x2019;s cup o&#x2019; tea than yours.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Morse smiled wanly. &#x201c;But you wouldn&#x2019;t mind me seeing his birth-place?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s gone. The rectory&#x2019;s gone. Bulldozed years ago.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Really?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Strange puckered his lips, and nodded his head. &#x201c;You think I&#x2019;m an ignorant sod, don&#x2019;t you, Morse? But let me tell you something. There was none of this child-centred nonsense when I was at school. In those days we all had to learn things off by heart&#x2014;things like yer actual Ancient Bloody Mariner.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My days too, sir.&#x201d; It irked Morse that Strange, only a year his senior, would always treat him like a representative of some much younger generation.<br> &nbsp;<br> But Strange was in full flow.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t forget it, Morse. It sticks.&#x201d; He peered briefly but earnestly around the lumber room of some olden memories; then found what he was seeking, and with high seriousness intoned a stanza learned long since:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;All in a hot and copper sky<br> &nbsp;<br> The bloody sun at noon<br> &nbsp;<br> Right up above the mast did stand<br> &nbsp;<br> No bigger than the bloody moon!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Very good, sir,&#x201d; said Morse, uncertain whether the monstrous misquotation were deliberate or not, for he found the chief superintendent watching him shrewdly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No. You won&#x2019;t last the distance. You&#x2019;ll be back in Oxford within the week. You&#x2019;ll see!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So what? There&#x2019;s plenty for me to do here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;For a start there&#x2019;s a drain-pipe outside the flat that&#x2019;s leaking&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Strange&#x2019;s eyebrows shot up. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;re telling me you&#x2019;re going to fix that?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get it fixed,&#x201d; said Morse ambiguously. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already got a bit of extra piping but the, er, diameter of the cross-section is&nbsp;...&nbsp;rather too narrow.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too bloody small, you mean? Is that what you&#x2019;re trying to say?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Morse nodded, a little sheepishly.<br> &nbsp;<br> The score was one-all.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>M Is for Meow: A Cat Alphabet (Sleeping Bear Alphabets)</h2><p>From saber-toothed to tabby, cats have had a prominent place in human history, society, and hearts. Now cat lovers of all ages can discover what&#39;s lurking behind kitty&#39;s twitching tail and bewitching eyes in M is for Meow: A Cat Alphabet. Beginning readers enjoy the simple rhymes, while older children discover facts about each letter topic in the accompanying sidebar expository. M is for Meow Feed me, pet me, come and play. Let me out, please go away! A cat fits all these thoughts somehow into the tiny word MEOW! General topics such as breeds, behavior, and cat care alternate with charming anecdotal entries. Lavish paintings of cat and owner appeal to enthusiasts of all ages. A back section on cat stats and feline facts provides even more information for pet owners.Former librarian Helen L. Wilbur has loved cats all her life. In explaining her goal in writing an animal book for children, she says, &#34;Animals don&#39;t care if you aren&#39;t the most popular kid in the class or whether you did your homework.&#34; Helen has a BA in English Language and Literature from the University of Chicago, a master&#39;s degree in library science from Columbia University, and lives in New York City.

She lives in New York City.Grade 3-6&#x2013;Like the other titles in this series of theme-based alphabet books, this one is tough to pigeonhole. The cover, featuring a meowing ginger kitten, implies a preschool alphabet book with suitable illustrations. The pictures are indeed suitable&#x2013;gorgeous, in fact&#x2013;rendered in a style that looks uncannily photographic. But the book is jam-packed with facts and ephemera that will be beyond the grasp of an audience reading below a third-grade level. The information is not organized in any particular order, but at the whim of the alphabet itself (A is for ancestors and anatomy, T is for tail and toes, W is for whiskers). A spread of cat stats and feline facts is appended. <i>Meow</i> is worth purchasing if it is to complement the other books in the series.

When Pettson sets out to make Findus a cake, he finds that he&#39;s missing a key ingredient. This starts a hilarious chain of events resulting in Pettson distracting a bull, climbing through a skylight into his attic to find his fishing pole to fish the key out of the well, so he can open his shed, fix his flat tire, then ride to the store to buy some flour (and a new pair of overalls), then made a tasty cake for Findus!</p><p>Sven Nordqvist was born in Helsingborg, Sweden. Although he studied architecture, he always wanted to be an illustrator and found work illustrating advertisements, posters, and textbooks. In 1983 he won first prize in a children&#x2019;s book competition and since then has worked as an author and illustrator of children&#x2019;s books. He is a renowned children&#x2019;s book illustrator and writer in Sweden and across Europe. When he&#x2019;s not illustrating books for children, he spends time building playgrounds, children&#x2019;s play areas at hospitals, and decorations for schools. Carpentry has always been an important part of Nordqvist&#x2019;s life&#x2014;often reflected in the actions of his industrious character Pettson&#x2014;with the central goal being the enrichment of children&#x2019;s lives. The beloved Pettson and Findus stories draw, in part, on Nordqvist&#x2019;s loving observations of his two sons when they were younger. His unique illustrations are inspired by the delights of everyday life.PreS-Gr 3&#x2014;When children open this book, they find themselves at Pettson's charming farm, complete with a red barn, an outhouse, a woodstove, a gramophone, a chicken coop, a neighbor's contrary bull, and a talking cat named Findus. Pettson is determined to make a birthday cake out of pancakes for the feline&#x2014;one of three cakes he makes yearly for his impatient, opinionated, and sometimes lazy cat. The project is immediately derailed when the farmer realizes that he has no flour. Next, he is frustrated to discover that his bike has a flat tire, preventing him from riding to the store to buy some. The key to the shed, which contains the items needed to repair the bike, is at the bottom of the well, and the ladder to climb in through the shed skylight is being used by a mercurial bull as a pillow. Pettson's and Findus's antics to repair the bike are old-fashioned fun for kids, but downright mystifying for Pettson's neighbors, who think he is crazy. The wholesome story and quirky characters make this a great read-aloud. The illustrations may even be better than the story; Nordqvist uses saturated colors, clean lines, and a million tiny details to bring the story to life. This story was published earlier in the United States under the name Pancakes for Findus (Hawthorn, 2008).&#x2014;Sally James, South Hillsborough Elementary School, Hillsborough, CA</p><h2>The Portable North American Indian Reader (Viking Portable Library)</h2><p><i>The Portable North American Indian Reader</i> compiles myths, tales, poetry, and oratory from the Iroquois, Cherokee, Winnebago, Sioux, Blackfeet, Hopi, and many other tribes.

But long before Pantsuit Nation, before the Women&#x2019;s March, and before the #MeToo movement, women&#x2019;s anger was not only politically catalytic&#x2014;but politically problematic. The story of female fury and its cultural significance demonstrates the long history of bitter resentment that has enshrouded women&#x2019;s slow rise to political power in America, as well as the ways that anger is received when it comes from women as opposed to when it comes from men.<br> <br> With eloquence and fervor, Rebecca tracks the history of female anger as political fuel&#x2014;from suffragettes marching on the White House to office workers vacating their buildings after Clarence Thomas was confirmed to the Supreme Court. Here Traister explores women&#x2019;s anger at both men and other women; anger between ideological allies and foes; the varied ways anger is perceived based on its owner; as well as the history of caricaturing and delegitimizing female anger; and the way women&#x2019;s collective fury has become transformative political fuel&#x2014;as is most certainly occurring today. She deconstructs society&#x2019;s (and the media&#x2019;s) condemnation of female emotion (notably, rage) and the impact of their resulting repercussions.<br> <br> Highlighting a double standard perpetuated against women by all sexes, and its disastrous, stultifying effect, Traister&#x2019;s latest is timely and crucial. It offers a glimpse into the galvanizing force of women&#x2019;s collective anger, which, when harnessed, can change history.</p><p>Rebecca Traister is writer at large for&nbsp;<i>New York&nbsp;</i>magazine&nbsp;and a contributing editor at&nbsp;<i>Elle</i>.&nbsp;A National Magazine Award finalist, she has written about women in politics, media, and entertainment from a feminist perspective for&nbsp;<i>The New Republic</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Salon&nbsp;</i>and has also contributed to&nbsp;<i>The Nation</i>,&nbsp;<i>The New York Observer</i>,&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Washington Post</i>,&nbsp;<i>Vogue, Glamour</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Marie Claire</i>.

The years following the great social movements of the twentieth century&#x2014;the women&#x2019;s movement, the civil rights movement, the gay rights movement&#x2014;were shaped by deeply reactionary politics. When Phyllis Schlafly led an antifeminist crusade to stop the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment&#x2014;the twenty-four-word constitutional amendment that would have guaranteed equal rights regardless of gender&#x2014;finally succeeding in 1982, it was a sign that the second-wave feminist movement of the 1970s, and the righteous fury that had ignited it, had been sidelined.<br> <br>More broadly, the Reagan era, in which increasingly hard-right reactionary politics had joined with a religious &#x201c;moral majority,&#x201d; gave rise to a cultural backlash to all sorts of social progress. Under sharp attack were the benefits, rights, and protections that afforded poor women any stability, as well as the parts of the women&#x2019;s movement that had produced legal, professional, and educational gains for middle-class women, better enabling them to live independently, outside of marriage, the patriarchal institution that had historically contained them and on which they had long depended.<br> <br>The right wing of the 1980s was driven to restrict abortion access and deregulate Wall Street while simultaneously destroying the social safety net, which Ronald Reagan had made sure was embodied by the specter of the black welfare queen. A 1986 Newsweek cover story, meanwhile, blared the news that a single woman at forty was more likely to get killed by a terrorist than get married. That later-debunked study was a key point of Susan Faludi&#x2019;s chronicle of the era, Backlash, in which she tracked the varied, suffocating ways in which women&#x2019;s anger was muffled throughout the Reagan years: how feminist activism was blamed for the purported &#x201c;man shortage&#x201d;; the day-care that enabled women to work outside the home vilified as dangerous for children.<br> <br>Popular culture showed liberated white career women as oversexed monsters, as in Fatal Attraction, or as cold, shoulder-padded harpies who had to be saved via hetero-union or punished via romantic rejection (see Diane Keaton in Baby Boom, Sigourney Weaver in Working Girl). There was far too little space afforded to black heroines, and even some of the most nuanced were often crafted to serve male creators&#x2019; investments in how women&#x2019;s liberation might serve their messages: Spike Lee&#x2019;s view of the sexually voracious Nola Darling in the 1986 film She&#x2019;s Gotta Have It and Bill Cosby&#x2019;s Clair Huxtable, the successful matriarch who, given the context of Cosby&#x2019;s own racial politics, served as a repudiation of black women who were not wealthy hetero-married mothers with law degrees.<br> <br>Who wanted to be a feminist? No one. And the anxiety about the term wasn&#x2019;t about any of the good reasons to be skeptical of feminism&#x2014;like the movement&#x2019;s racial exclusions and elisions&#x2014;but because the term itself, the idea of public and politicized challenge to male dominance, had been successfully coded as unattractively old, as crazy, as ugly. Susan Sarandon, the rare celebrity who actually maintained her publicly left politics through the 1980s and 90s, once explained why even she of the unrelenting commitment to disruptive political speech preferred the misnomer &#x201c;humanist&#x201d; to calling herself a &#x201c;feminist&#x201d;: &#x201c;it&#x2019;s less alienating to people who think of feminism as being a load of strident bitches.&#x201d;1<br> <br>To be sure, there were eruptions of fury, coming from people&#x2014;often from women&#x2014;who were waging battles against inequities. In 1991, the law professor Anita Hill testified in front of an all-white, all-male Senate Judiciary Committee that Clarence Thomas, her former boss at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, then a nominee for the Supreme Court, had sexually harassed her. Many women were taken aback by the way the committee insulted, dismissed, and ultimately disbelieved Hill, confirming Thomas to the court, where he sits today.<br> <br>&#x201c;It was so stark, watching these men grill this woman in these big chairs and looking down at her,&#x201d; Patty Murray, senator from Washington state, has recalled. Murray and a lot of other women were so outraged by the treatment of Hill that an unprecedented number of them ran for office in 1992. Four, including Murray, won Senate seats; one of them, Carol Moseley Braun, became the first-ever African-American woman elected to the Senate. Twenty-four women were elected to the House of Representatives for the first time, more than had been elected in any other previous decade.<br> <br>These years sometimes included violent rage in response to racism: in 1992, after four white cops were acquitted by a mostly white jury in the brutal beating of African-American taxi driver Rodney King in Los Angeles, the city erupted in fury. Angry protesters looted stores and set fires; sixty-three people died. At the time, the news media and local politicians were quick to describe the events as riots, throwing around the term &#x201c;thugs.&#x201d;<br> <br>But one Los Angeles Democratic representative saw something else in the riots: &#x201c;There are those who would like for me . . . to tell people to go inside, to be peaceful, that they have to accept the verdict. I accept the responsibility of asking people not to endanger their lives. I am not asking people not to be angry,&#x201d; said first-term congresswoman Maxine Waters, who represented a big part of the South Central Los Angeles neighborhood where much of the unrest was unfolding. &#x201c;I am angry and I have a right to that anger and the people out there have a right to that anger.&#x201d;2<br> <br>Waters spent days tending to her constituents, bringing food, water, and diapers to Angelenos living without gas or electricity; she also pushed to charge the police officers civilly, and objected to Mayor Tom Bradley&#x2019;s use of the word &#x201c;riot&#x201d; to describe events. Instead, she saw the politically rational frame for the resentments being expressed, calling it &#x201c;an insurrection.&#x201d;3<br> <br>Eventually, Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates was fired, and two of the police officers were convicted for violating Rodney King&#x2019;s civil rights.4<br> <br>There were other moments of political protest: those against the World Trade Organization in Seattle in 1999 and marches against the invasion of Iraq in 2003, for example. But much of the spirit of mass, brash, sustained political fury that had animated the 1960s and 1970s was muffled in the 1980s and stayed that way for decades.<br> <br>The journalist Mychal Denzel Smith has written of how this suppression worked itself out around expressions of black rage in the years in which he&#x2019;d grown up, noting that during most of the 1990s, &#x201c;there was no longer a Reagan or a Bush to serve as an identifiable enemy,&#x201d; and that a pop commitment to &#x201c;multiculturalism&#x201d; permitted the illusion that racial progress had been achieved, so rage as a mass impulse had subsided.5<br> <br>There had been a brief revival during the second Bush administration, Smith argued, recalling how, in the wake of the derelict response to Hurricane Katrina, rapper Kanye West had yelled that George W. Bush &#x201c;doesn&#x2019;t care about black people.&#x201d; But that surge of fury had been quieted by the presidential campaign of Barack Obama. Obama&#x2019;s historic drive had relied in part on his ability to reassure white voters that he was not an angry black man, that he was cut from a different cloth than some of his more bellicose black predecessors, including Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, and did not in his demeanor threaten white supremacy. But Obama&#x2019;s reputation for cordiality was gravely imperiled by the appearance of old-style black rage, when Reverend Jeremiah Wright, the man who had married the Obamas, became a campaign story, along with his much-played sermon, during which he&#x2019;d exhorted, &#x201c;God damn America!&#x201d; The specter of Wright&#x2019;s version of confrontational blackness was enough to remind America of Obama&#x2019;s outsider status, and thus Obama was forced to quash it, becoming, in Smith&#x2019;s words, &#x201c;the first viable black presidential candidate to throw water on the flames of black rage.&#x201d; The anger expressed by Wright, Obama would say in his famous speech on race, &#x201c;is not always productive; indeed, all too often it distracts attention from solving real problems.&#x201d;<br> <br>But partway through the Obama administration, some political fury had begun to bubble over and break through this veneer of calm, in part driven by, or in ways that meaningfully sidelined, the angry voices of women.<br> ANGER RIGHT AND LEFT<p></p> <br>Perhaps the most politically effective strike came from the right, with the Tea Party protests that began in 2009, soon after President Barack Obama took office. In response to Obama&#x2019;s plan to bail out some homeowners who&#x2019;d been caught in the housing crisis, cable news reporter Rick Santelli angrily called on television for the &#x201c;Tea Party&#x201d; to object. The reference, of course, was to the 1773 revolutionary protest of colonists who threw tea in Boston Harbor to register their objection to being taxed by Britain, which was using tariffs not to support the colonies but to stabilize its own floundering economy, and had imposed them on colonists who had no representation in British Parliament.6<br> <br>The contemporary version was portrayed as a leaderless grassroots movement, though almost from its start, right-wing mega donors the Koch brothers had been funding its protests and its candidates. In theory, the agitation was in response to the far right&#x2019;s view that Barack Obama&#x2019;s administration was misusing taxpayer money, but the Tea Party was also driven by a wave of revanchist rage and racial resentment toward Barack Obama; no amount of nonconfrontational rhetoric could convince overwhelmingly white Tea Partiers he wasn&#x2019;t a threat to their status and supremacy.<br> <br>Though the public face of the Tea Party protesters was that of furious white men&#x2014;often dressed in colonial-era tricorn hats in their early gatherings&#x2014;some polls indicated that the majority of the faction&#x2019;s supporters were women. Its most audible early female voice belonged to former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who in one address to activists called the movement &#x201c;another revolution.&#x201d; In 2010, a number of Tea Party&#x2013;affiliated female candidates ran; Palin, who&#x2019;d cast herself as a pit-bullish hockey mom, dubbed them &#x201c;Mama Grizzlies.&#x201d; And while the movement&#x2019;s theatrics&#x2014;funny hats and grizzly bears&#x2014;were reminiscent of some of the performative exertions of the Second Wave, its mission was the precise opposite, more of a callback to the Schlafly-led antifeminist crusades of the 1970s and 80s.<br> <br>Somehow, as with Schlafly, these women voicing their anger and throwing around their political weight weren&#x2019;t caricatured as ugly hysterics; instead they were permitted to cast themselves as patriotic moms on steroids, some bizarro-world embodiment of female empowerment, despite the fact (or, more precisely, because of the fact) that what they were advocating was a return to traditionalist roles for women and reduced government investment in nonwhite people. Once they landed in the United States Congress, their obsessive mission was to vote to take away the federal funding received by family planning programs, to outlaw abortion, to punish Planned Parenthood, and to reduce government safety net programs such as food stamps and what remained of welfare.<br> <br>&#x201c;Conservative women have found their voices and are using them, actively and loudly,&#x201d; Tea Partier Rebecca Wales told Politico in 2010. Another Tea Partier, Darla Dawald, put it this way: &#x201c;You know the old saying &#x2018;If Mama ain&#x2019;t happy, ain&#x2019;t nobody happy&#x2019;? When legislation messes with Mama&#x2019;s kids and it affects her family, then Mama comes out fighting&#x2014;and I don&#x2019;t mean in a violent way, of course.&#x201d;7<br> <br>As more moderate Republicans got knocked out of their seats by Tea Party candidates, and those who remained moved further right, an angry protest in New York was drawing crowds of agitators from the other side. In the fall of 2011, in Zuccotti Park in downtown Manhattan, young people gathered to voice their fury at economic inequality, the widening gap between rich and poor, the rampant deregulation of and tax breaks for corporate America and Wall Street, and the steady gutting of social welfare programs.<br> <br>Occupy Wall Street&#x2019;s impact on the American left was crucial and long-lasting; the movement helped to popularize the view of economic inequality that set the 99 percent against the nation&#x2019;s richest 1 percent. It was both a symptom and a fomenter of increased interest in socialist economic policy. That interest would help push the Democratic Party&#x2014;which had for decades run screaming from the notion of even &#x201c;liberalism&#x201d;&#x2014;further left, boosting the profiles and fortunes of politicians including Elizabeth Warren, who was elected Senator for Massachusetts in 2012, and Bernie Sanders, an independent who&#x2019;d served in Congress for twenty-six years and would mount an electrifying campaign for the presidency in 2016.<br> <br>Many different types of people participated in Occupy&#x2014;estimates varied, but reportedly around 40 percent of the protesters were women, and 37 percent identified as nonwhite, making it far closer to representative of the United States than, say, Congress.8&#x2013;10 Yet despite the fact that its structure was consciously collaborative and nonhierarchical, it was nevertheless a movement dominated publicly by the voices and ideas of white men. There were enough allegations of rape, groping, and sexual assault at Zuccotti Park that after several weeks, women-only tents were set up. Kanene Holder, an artist, activist, and black woman who served as one of Occupy&#x2019;s spokespeople, told the Guardian that even within this progressive space, &#x201c;white males are used to speaking and running things. . . . You can&#x2019;t expect them to abdicate the power they have just because they are in this movement.&#x201d; Eventually, Occupy had to adopt special sessions in which women were encouraged to speak uninterrupted.11<br> <br>More than that, some of the righteously radical men who dominated Occupy were reportedly inhospitable to internal feminist critique. As one activist, Ren Jender, wrote after a proposal to better address sexual assault allegations was met with defensive anger from some of these radically progressive men, &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t angry with only the people who . . . said stupid, misogynistic shit . . . I was angry with the greater number of people who hadn&#x2019;t confronted the misogyny.&#x201d;12 Occupy was a reminder to many who agreed with its principles that the left was no more free of gender hierarchies and power abuses than the rest of the country.<br> <br>Then, in 2013, in the wake of the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the murder of seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin, the longtime progressive activist Alicia Garza wrote a note on Facebook, which concluded with the sentences, &#x201c;Black people, I love you. I love us. We matter. Our lives matter.&#x201d; The artist and activist Patrisse Khan-Cullors appended a hashtag to it, #BlackLivesMatter; the writer and community organizer Opal Tometi helped to push the message out over social media.<br> <br>A movement&#x2014;born of grief, horror, and unleashed fury at the persistent killing of African Americans by the state, by the police&#x2014;was born. And while it, like Occupy and the Tea Party, was purposefully nonhierarchical in its internal structure, it had been founded by women, and many of the most prominent voices of the movement belonged to women, ...</p><h2>Rediscovering the Integral Cosmos: Physics, Metaphysics, and Vertical Causality</h2><p><p>When a physicist who becomes a metaphysician, and a metaphysician who studies physics, join together to deal philosophically with science (quantum physics and cosmogenesis in particular), explosive results might well be expected&#x2014;and this pivotal text does not disappoint. Co-author Jean Borella, professor of philosophy and metaphysics, also earned a degree in physics. And in co-author Wolfgang Smith we have a professor of mathematics and physics who became a metaphysician.</p> <p>Smith explores the implications of what he terms &#x201c;vertical causality,&#x201d; a hitherto unrecognized mode of causation which proves to be the missing ingredient needed to make sense out of quantum physics. He explains how vertical causality brings to light the long-forgotten fact that the integral cosmos replicates the <i>corpus/anima/spiritus</i> constitution of man; and, moreover, that this cosmic trichotomy proves essential both to a recovery of traditional cosmology and to the advancement of contemporary science. Finally, he shows on scriptural grounds that the trichotomous cosmology accords with the teachings of Christ. Still, it was necessary for philosophy to try to explain how and why science became atheistic in the first place; and this is just what Jean Borella has undertaken in his contribution: &#x201c;Is Science Through with God?&#x201d; Whether we follow Borella or Smith, we return to a Weltanschauung that can finally account for the world in all its dimensions, and, especially, find its meaning&#x2014;a meaning weakened by several centuries of mechanical determinism.</p></p><p><p><b>JEAN BORELLA</b> (1930&#x2013;) has taught metaphysics and the history of ancient and medieval philosophy at the University of Nancy.

Now, in <i>The Lyme Solution</i>, Dr. Darin Ingels shares his revolutionary approach to treating and healing acute and chronic Lyme. Drawing on his experience as a naturopathic physician who has treated thousands of cases, and as a patient, Ingels reveals that Lyme is an autoimmune disease as much as it is an infection. Conventional treatments too often rely on toxic doses of antibiotics that weaken your body and worsen symptoms, instead of boosting your ability to fight for your health. Including the latest research about the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme, Ingels's uniquely holistic approach provides a path to wellness by fortifying the microbiome, enhancing the immune system, and strengthening the body's ability to heal from within. <i>The Lyme Solution</i> offers a simple, five-step plan, including:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>*</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;the most effective early treatment and prevention measures to avoid contracting the disease or stop it in its tracks;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>*</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;an Immune Boosting Diet and list of herbal supplements that will increase immunity and reduce inflammation;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>*</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;guidelines for when and how to use antibiotics as an effective part of your treatment plan;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>*</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;tools to identify and eliminate conditions that mimic Lyme disease or exacerbate your symptoms.<br><br>Whether you are facing acute or chronic Lyme, or undiagnosed autoimmune symptoms, the natural, whole-body approach of <i>The Lyme Solution</i> will help you permanently recover your health, and reclaim your life.</p><p><b>Darin Ingels, ND,FAAEM,</b> is a respected leader in natural medicine with numerous publications, international lectures, and more than twenty-six years of experience in the healthcare field. He received his bachelor of science degree in medical technology from Purdue University and his doctorate of Naturopathic Medicine from Bastyr University. He has worked as a clinical microbiologist/immunologist at Lutheran General Hospital, and is board-certified in Integrative Pediatrics. He is also one of the first Naturopathic Physicians to receive a Fellowship with the American Academy of Environmental Medicine. His practice focuses on chronic immune disorders, including Lyme disease, autism, allergies, asthma, recurrent or persistent infections, and other immune problems. Dr. Ingels uses diet, nutrients, herbs, homeopathy, and immunotherapy to help his patients achieve better health.In the complex world of Lyme, many people believe there is at least one certainty. If nothing else, you can rely on that well-known sign that you have been bitten by a Lyme tick&#x2014;the telltale bull&#x2019;s-eye rash, the red ring that develops around the bite. <br><br> Or can you? <br><br> The bull&#x2019;s-eye rash is reliable proof that you have been bitten by a Lyme tick, but some individuals with Lyme develop a different kind of rash, or none at all. The CDC states that 70 to 80 percent of people with Lyme disease get the bull&#x2019;s-eye rash.1 However, other experts in the field feel this number is grossly exaggerated and that the rash may only be seen in up to 50 percent of people who get Lyme disease.2 Joint swelling, another sign of Lyme disease, is not a reliable gauge either, since it is found in only about 30 percent of people.3 The fact is, people in early-stage Lyme experience a wide variety of symptoms. <br><br> Lyme may present itself as a flu-like illness. You may get fever, chills, sweats, and muscle aches. Or you may feel fatigue. Other than the bull&#x2019;s-eye rash, there is no single, unmistakable sign that you have Lyme bacteria in your system at this early stage. <br><br> <b>JOHN&#x2019;S STORY </b><br> When John came to my clinic, he told me that he had had chronic arthritis and significant back pain for more than twenty years. He also complained of chronic fatigue, muscle pain, and head- aches. John had been to more than a dozen doctors and special- ists and had been diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. To help relieve his symptoms, his doctors pre- scribed multiple painkillers and muscle relaxants. But while these&nbsp;drugs helped somewhat to control his pain, their many side ef- fects interfered with his daily life and work. When I began work- ing with John, his blood tests for autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus were all negative. The only tests that repeatedly came back positive were the ones for inflamma- tory markers&#x2014;these were always elevated.&nbsp;<br>I asked John if he had ever been tested for Lyme disease. He told me that because he had been living in Florida, where there is no known Lyme disease, his doctors told him he didn&#x2019;t need to test for Lyme. But his doctors neglected to ask him where he grew up, which happened to be Connecticut&#x2014;a state with one of the highest rates of infection from Lyme disease! <br><br> I recommended he get a Lyme screen test through his local reference laboratory, A widely available test, and the one most doctors offer first, this test looks for specific Lyme antibodies. In John&#x2019;s case, the results were negative. However, as I well knew from my work as a microbiologist in a clinical laboratory (before I became a physician), this test often produces false negatives. A false negative means that the person has the disorder but the test reports that they don&#x2019;t. Knowing that is a common result with this particular test, I decided to run a more sensitive and specific antibody test called a Lyme Western blot. The guideline from the CDC is to first run the screening test. I often don&#x2019;t run the screening test because it is so faulty, but since it&#x2019;s the CDC pro- tocol, many doctors offer this test. Later, I will discuss this issue in greater depth. <br><br> When I ran the more accurate Western blot, John&#x2019;s results came back positive. My suspicions had been confirmed: John was very likely exposed to a tick bite and infected with Lyme disease when he was living in Connecticut and had never been properly&nbsp;diagnosed. Once I knew what was causing his symptoms, he started the same treatment you will follow in this book. Within six weeks, almost all of his symptoms had resolved. It has now been almost two years since his diagnosis. I am happy to report that John is living symptom-free.&nbsp;<br><i>The Great Imitator </i><br> John&#x2019;s case clearly shows why Lyme disease has become so problematic: many who are infected are never diagnosed. Many others are diag- nosed incorrectly. In fact, I refer to Lyme disease as &#x201c;the Great Imita- tor,&#x201d; since it can look like many other illnesses. This often tempts health-care providers to look for other diseases, when the problem is actually Lyme. I am always saddened to hear about a person who has complained for years of Lyme-like symptoms but has gone untested because their doctor felt it was unnecessary. This oversight is bad enough if the patient lives in an area where Lyme disease is uncommon. But when it happens where Lyme disease is epidemic, it&#x2019;s alarming. <br><br> To make matters worse, doctors receive little education on Lyme disease in medical school. It is only when physicians get into clinical practice and start seeing Lyme in all of its various manifestations that they begin to understand it. This is why, when you consult a doctor, you must be your own best advocate. If your doctor or health-care provider resists testing you, then find someone who will. Every practi- tioner who treats Lyme disease knows that the sooner you start treat- ment, the better your chances of recovery.

Playful, erotic, at times mysterious, his work describes the immanent value of everyday experience. Straightforward language and simple narratives become gateways to the most powerful formulations of beauty, wisdom, and divine love.</p><p>Li-Young Lee was born in 1957 in Jakarta, Indonesia. His verse has earned numerous honors, including a Lannan Literary Award, a Paterson Poetry Prize, and an American Book Award. Lee lives in Chicago with his wife and two sons.Starred Review. In this fourth collection by the popular Lee (<i>Book of My Nights</i>), timely immigration issues drive such poems as Self-Help for Fellow Refugees, but Lee swiftly folds them into broader inquiries about inheritance, memory and loss: you'll remember your life, he advises, as a book of candles,/ each page read by the light of its own burning. Lee's late father appears in the light of his evangelical Christian beliefs, his mother and sister as cherished links to childhood. Biblical allusions enliven an otherwise spare verbal world, while aphorisms and spiritual advice strike a note reminiscent of Rumi: Every wise child is sad.... Every wind-strewn flower is God tearing God. Rarely subtle, Lee can nevertheless be concise: every line bears the weight of long meditation, sometimes even of wisdom. Virtues of the Boring Husband, the longest piece, is one of Lee's best: a discourse on the nature of love&#x2014;ponderous but shot through with golden truths&#x2014;that comes from the mouth of the sheepish partner who admits, Whenever I talk, my wife falls asleep./ So now, when she can't sleep, I talk. Lee's ringing clarity and his compelling life story have brought him uncommonly loyal readers: this volume should swell their ranks. A CD of Lee reading many of the poems is included. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Dissolute noblemen like Ainswood are part of the problem, not the solution. She would like him to get his big, gorgeous carcass out of her way so that she can carry on with her work. The problem is, Ainswood can no more resist a challenge, especially in female form, than he can resist the trouble she seems to attract. </p><p><strong>If they can only weather their personal firestorm...</strong><br>they might survive the real danger that threatens all they hold dear.</p></p><p>In 1820s England, 28-year-old Lydia Grenville is a few inches under six feet tall and mind-numbingly beautiful. Clever as well as gorgeous, she is the author of a London newspaper's most popular adventure serial and has also penned scathing articles about the prostitution trade in the city. Her less-than-ladylike occupation, checkered past, and questionable lineage make it highly unlikely that she will ever marry a member of the Regency <i>ton</i>. However, in keeping with a long legacy of hell-raising ancestors, Vere Mallory, the notorious Duke of Ainswood, has a reputation for flaunting society's dictates. Besides, one look at Lydia and he loses his heart, although at the time, it doesn't occur to him that love is what he feels. He terms it lust and sets out to bed the beautiful Lydia. <p> What follows is an endearing, hilarious contest of wills between a woman determined to hold her heart and body safe, and a man just as determined to conquer her. In a final, winner-takes-all contest, Lydia and Vere come to terms, but neither is sure just who won and just who lost the wager. Is it possible they may both come out winners? Meanwhile, Lydia's very public crusade against the worst offenders in the city's illegal prostitution business has earned her dangerous enemies. Just when it seems that Vere and Lydia may resolve their personal contest of wills, the dark forces at work in the seamier side of London threaten not only Lydia, but also Vere's beloved nieces. </p><p> <i>The Last Hellion</i> has a cast of well-drawn characters who play out their scenes against a backdrop of Regency England that's both lushly rich in descriptions of the wealthy and darkly gritty when traveling the back streets where poverty rules.</p><p>Loretta Chase has worked in academe, retail, and the visual arts, as well as on the streets&#x2014;as a meter maid&#x2014;and in video, as a scriptwriter.

In this collection of short mysteries, Tremayne fills in many of the background details of Fidelma and seventh-century Ireland not found in the novels, and weaves his always-beguiling mix of history and mystery.</p></p><p>PETER TREMAYNE is a pseudonym of Peter Berresford Ellis, a renowned scholar who has written extensively on the ancient Celts and the Irish. As Tremayne, he is best known for mysteries of Ancient Ireland featuring Sister Fidelma of Cashel, beginning with <i>Absolution by Murder</i>. He lives in London.Fifteen more times in these Sister Fidelma stories, Tremayne's Celtic sleuth hits the road and sorts out crime in seventh- century Ireland. Does the peripatetic investigator ever go home? Never, in six published novels; once, in the title story of a collection that takes her from apprenticeship as a Brehon advocate through disillusionment with her House of Blessed Brigid to worldly fame as the King's smart sister. Newcomers to the series (Valley of the Shadow, Mar. 2000) will be fascinated by a utopian presentation of unfamiliar social and religious history. Fans will learn little new about either Fidelma or her Ireland and may groan over repeated descriptive epithetsfrom her urchin grin to strands of her rebellious red hairbut theyll also be amazed by how the short form forces Tremayne to economize on detail and prune subplots. While too many clues are clumsy (``Holy Blood''), marring otherwise clever plotting (``The Horse That Died for Shame''), and too much talk (``Tarnished Halo'') has to compensate for too little character development (``A Canticle for Wulfstan''), the best stories economically evoke Fidelmas world as they illustrate her creators debts to Agatha Christiefor example, in the twisted ends of ``Invitation to a Poisoning'' and ``At the Tent of Holofernes.'' The latter, the best in the collection, dramatizes a complex mesh of betrayals that also catch up the sleuth, exploiting both Fidelma's strengths and vulnerabilities. More predictable than experimental, with the mechanical elements diluting some genuine pleasures. Still, Fidelmas fans will welcome this first-ever collection, many stories of which are appearing here for the first time. -- <i>Copyright �2000, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Drawing on nearly five decades of research as well as forty-five years working as a psychoanalyst, Nathan Schwartz-Salant explains that, in a world where vast amounts of order are being created through the growing success of science and technology, the concomitant disorder is having devastating effects upon relationships, society, and the environment.&nbsp;As a Jungian analyst with training in the physical sciences, Schwartz-Salant is uniquely qualified to explore scientific conceptions of energy, information, and entropy alongside their mythical antecedents.&nbsp;He analyzes the possible effects of created disorder, including its negative consequences for the creator of the preceding order as well as its potentially transformative functions. With many examples of the interaction of order and disorder in everyday life and psychotherapy,&nbsp;<i>The Order-Disorder Paradox&nbsp;</i>makes&nbsp;new inroads into our understanding of the wide-ranging consequences of the order we create and its effects on others and the environment.</p><p>Trained in Jungian psychology at the C. G. Jung Institute in Zu&#x308;rich, Switzerland, Nathan Schwartz-Salant has been a psychoanalyst in private practice since 1968. He is the author of several books on Jungian analysis, including <i>Narcissism and Character Transformation</i> and <i>The Mystery of Human Relationship: Alchemy and the Transformation of the Self.</i>&#x201c;This brilliant, wise, and profound book is a masterwork by one of the world&#x2019;s leading psychologists. Drawing on a vast array of sources and a lifetime&#x2019;s experience, Nathan Schwartz-Salant reveals a great truth hidden at the heart of the world&#x2019;s authentic mystical traditions: that all new order also creates disorder. This extraordinary work is a must-read for all those who want to understand the rhythms of life and the meanings of our contemporary chaos.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Andrew Harvey, author of <i>The Hope: A Guide to Sacred Activism</i> <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>The Order-Disorder Paradox</i> is the result of five decades of devoted investigation in the domains of mathematics, engineering, psychology, and mysticism. It is not only a cogent, elegant, and highly original theory but also an eminently practical way to understand the seemingly unpredictable oscillations of psychological healing and personal transformation. This book calls for powerful and immediate shifts in how we approach the clinical encounter as well as the life of the soul.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Lorie Eve Dechar, author of&nbsp;<i>Five Spirits: Alchemical Acupuncture for Psychological and Spiritual Healing</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Schwartz-Salant offers a far-reaching and profound exploration of the dialectical interplay between order and disorder. Moving beyond the contemporary rationalist worldview that seeks to repress disorder in favor of order, he points us to a trans-rational alternative well suited to our tumultuous times&#x2014;an alternative that, in harking back to our pre-rational origins in myth, does not merely regress to those origins but carries us forward into new territory. <i>The Order-Disorder Paradox</i> is a highly significant, compelling work that deserves the rapt attention of theorists, psychoanalysts, and laypeople alike.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Steven Rosen, Emeritus Professor of Psychology, College of Staten Island, City University of New York; author of <i>Dreams, Death, Rebirth&nbsp;</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This long-awaited book comes at just the right time&#x2014;not only for psychotherapists, who will benefit greatly from its clinical insights, but also for scholars of politics and culture.

Now, in Twilight of the Belle Epoque, McAuliffe portrays Paris in full flower at the turn of the twentieth century, where creative dynamos such as Picasso, Matisse, Stravinsky, Debussy, Ravel, Proust, Marie Curie, Gertrude Stein, Jean Cocteau, and Isadora Duncan set their respective circles on fire with a barrage of revolutionary visions and discoveries. Such dramatic breakthroughs were not limited to the arts or sciences, as innovators and entrepreneurs such as Louis Renault, Andr� Citro�n, Paul Poiret, Fran�ois Coty, and so many others&#x2014;including those magnificent men and women in their flying machines&#x2014;emphatically demonstrated. But all was not well in this world, remembered in hindsight as a golden age, and wrenching struggles between Church and state as well as between haves and have-nots shadowed these years, underscored by the ever-more-ominous drumbeat of the approaching Great War&#x2014;a cataclysm that would test the mettle of the City of Light, even as it brutally brought the Belle Epoque to its close. Through rich illustrations and evocative narrative, McAuliffe brings this remarkable era from 1900 through World War I to vibrant life.</p><p>Mary McAuliffe holds a PhD in history from the University of Maryland, has taught at several universities, and has lectured at the Smithsonian Institution. She has traveled extensively in France, and for many years she was a regular contributor to Paris Notes. Her books include Paris Discovered, Dawn of the Belle Epoque, and Clash of Crowns. She lives in New York City with her husband.McAuliffe completes her chronicle of Paris&#x2013;begun with Dawn of the Belle Epoque&#x2013;with this volume, similar in scope and content to her initial offering. Paris serves as the essential backdrop for a year-by-year summary of the lives, loves, and achievements of the city's academic and cultural elite. The author has a keen eye for the telling, tantalizing, and occasionally titillating detail, and she has mined a host of solid secondary works as well as printed journals and memoirs to assemble this portrait. Casual readers will be astonished at the book's dramatis personae: not only Picasso, Stravinsky, Proust, Renault, the Curies, and Gertrude Stein&#x2013;&#x2013;all name-dropped on the cover&#x2013;&#x2013;but also Clemenceau, Rodin, Bernhardt, Duncan, Zola, Debussy, and Matisse. All told, an astonishing outpouring of artistic ability and achievement. Scholars will find a wealth of detail that brings to life the figures of tout Paris. Like its companion volume, this second 'gossipy souffl�' will charm all who love Paris, French history, and the arts. It would make a wonderful travel companion for those Paris bound, and a delightful read for all. Summing Up: Highly recommended. All 20th-century collections. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>In Twilight of the Belle Epoque, this brilliant social historian applies her novelistic approach . . . to the early 20th century, interweaving a multitude of stories to create&#x2014;through skillfully chosen glimpses into the lives of its most talented inhabitants&#x2014;an unforgettable portrait of Paris. . . . Deftly, McAuliffe gathers together the threads of her multiple tales for the arrival of that ultimate rite: war. Here, to her readers&#x2019; possible surprise, the artists and inventors emerge as heroes. . . . Summary reduces the various elements of McAuliffe&#x2019;s marvelous book to a mere cocktail of events. Harder to convey is the subtlety of the mix. With uncommon skill, she blends each ingredient of an incredible �poque into a vivid and hugely enjoyable narrative of extraordinary times. (<i>The New York Times</i>)<br><br>However tentative its beginning and disastrous its end, the Third Republic had its glories, as Mary McAuliffe reminds us in Twilight of the Belle Epoque. The years between 1870 and 1914 were a time when Paris could fairly claim to be the cultural capital of the world. This was the France of the Impressionists and post-Impressionists, of Rodin and the young Picasso, Matisse and Braque, the France of Proust and Gide, of Debussy and Ravel. Paris became the City of Light, the center of fashion. The cinema was born; the M�tro was built. The Renault brothers and Andr� Citro�n created an automobile industry. Pierre and Marie Curie, discovering the properties of radium, prepared the way for advances that transformed the modern world.<br><br>In her panoramic chronicle, Ms. McAuliffe takes up all these topics, giving a year-by-year account of the second half of the era, just as she treated its first half in Dawn of the Belle Epoque (2011). Her strict chronological format creates a series of surprising juxtapositions: On one page, a young Charles de Gaulle marvels at a performance by Sarah Bernhardt ; on the next, Picasso walks around Paris wielding a gun passed down by the avant-garde troublemaker Alfred Jarry. This is a work of serious history, but has some of the easy charms of the coffee-table book and is full of gossip. (When Bernhardt's anti-Dreyfus son offends her during dinner, she angrily shatters a plate.) . . . All of Ms. McAuliffe's Belle Epoque moments, bright and foreboding, build to the horrors and glories of the war of 1914-18, in which France suffered losses of almost 1.5 million men, with some three million more wounded. (<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>Fascinating trivia about artists in turn-of-the-century Paris adds layers of insight to a time of growth and experimentation...McAuliffe is uniquely positioned to bring this crowded cast of characters to life. She does a thorough job of cataloging the wide range of artistic and scientific achievements while managing to also offer surprising tidbits that add texture to the narrative...McAuliffe&#x2019;s knowledge of and enthusiasm for this time is evident on every page. (<i>Foreword Reviews</i>)<br><br>In her prior work, Dawn of the Belle Epoque (2011), historian McAuliffe recounted how Paris, reeling from the disasters of the Franco-Prussian War and the Paris Commune, reemerged as the glittering cultural center of Europe in the last two decades of the nineteenth century. During the so-called Belle Epoque, art, literature, and science bloomed in a creative outburst, led by a cast of innovative geniuses, including Zola, Monet, Rodin, and Renoir. In her follow-up, McAuliffe covers the period from 1900 to 1914. The cast of characters as well as the political and social milieu have changed somewhat, but the cultural, scientific, and technological creativity continued to flourish. But as McAuliffe indicates, the epoch had its dark side, including the ongoing and increasingly vicious battles between monarchists and republicans, and Catholics versus secularists. The more prescient observers were haunted by the looming threat of a general European war. This is a fine tribute to an amazingly productive period in Parisian and world history. (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>McAuliffe follows up her Dawn of the Belle Epoque: The Paris of Monet, Zola, Bernhardt, Eiffel, Debussy, Clemenceau, and Their Friends with this book taking readers forward a few decades. It&#x2019;s actually not so much a history of a time as a collection of biographies&#x2014;over 30 of them&#x2014;of early 20th-century French inventors, politicians, and artists. The author divides the book by year, with each chapter relating significant events in the life of the main subjects during that one year. . . . McAuliffe has an eye for the evocative, using quotes&#x2014;and salacious details&#x2014;to bring these early 20th-century men and women to life, several of whom&#x2014;Rodin, Zola, the Curies&#x2014;were covered in her previous book (she orients readers in case they did not read that volume). The author excels at including material about women throughout. VERDICT Recommended for readers who enjoyed the previous volume and for biography junkies. (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>A sequel to her Dawn of the Belle Epoque, which took readers from the Franco-Prussian war to the 1900 Universal Exposition, McAuliffe&#x2019;s Twilight introduces a new cast of characters. Picasso, Stravinsky, Proust, Marie Curie, and Gertrude Stein are just a few of the creative dynamos who appear in the pages of this new volume&#x2014;a lively account of an era of literary, artistic, and technical innovation that ended with the world-altering tragedy of WWI. (<i>France Magazine</i>)<br><br>McAuliffe revisits this vibrant, controversial era and weaves brief chronological snapshots of the eponymous figures&#x2014;plus others like Sarah Bernhardt and �mile Zola&#x2014;and their (often long-suffering) companions throughout her . . . eminently readable . . . narrative. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>From 1900 through the beginning of World War I, Paris was the place to be if you were an artist, author, musician, scientist, or trendsetter of any kind. Some of the most famous names that helped shape history flocked to share ideas, garner support for their cause, or simply to soak up all that creativity. In the book Twilight of the Belle Epoque, author Mary McAuliffe follows up on her first book Dawn of the Belle Epoque to take readers back to this illustrious age and shows how the looming threat of violence in Europe brought an end to one of the most creative periods in history. (<i>Quincy Herald-Whig</i>)<br><br>With Twilight of the Belle Epoque Mary McAuliffe offers a delightful romp through one of the most vibrant periods in French history, even as she elegantly captures the shadows looming on the horizon. Those unfamiliar with this period will be awestruck by its riches, while connoisseurs will delight as McAuliffe brings to life the colorful cast of artists and innovators&#x2014;from Picasso to Peugeot&#x2014;who ushered in the twentieth century in the City of Light.

Just the baby, and some dining room chairs, and the tip of a ship disappearing into the ocean. There had been music in the dining hall, and it was music so loud and so good that nobody had noticed the water flooding in over the carpet. The violins went on sawing for some time after the screaming had begun. Sometimes the shriek of a passenger would duet with a high C.<br> <br>The baby was found wrapped for warmth in the musical score of a Beethoven symphony. It had drifted almost a mile from the ship, and was the last to be rescued. The man who lifted it into the rescue boat was a fellow passenger, and a scholar. It is a scholar&#x2019;s job to notice things. He noticed that it was a girl, with hair the color of lightning, and the smile of a shy person.<br> <br>Think of nighttime with a speaking voice. Or think how moonlight might talk, or think of ink, if ink had vocal cords. Give those things a narrow aristocratic face with hooked eyebrows, and long arms and legs, and that is what the baby saw as she was lifted out of her cello case and up into safety. His name was Charles Maxim, and he determined, as he held her in his large hands&#x2014;at arm&#x2019;s length, as he would a leaky flowerpot&#x2014;that he would keep her.<br> <br>The baby was almost certainly one year old. They knew this because of the red rosette pinned to her front, which read, 1!<br> <br>&#x201c;Or rather,&#x201d; said Charles Maxim, &#x201c;the child is either one year old or she has come first in a competition. I believe babies are rarely keen participants in competitive sport. Shall we therefore assume it is the former?&#x201d; The girl held on to his earlobe with a grubby finger and thumb. &#x201c;Happy birthday, my child,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Charles did not only give the baby a birthday. He also gave her a name. He chose Sophie, on that first day, on the grounds that nobody could possibly object to it. &#x201c;Your day has been dramatic and extraordinary enough, child,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It might be best to have the most ordinary name available. You can be Mary, or Betty, or Sophie. Or, at a stretch, Mildred. Your choice.&#x201d; Sophie had smiled when he&#x2019;d said &#x201c;Sophie,&#x201d; so Sophie it was. Then he fetched his coat, and folded her up in it, and took her home in a carriage. It rained a little, but it did not worry either of them. Charles did not generally notice the weather, and Sophie had already survived a lot of water that day.<br> <br>Charles had never really known a child before. He told Sophie as much on the way home: &#x201c;I do, I&#x2019;m afraid, understand books far more readily than I understand people. Books are so easy to get along with.&#x201d; The carriage ride took four hours; Charles held Sophie on the very edge of his knee and told her about himself, as though she were an acquaintance at a tea party. He was thirty-six years old, and six foot three. He spoke English to people and French to cats, and Latin to the birds. He had once nearly killed himself trying to read and ride a horse at the same time. &#x201c;But I will be more careful,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;now that there is you, little cello child.&#x201d; Charles&#x2019;s home was beautiful, but it was not safe; it was all staircases and slippery floorboards and sharp corners. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll buy some smaller chairs,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And we&#x2019;ll have thick red carpets! Although&#x2014;how does one go about acquiring carpets? I don&#x2019;t suppose you know, Sophie?&#x201d;<br> <br>Unsurprisingly, Sophie did not answer. She was too young to talk, and she was asleep.<br> <br>She woke when they drew up in a street smelling of trees and horse dung. Sophie loved the house at first sight. The bricks were painted the brightest white in London, and shone even in the dark. The basement was used to store the overflow of books and paintings and several brands of spiders, and the roof belonged to the birds. Charles lived in the space in between.<br> <br>At home, after a hot bath in front of the stove, Sophie looked very white and fragile. Charles had not known that a baby was so terrifyingly tiny a thing. She felt too small in his arms. He was almost relieved when there was a knock at the door; he laid Sophie down carefully on a chair, with a Shakespearean play as a booster seat, and went down the stairs two at a time.<br> <br>When he returned, he was accompanied by a large gray-haired woman; Hamlet was slightly damp, and Sophie was looking embarrassed. Charles scooped her up and set her down&#x2014;hesitating first over an umbrella stand in a corner, and then over the top of the stove&#x2014;inside the sink. He smiled, and his eyebrows and eyes smiled too. &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We all have accidents, Sophie.&#x201d; Then he bowed at the woman. &#x201c;Let me introduce you. Sophie, this is Miss Eliot, from the National Childcare Agency. Miss Eliot, this is Sophie, from the ocean.&#x201d;<br> <br>The woman sighed&#x2014;an official sort of sigh, it would have sounded, from Sophie&#x2019;s place in the sink&#x2014;and frowned, and pulled clean clothes from a parcel. &#x201c;Give her to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Charles took the clothes from her. &#x201c;I took this child from the sea, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; Sophie watched, with large eyes. &#x201c;She has nobody to keep her safe. Whether I like it or not, she is my responsibility.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not forever.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I beg your pardon?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The child is your ward. She is not your daughter.&#x201d; This was the sort of woman who spoke in italics. You would be willing to lay bets that her hobby was organizing people. &#x201c;This is a temporary arrangement.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I beg to differ,&#x201d; said Charles. &#x201c;But we can fight about that later. The child is cold.&#x201d; He handed the undershirt to Sophie, who sucked on it. He took it back and put it on her. Then he hefted her in his arms, as though about to guess her weight at a fair, and looked at her closely. &#x201c;You see? She seems a very intelligent baby.&#x201d; Sophie&#x2019;s fingers, he saw, were long and thin, and clever. &#x201c;And she has hair the color of lightning.

That should be enough, if the poetry I&#x2019;ve read is anything to go by.&#x201d; Charles handed Sophie a red apple, then took it back and rubbed it on his sleeve until he could see his face in it. He said, &#x201c;I am sure the secrets of child care, dark and mysterious though they no doubt are, are not impenetrable.&#x201d;<br> <br>Charles set the baby on his knee, handed her the apple, and began to read out loud to her from A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream.<br> <br>It was not, perhaps, the perfect way to begin a new life, but it showed potential.</p><h2>The Metabolic Makeover: It&#39;s All About Energy</h2><p>Breakthrough research by world-renowned biochemist and best-selling author and board-certified physician, presented in language that everyone can understand.

Addressing a gap in this scholarship, Margaret Malamud investigates why and how advocates for abolition and black civil rights (both black and white) deployed their knowledge of classical literature and history in their struggle for black liberty and equality in the United States. African Americans boldly staked their own claims to the classical world: they deployed texts, ideas and images of ancient Greece, Rome and Egypt in order to establish their authority in debates about slavery, race, politics and education. A central argument of this book is that knowledge and deployment of Classics was a powerful weapon and tool for resistance-as improbable as that might seem now-when wielded by black and white activists committed to the abolition of slavery and the end of the social and economic oppression of free blacks. The book significantly expands our understanding of both black history and classical reception in the United States.</p><p>Margaret Malamud is Professor of Ancient History and Islamic Studies at New Mexico State University, where she is also the S.P. and Margaret Manasse Research Chair in the College of Arts and Sciences.

Over the past forty years, educators there have evolved a distinctive innovative approach that supports children's well-being and fosters their intellectual development through a systematic focus on symbolic representation. Young children (from birth to age six) are encouraged to explore their environment and express themselves through many "languages," or modes of expression, including words, movement, drawing, painting, sculpture, shadow play, collage, and music. Leading children to surprising levels of symbolic skill and creativity, the system is not private and elite but rather involves full-day child care open to all, including children with disabilities.<br><p>This new Second Edition reflects the growing interest and deepening reflection upon the Reggio approach, as well as increasing sophistication in adaptation to the American context.

Each of us can take an active role in our well-being as we age -- a holistic approach that involves sharing with others, reducing stress, and participating in community, among other methods. </p><p> <i>The reason wellness is so important to me is that I have so many things I want to do, and I have to be well to do them. I don't want to live to be eighty or ninety unless I am well enough to be active. I don't want quantity of life without quality.</i> [a fifty-seven-year-old woman] </p><p> <i>Whether I am healthy because I can be busy and happy or whether I am busy and happy because I am healthy is a question. I can do many things that I never had time to do before. Among my activities, I play the recorder in two groups, make ceramics, take part in a book group and a financial-planning group, go to concerts, plays and lectures, garden with the help of a young man, and volunteer at a food collection center. For the good of my somewhat achy leg, I swim three or four times a week, take a yoga class, and sometimes bicycle. Life gets some-what hectic but there's nothing I want to stop because I really enjoy the things I do very much.</i> [a seventy-four-year-old woman] </p><p> At any age, we may have disease or disability to contend with, but we also have resiliency and recovery. We can still be as healthy and active as possible. </p><p> <i>I am multiply disabled -- legally blind, with chronic pain syndrome from head and neck injuries. I am very sold on the pain program at my local hospital. Instead of drugs (I was using narcotics), much of my pain can be relieved by physical therapy, particularly the aerobic treadmill, jogging, and the stationary-bicycle program. Every day, in addition to the aerobics, I do forty-five minutes or so of muscle stretching and isometrics, push-ups, sit-ups, etc. I am taught that these changes I am making in my lifestyle must be permanent, daily, lifelong.</i> [a forty-one-year-old woman] </p><p> The self-care necessary to be well begins with self-value. <i>Deciding</i> on wellness reflects and fosters that self-value. We can prolong our healthy, active years by paying attention to good nutrition, activity and movement, solitude and rest, good relationships, and our links to the communities in which we live and work. </p><p> <i>I'd been depressed and anxious and using sleeping pills for a number of years. With the help of a friend who was a therapist, I became aware of a lot of anger I'd been holding toward my mother and father -- and toward my husband. I started adopting some new habits -- like taking care of myself physically. I was all out of shape -- I started jogging and I took yoga to learn to relax. Feeling better physically bolstered my self-esteem and gave me the courage to confront my husband about the inequities in our relationship and to push for changes.</i> [a woman in her fifties] </p><p> Studies show that older people who give themselves a better health rating than their physician does frequently prove, in time, the greater accuracy of their own intuitive feelings about the state of their health. </p><p> <i>The best way I know to stay healthy and alive is to stay away from pills and out of the rocking chair.</i> [a ninety-year-old woman] </p><p> To keep involved and growing, we must recognize and fight ageism in all of its manifestations. We can deal with ageism more effectively if we have energy and strength. </p><p> <i>I realized that in another year I'll be on the senior citizens' list for my town, because once you turn sixty you automatically get the mailings. And you know, this is silly, but my mailman is someone I know personally, and I feel it's none of his business how old I am, but he would see those mailings.</i> </p><p> <b>Aging Is Not Old Age</b> </p><p> There is a difference between "aging" and "geting old." Aging encompasses all the biological changes that occur over a lifetime -- for example, increase and decrease in height, onset and cessation of menstruation, and shaping of the young-adult and middle-aged body. Changes in thymic hormones are sometimes used as a sign of the aging process because the thymus gland, a pyramid-shaped gland beneath the breastbone involved in regulation of the immune system, begins to shrink slowly after the age of two. The pace of biological aging differs among individuals. In all people, some organs age faster than others. The impact of genetic and environmental factors on biological aging is just beginning to be understood. </p><p> Getting old, on the other hand, is a social concept, and our feelings about it may only be slightly related to the biological processes of aging. </p><p> It is not surprising that women have such strong feelings about being identified as aging; our culture has a strong prejudice against older women. Traditional cultures often hold their elders in high regard, seeing them as storehouses of wisdom to be transmitted to the next generation; older women, especially, are often seen as healers. The Pueblo Indians, for example, believe their elders' rituals help the sun to rise each morning. Imagine how it would feel to believe oneself so vital to life itself! </p><p> <i>For as long as I can remember, I've cherished an image of my future self as a "wise old woman." I can see myself now -- my silver hair provides softness around my face. I live in a log cabin by a stream, and my fireplace walls are decorated with welt-used iron skillets and copper pots. I'm preparing to receive young guests who come regularly to visit me. I find my fulfillment in teaching them the wisdom gained over my lifetime. This image has sustained me through many dark hours in which I feared I would never make a contribution to life.</i> [a forty-three-year-old woman] </p><p> It is especially important to distinguish physiological aging from the capacity for intellectual growth and social participation. Even very ill or frail old people can continue to learn and to be socially involved. If aging well is our goal, it is important to view health as the World Health Organization defined it in 1946: "A state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not just the absence of disease or infirmity." Continued engagement and productivity is the best way of delaying the onset of frailty in the older years. Robert Butler argues that "health and productivity are interacting conditions: the unproductive human is at higher risk of illness and economic dependency and the sick person is limited in productivity and is, therefore, at higher risk of dependency." </p><p> Scientists have learned a great deal about senescence, the biological changes that occur in different cells and tissues over time, but they still have fundamental questions about how and why these changes come about. Some think that aging is controlled by a genetically programmed "biological clock," but others think that aging results from cumulative damage to certain systems in the body. It may be many years before we know which theory or combination of theories explains biological aging. </p><p> Research is currently exploring factors that seem associated with longevity in the hope of finding a formula for extending human life or minimizing conditions associated with aging. We must be careful to differentiate between test results in the laboratory and what happens in our own bodies. For example, rats and mice placed on a diet containing 30 to 50 percent fewer calories than the normal diet for caged laboratory rodents but containing essential vitamins and minerals live longer than control animals. But studies of the relationship between longevity and weight in humans have produced conflicting results. </p><p> Commercial manufacturers sometimes take advantage of highly publicized laboratory results to promote products that have no proven value. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) supplements sold in stores are a good example of this. Research has discovered that SOD, an enzyme involved in the repair of cellular damage, is found at higher levels in animals with long life spans than in those with shorter ones. Advertisements touted SOD as an antiaging drug, but in fact, SOD is broken down during digestion and cannot be reassembled in the body. Thus, these diet supplements have no effect on human longevity and are a waste of money. </p><p> Laboratory studies of the effects of vitamin and mineral supplements on the aging process also must be evaluated carefully. The possible anticancer action of vitamins E, C, and beta carotene, and the antiaging actions of the mineral selenium deserve further investigation, but the evidence does not support the contention that these supplements extend life. </p><p> It is unlikely that researchers will find a single intervention to stop aging. Indeed, any promise of extraordinary benefit probably indicates something of which the buyer should beware. In the future, scientific advances in many areas may delay specific aging processes, such as the decline in immune function, but until then, caution should be used in assessing claims for the life-extending or rejuvenating properties of any antiaging agents or regimens. </p><p> The term <i>life expectancy</i> refers to the average number of years of life expected for an individual in a given population. <i>Life span</i> is the maximum number of years of life possible for a species. Researchers involved in efforts to increase understanding of the aging process have found ways to increase both the life expectancy and the life spans of experimental animals. </p><p> The average life expectancy in developed countries has increased steadily during the past two hundred years as a result of improvements in housing, nutrition, health care, and sanitation. In the United States today, the average life expectancy at birth is seventy-nine years for a girl; for a boy it is seventy-two years. More people are living to an old age than in past centuries, but the human life span has remained fixed at about 115 years for all of recorded history. </p><p> Although the prospect that the life span might be increased is exciting, we believe that the present focus of aging research should be to improve the quality of life for all members of society. The ways to do this are by perfecting techniques for the prevention and treatment of disease (including illnesses previously thought to be unavoidable signs of aging) and by changing the view that old age is a sure predictor of declining function. </p><p> <b>Women and Research</b> </p><p> The major problem with most clinical studies on aging is that until recently very few of them have involved women. For example, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, which began in 1958, did not admit women volunteers until 1978. This omission was due to the traditional tendency to view males as the norm for the species. Processes that occur only in women have generally attracted less interest than male-related processes. In addition, studies focusing on one gender are less expensive, recruitment of subjects is easier, and data analysis is less complex. </p><p> Women are increasingly included in research and drug trials, but there are still not enough older people, women and men, included. Trials for drugs to treat arthritis, for example, rarely include people of the ages most likely to be using them. Recognizing that four fifths of persons over age seventy-five living at home disabled by physical frailty are women, the National Institute on Aging did start the Women's Aging Study in 1991 to assess the conditions and diseases responsible for frailty. In 1995 look for results that, for the first time, will include minority women. We must continue to monitor proposed research both for its attention to older women's priorities and for inclusion of women from diverse groups. </p><p> Health statistics indicate that life expectancy at birth is greater for women than for men in most parts of the world, but that the length of time varies significantly depending on the country. For example, both women and men live longer in Sweden than they do in the United States, but the longevity gap between the genders is much smaller in Sweden. Research designed to help us understand the reasons for these differences could help improve the quality of life for all people. </p><p> <b>Changing Health Habits</b> </p><p> Science is developing information about the aging process that strongly suggests that our health choices -- positive or negative -- greatly affect how we age. Growing old well -- maintaining, even improving, physical and emotional health -- is something over which today's women in midlife and beyond have more control than ever before. </p><p> There are no magic wands or potions for good health, no fountains of youth, no products that cure all ills, no vitamins that prevent all ailments. A wellness program requires effort, planning, and persistence, but it is an investment that pays back with unbelievably high interest. When we feel good we are more likely to exercise, eat well, and take care of ourselves, all of which in turn are likely to make us feel better. Thus we create a "virtuous cycle." </p><p> Habits are like the backbones of our lives -- the firm structures upon which we can rely. It helps not to have to think about every step we take -- to have comfortable routines in our lives. But as we grow older, some habits may no longer serve us well. The morning mad rush routine that helped us get ourselves and a whole family off to school and work may no longer be necessary. We may be happier and calmer with fifteen minutes of quiet meditation before starting our day. Illness may require us to change from a vigorous exercise program to a more gentle one. Or we may be inspired by new information or changes in our lives to pay better attention to ourselves, to pursue renewed health and vitality by dramatically altering our pattern of health habits. </p><p> It is not true that as we grow older, we become less flexible, less able to change. Change and renewal are possible at any age. </p><p> <i>In my later years, my concept of time has changed, as has my use of it.

Auden: Critical Editions)</h2><p><p>When it was first published in 1947, <i>The Age of Anxiety</i>--W. H. Auden's last, longest, and most ambitious book-length poem--immediately struck a powerful chord, capturing the imagination of the cultural moment that it diagnosed and named. Beginning as a conversation among four strangers in a barroom on New York's Third Avenue, Auden's analysis of Western culture during the Second World War won the Pulitzer Prize and inspired a symphony by Leonard Bernstein as well as a ballet by Jerome Robbins. Yet reviews of the poem were sharply divided, and today, despite its continuing fame, it is unjustly neglected by readers.</p><p> This volume--the first annotated, critical edition of the poem--introduces this important work to a new generation of readers by putting it in historical and biographical context and elucidating its difficulties. Alan Jacobs's introduction and thorough annotations help today's readers understand and appreciate the full richness of a poem that contains some of Auden's most powerful and beautiful verse, and that still deserves a central place in the canon of twentieth-century poetry.</p></p><p><p>"Fascinating and hair-raising."<b>--Leonard Bernstein</b></p><p>"[One of] Auden's outstanding American works."<b>--Stephen Spender</b></p><b>Alan Jacobs</b> is the Clyde S.

Self-doubt, panic attacks, anxiety disorders, and personal fears of all kinds present major challenges to contemporary medical science. Rudolf Steiner&#x2019;s spiritual research offers a startlingly original and complementary contribution to this problem. True insight into psychological issues requires knowledge of the influences of spiritual beings, he suggests. In everyday life we are all confronted with metaphysical entities that can hinder or aid our development. Many forms of anxiety and self-doubt derive from such meetings on the border&#x2015;or threshold&#x2015;of consciousness. Furthermore, these &#x201c;threshold experiences&#x201d; are exacerbated today by a general loosening of the subtle bodies and components of the human soul. <br><br>As these constitutional changes persist, according to Rudolf Steiner a condition of &#x201c;dissociation&#x201d; becomes increasingly common. A healthy emotional life will never be possible unless individuals engage in a conscious practice of personal self-development, strengthening their constitution through the action of one&#x2019;s &#x201c;I.&#x201d; <br><br>The expertly selected and collated texts in <i>Self-Doubt</i>&nbsp;offer numerous cognitive and practical ideas for the improvement of everyday mental and emotional health.<br><br><ul><li><b>TOPICS INCLUDE:</b></li><br><li>The origin of error, fear, and nervousness </li><li>Crossing the threshold in the development of humanity and the individual </li><li>The polarity of shame and fear </li><li>The polarity of doubt and terrifying disorientation </li><li>The polarity of skepticism and claustrophobia, astraphobia, and agoraphobia </li><li>The origin of panic </li><li>Anxiety </li><li>The multilayered nature of terrifying disorientation </li><li>Healing aspects of the anthroposophic path of training </li><li>The spiritual-scientific qualities of fear compared with standardized diagnostic terms</li></ul></p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.</p><h2>Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries</h2><p><p><strong>"[Tyson] tackles a great range of subjects...with great humor, humility, and&#x2015;most important&#x2015;humanity." &#x2015;<em>Entertainment Weekly</em></strong></p><p>Loyal readers of the monthly "Universe" essays in <em>Natural History</em> magazine have long recognized Neil deGrasse Tyson's talent for guiding them through the mysteries of the cosmos with clarity and enthusiasm. Bringing together more than forty of Tyson's favorite essays, <em>Death by Black Hole</em> explores a myriad of cosmic topics, from what it would be like to be inside a black hole to the movie industry's feeble efforts to get its night skies right. One of America's best-known astrophysicists, Tyson is a natural teacher who simplifies the complexities of astrophysics while sharing his infectious fascination for our universe.</p></p><p>Neil deGrasse Tyson is an astrophysicist with the American Museum of Natural History, host of the hit radio and Emmy-nominated TV show StarTalk, and the New York Times best-selling author of Astrophysics for People in a Hurry and Accessory to War: The Unspoken Alliance Between Astrophysics and the Military. He lives in New York City.What comes across with immediacy is how much fun Tyson, director of New York Citys Hayden Planetarium, finds in astronomy and how much he wants listeners to enjoy it, too. Narrator Dion Graham captures the astronomers excited, sometimes ironic, tone to perfection. Tysons commentary runs the gamut--from pointing out errors in the science of his favorite sci-fi movies to describing the grisly details of what would happen to a person who fell into a black hole. The production is great for the nonscientist who likes to stay up-to-date with whats going on in astronomy. The combination of a passionate scientist who entertains and a narrator who completely captures the authors style and intent is powerfully enjoyable. D.G.

He has revised several of James Rachels&#x2019; books, including <em>Problems from Philosophy</em> (second edition, 2009) and <em>The Right Thing to Do</em> (fifth edition, 2010), which is the companion anthology to this book. Stuart won the United States Chess Championship in 1989 at the age of 20, and he is a Bronze Life Master at bridge. His website is www.jamesrachels.org/stuart.<br><br><p>James Rachels, the distinguished American moral philosopher, was born in Columbus, Georgia. He&nbsp;graduated from Mercer University in Macon in 1962. He received his PhD in 1967 from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He taught at the University of Richmond, New York University, the University of Miami, Duke University, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where he spent the last twenty-six years of his career. </p><p>1971 saw the publication of Rachels&#x2019; groundbreaking textbook <em>Moral Problems</em>, which ignited the movement in America away from teaching ethical theory towards teaching concrete practical issues. <em>Moral Problems</em> sold 100,000 copies over three editions. In 1975, Rachels wrote &#x201c;Active and Passive Euthanasia,&#x201d; arguing that the distinction so important in the law between killing and letting die has no rational basis. Originally appearing in the New England Journal of Medicine, this essay has been reprinted roughly 300 times and is a staple of undergraduate education. <em>The End of Life</em> (1986) was about the morality of killing and the value of life. <em>Created from Animals </em>(1990) argued that a Darwinian world-view has widespread philosophical implications, including drastic implications for our treatment of nonhuman animals. <em>Can Ethics Provide Answers?</em> (1997) was Rachels&#x2019; first collection of papers (others are expected posthumously). Rachels&#x2019; McGraw-Hill textbook, <em>The Elements of Moral Philosophy</em>, is now in its fourth edition and is easily the best-selling book of its kind.</p><p>Over his career, Rachels wrote 5 books and 85 essays, edited 7 books and gave about 275 professional lectures. His work has been translated into Dutch, Italian, Japanese, and Serbo-Croatian. James Rachels is widely admired as a stylist, as his prose is remarkably free of jargon and clutter. A major theme in his work is that reason can resolve difficult moral issues. He has given reasons for moral vegetarianism and animal rights, for affirmative action (including quotas), for the humanitarian use of euthanasia, and for the idea that parents owe as much moral consideration to other people&#x2019;s children as they do to their own. James Rachels died of cancer on September 5th, 2003, in Birmingham, Alabama.</p></p><h2>Money in the Ground-Insider&#39;s Guide to Oil and Gas Deals (4th Ed.)</h2><p>This is your highest-yielding oil and gas investment.

Frustrated and unfulfilled, a product of the bourgeoisie he will grow to despise, he has difficulty acknowledging his nascent attraction to men. At Cambridge he meets Clive, who opens his eyes to a less conventional view of the nature of love. Yet when Maurice is confronted by the societal pressures of life beyond university, self-doubt and heartbreak threaten his quest for happiness.</p><p>Edward Morgan Forster was born in London in 1879, attended Tonbridge School and went on to King`s College, Cambridge in 1897, where he retained a lifelong connection and was elected to an Honorary Fellowship in 1946.

She died soon after its completion, and it was published in an edition with Northanger Abbey in 1818. <br><br>In the novel, Anne Elliot, the heroine Austen called 'almost too good for me,' has let herself be persuaded not to marry Frederick Wentworth, a fine and attractive man without means. Eight years later, Captain Wentworth returns from the Napoleonic Wars with a triumphant naval career behind him, a substantial fortune to his name, and an eagerness to wed. Austen explores the complexities of human relationships as they change over time. 'She is a prose Shakespeare,' Thomas Macaulay wrote of Austen in 1842. 'She has given us a multitude of characters, all, in a certain sense, commonplace. Yet they are all as perfectly discriminated from each other as if they were the most eccentric of human beings.'<br><br><i>Persuasion</i> is the last work of one of the greatest of novelists, the end of a quiet career pursued in anonymity in rural England that produced novels which continue to give pleasure to millions of readers throughout the world.</p><p>Anne Elliot, heroine of Austen&#39;s last novel, did something we can all relate to: Long ago, she let the love of her life get away. In this case, she had allowed herself to be persuaded by a trusted family friend that the young man she loved wasn&#39;t an adequate match, social stationwise, and that Anne could do better. The novel opens some seven years after Anne sent her beau packing, and she&#39;s still alone. But then the guy she never stopped loving comes back from the sea. As always, Austen&#39;s storytelling is so confident, you can&#39;t help but allow yourself to be taken on the enjoyable journey.This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

An unusually lucid and inclusive explication of what it ultimately at stake in the culture wars over the nature, goals, and efficacy of history as a discipline."&#x2015;<em>Booklist</em></strong></p></p><p>We have lost our grip on historical truth. Popular films depict subterranean conspiracies that shape historical events and public knowledge of those events. Best-selling narrative histories dissolve the border between fact and fiction, allowing the author&#39;s imagination to roam freely. Influential critics dissolve the author herself into one among many sources of meaning, reducing historical knowledge to a series of texts engaged with each other, not with the past. Powerful constituencies call for histories that affirm more than inform. This new book by three of our most accomplished historians engages the various criticisms that have fragmented the authority of historical knowledge. Although acknowledging degrees of legitimacy in the criticisms, the authors launch a pragmatic response that supports the historian, as they put it, in her long climb, notebook computer in tow, up the 300 stairs to the archives in Lyon. Even if historical truth is an ever-receding goal, the effort to approach it, they show, is legitimate, worthy, and governed by agreed-upon rules. And while affirming the claims of women and ethnic minorities to a rightful place in any narrative of American history, the authors insist on the accountability of history. They outline a coherent narrative of the American past that incorporates its multicultural dimension without special pleading.<p><strong>Joyce Appleby</strong> (1929&#x2015;2016) was a professor of history emerita at UCLA, the author of <em>Shores of Knowledge</em>, <em>The Relentless Revolution</em>, and the coauthor of <em>Telling the Truth about History</em>, among many other works.

This collection contains all of his poetry: the early work, which is often undervalued even today, the poems on which his reputation rests including the Odes and the two versions of the uncompleted epic Hyperion, and work which only came to light after his death including his attempts at drama and comic verse. It all demonstrates the extent to which he tested his own dictum throughout his short creative life. That life spanned one of the most remarkable periods in English history in the aftermath of the French Revolution and this collection, with its detailed introductions and notes, aims to place the poems very much in their context. The collection is ample proof that Keats deservedly achieved his wish to &#39;be among the English Poets after my death&#39;</p><p>John Keats (1921 2000) was the author of eleven books, including The Crack in the Picture Window, School without Scholars, and The Insolent Chariots.

The accessible writing style engages students and brings some of the excitement of domestic and global economic news into the classroom. Schiller emphasizes how policymakers must choose between government intervention and market reliance to resolve the core issues of what, how, and for whom to produce. This strategic choice is highlighted throughout the full range of micro, macro, and international issues, and every chapter ends with a policy issue that emphasizes the markets vs. government dilemma. The authors teach economics in a relevant context, filling chapters with the real facts and applications of economic life. Schiller is also the only principles text that presents all macro theory in the single consistent context of the AS/AD framework. <p> <i>The Macro Economy Today</i>, fourteenth edition, is thoroughly integrated with the adaptive digital tools available in McGraw-Hill&#x2019;s LearnSmart Advantage Suite, proven to increase student engagement and success in the course.</p></p><p><strong>Karen Gebhardt</strong> is a faculty member in the Department of Economics at Colorado State University (CSU). Dr. Gebhardt has a passion for teaching economics. She regularly instructs large introductory courses in macro and microeconomics, small honors sections of these core principles courses, and upper division courses in Public Finance, Microeconomics, and International Trade, as well as a graduate course in teaching methods. She is an early adopter of technology in the classroom and advocates strongly for it because she sees the difference it makes in student engagement and learning.

Schiller</strong> has over four decades of experience teaching introductory economics at American University, the University of California (Berkeley and Santa Cruz), the University of Maryland, and the University of Nevada (Reno). He has given guest lectures at more than 300 colleges ranging from Fresno, California, to Istanbul, Turkey. Dr. Schiller&#x2019;s unique contribution to teaching is his ability to relate basic principles to current socioeconomic problems, institutions, and public policy decisions. This perspective is evident throughout Essentials of Economics. Dr. Schiller derives this policy focus from his extensive experience as a Washington consultant. He has been a consultant to most major federal agencies, many congressional committees, and political candidates. In addition, he has evaluated scores of government programs and helped design others. His studies of income inequality, poverty, discrimination, training programs, tax reform, pensions, welfare, Social Security, and lifetime wage patterns have appeared in both professional journals and popular media. Dr. Schiller is also a frequent commentator on economic policy for television, radio, and newspapers. Dr. Schiller received his PhD from Harvard and his BA degree, with great distinction, from the University of California (Berkeley).

She outpaced all but a handful of her male mentors and counterparts, while only Lee Krasner stands as a possible rival among her female counterparts. Although well regarded by critics, fellow artists, and the general public, Mitchell's achievement has never received full recognition; her work has not been shown in New York for more than twenty-five years. This exquisitely illustrated volume and the exhibition that it accompanies restore the artist to her rightful place in the history of American painting. Spanning Mitchell's entire career, from early works of 1951 until the year of her death, <i>The Paintings of Joan Mitchell </i>includes a wealth of breathtaking paintings, both intimate and grand in scale, that reveal Mitchell's fierce dedication to her art and reflect both the struggles and the artistic triumphs she achieved with her distinctive vision of Abstract Expressionism.<br><br>Jane Livingston draws on the artist's personal papers, including her journals and extensive correspondence, to provide an illuminating interpretation of the artist and her work. Linda Nochlin, who was a friend of Mitchell, discusses the artist's experience working in a field dominated by men. A third text by Whitney Curator Yvette Lee explores a distinctive and little-known suite of paintings entitled <i>La Grande Vall�e, </i>created in 1983-84. Mounted with the full cooperation of the estate of Joan Mitchell, the exhibition contains many paintings rarely seen before--and in some cases never publicly exhibited. This book includes an exhibition history; an extensive artist bibliography of related monographs, reviews, and filmed interviews; and color plates and listing of all the works appearing in the exhibition.</p><p>In addition to <i>The Paintings of Joan Mitchell, </i><b>Jane Livingston </b>curated the exhibitions and authored the books <i>Richard Avedon: Evidence </i>and <i>Richard Diebenkorn: A Retrospective, </i>all at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Among her other books are <i>The New York School: Photographs, 1936-1963 </i>(1992) and <i>Hispanic Art in the United States: Thirty Contemporary Painters &amp; Sculptors </i>(1987). <b>Linda Nochlin </b>is Lila Acheson Wallace Professor of Modern Art at New York University's Institute of Fine Arts and author of many books including <i>Representing Women </i>(1999). <b>Yvette Lee </b>is Assistant Curator for Special Projects at the Whitney Museum of American Art.This catalog accompanies the first solo exhibition of the paintings of Joan Mitchell (1926-92) in New York City in over 20 years. (The event will be at the Whitney until the end of this month and then will travel to Birmingham, AL, Forth Worth, TX, and Washington, DC.) Though considered a foremost abstract expressionist, Mitchell disliked being affiliated with the movement and especially objected to being viewed as a woman artist. Using Mitchell's journals and correspondence, Livingston (Richard Avedon, etc.) follows the evolution of Mitchell's painting and discusses her technique, which showed more concern with color than with the integrity of the medium. Taking a feminist approach, Linda Nochlin demonstrates that Mitchell's rage at being viewed as a "feminine other" was transformed into a positive energy that brought emotional intensity to her paintings. And Whitney curator Yvette Lee discusses the "Grand Vall e" series of 16 paintings (1983-84) as some of Mitchell's most luminous and lyrical. This book compares well with the first monograph on Mitchell, Judith Bernstock's Joan Mitchell, which also contains high-quality color reproductions and scholarly essays. The Bernstock book, however, focuses more on the artist's paintings in relation to the poetry that she loved.

More and more parents are refusing to vaccinate their children for fear it causes autism, though this link can been consistently disproved. And about 40 percent of Americans believe that the threat of global warming is exaggerated, despite near consensus in the scientific community that manmade climate change is real.<br><br>Why do people believe bunk? And what causes them to embrace such pseudoscientific beliefs and practices? Noted skeptic Massimo Pigliucci sets out to separate the fact from the fantasy in this entertaining exploration of the nature of science, the borderlands of fringe science, and&#x2014;borrowing a famous phrase from philosopher Jeremy Bentham&#x2014;the nonsense on stilts. Presenting case studies on a number of controversial topics, Pigliucci cuts through the ambiguity surrounding science to look more closely at how science is conducted, how it is disseminated, how it is interpreted, and what it means to our society. The result is in many ways a &#x201c;taxonomy of bunk&#x201d; that explores the intersection of science and culture at large.<br><br>No one&#x2014;not the public intellectuals in the culture wars between defenders and detractors of science nor the believers of pseudoscience themselves&#x2014;is spared Pigliucci&#x2019;s incisive analysis. In the end, Nonsense on Stilts is a timely reminder of the need to maintain a line between expertise and assumption. Broad in scope and implication, it is also ultimately a captivating guide for the intelligent citizen who wishes to make up her own mind while navigating the perilous debates that will affect the future of our planet.</p></p><p><p>Massimo Pigliucci is professor of philosophy at the City University of New York. He has written many books, including, most recently, Making Sense of Evolution, with Jonathan Kaplan, also published by the University of Chicago Press.</p>&#34;A refreshingly original excursion over the unmarked territory separating science from pseudoscience and nonscience, Nonsense on Stilts is a thoughtful examination of the tumultuous terrain between the two and a primer on how one tells the difference.&#34; - Kendrick Frazier, editor of Skeptical Inquirer.</p><h2>Belinda (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>The lively comedy of this novel in which a young woman comes of age amid the distractions and temptations of London high society belies the challenges it poses to the conventions of courtship, the dependence of women, and the limitations of domesticity.

Admired by her contemporary, Jane Austen, and later by Thackeray and Turgenev, Edgeworth tackles issues of gender and race in a manner at once comic and thought-provoking.

Told in turns by each of the family members&#x2013;including Addie herself&#x2013;the novel ranges in mood from dark comedy to the deepest pathos. Originally published in 1930.<br><br><b>The Sound and the Fury</b><br>First published in 1929, Faulkner created his &#x201c;heart&#x2019;s darling,&#x201d; the beautiful and tragic Caddy Compson, whose story Faulkner told through separate monologues by her three brothers&#x2013;the idiot Benjy, the neurotic suicidal Quentin and the monstrous Jason. <br><br><b>Light in August</b><br><b>Light in August</b>, a novel about hopeful perseverance in the face of mortality, features some of Faulkner&#x2019;s most memorable characters: guileless, dauntless Lena Grove, in search of the father of her unborn child; Reverend Gail Hightower, who is plagued by visions of Confederate horsemen; and Joe Christmas, a desperate, mysterious drifter consumed by his mixed ancestry. Originally published in 1932.<br><br><b>Take a seat in Oprah&#x2019;s Classroom and sign up for Faulkner 101 on www.oprah.com/bookclub.<br></b></p><p>The 2005 Summer Selection is available in an exclusive three volume boxed edition that includes a special reader&#39;s guide with an introduction by Oprah Winfrey.William Cuthbert Faulkner was born in 1897 in New Albany, Mississippi, the first of four sons of Murry and Maud Butler Falkner (he later added the &#x201c;u&#x201d; to the family name himself). In 1904 the family moved to the university town of Oxford, Mississippi, where Faulkner was to spend most of his life. He was named for his great-grandfather &#x201c;The Old Colonel,&#x201d; a Civil War veteran who built a railroad, wrote a bestselling romantic novel called <b>The White Rose of Memphis</b>, became a Mississippi state legislator, and was eventually killed in what may or may not have been a duel with a disgruntled business partner. Faulkner identified with this robust and energetic ancestor and often said that he inherited the &#x201c;ink stain&#x201d; from him. <br><br>Never fond of school, Faulkner left at the end of football season his senior year of high school, and began working at his grandfather&#x2019;s bank. In 1918, after his plans to marry his sweetheart Estelle Oldham were squashed by their families, he tried to enlist as a pilot in the U.S. Army but was rejected because he did not meet the height and weight requirements. He went to Canada, where he pretended to be an Englishman and joined the RAF training program there. Although he did not complete his training until after the war ended and never saw combat, he returned to his hometown in uniform, boasting of war wounds. He briefly attended the University of Mississippi, where he began to publish his poetry. <br><br>After spending a short time living in New York, he again returned to Oxford, where he worked at the university post office. His first book, a collection of poetry, <b>The Marble Faun</b>, was published at Faulkner&#x2019;s own expense in 1924. The writer Sherwood Anderson, whom he met in New Orleans in 1925, encouraged him to try writing fiction, and his first novel, <b>Soldier&#x2019;s Pay</b>, was published in 1926. It was followed by <b>Mosquitoes</b>. His next novel, which he titled <b>Flags in the Dust</b>, was rejected by his publisher and twelve others to whom he submitted it. It was eventually published in drastically edited form as <b>Sartoris</b> (the original version was not issued until after his death). Meanwhile, he was writing <b>The Sound and the Fury</b>, which, after being rejected by one publisher, came out in 1929 and received many ecstatic reviews, although it sold poorly. Yet again, a new novel, <b>Sanctuary</b>, was initially rejected by his publisher, this time as &#x201c;too shocking.&#x201d; While working on the night shift at a power plant, Faulkner wrote what he was determined would be his masterpiece, <b>As I Lay Dying</b>. He finished it in about seven weeks, and it was published in 1930, again to generally good reviews and mediocre sales.<br><br>In 1929 Faulkner had finally married his childhood sweetheart, Estelle, after her divorce from her first husband. They had a premature daughter, Alabama, who died ten days after birth in 1931; a second daughter, Jill, was born in 1933. <br><br>With the eventual publication of his most sensational and violent (as well as, up till then, most successful) novel, <b>Sanctuary</b> (1931), Faulkner was invited to write scripts for MGM and Warner Brothers, where he was responsible for much of the dialogue in the film versions of Hemingway&#x2019;s <b>To Have and Have Not</b> and Chandler&#x2019;s <b>The Big Sleep</b>, and many other films. He continued to write novels and published many stories in the popular magazines. <b>Light in August</b> (1932) was his first attempt to address the racial issues of the South, an effort continued in <b>Absalom, Absalom!</b> (1936), and <b>Go Down, Moses</b> (1942). By 1946, most of Faulkner&#x2019;s novels were out of print in the United States (although they remained well-regarded in Europe), and he was seen as a minor, regional writer. But then the influential editor and critic Malcolm Cowley, who had earlier championed Hemingway and Fitzgerald and others of their generation, put together the <b>Portable Faulkner</b>, and once again Faulkner&#x2019;s genius was recognized, this time for good. He received the 1949 Nobel Prize for Literature as well as many other awards and accolades, including the National Book Award and the Gold Medal from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and France&#x2019;s Legion of Honor.<br><br>In addition to several collections of short fiction, his other novels include <b>Pylon</b> (1935), <b>The Unvanquished</b> (1938), <b>The Wild Palms</b> (1939), <b>The Hamlet</b> (1940), <b>Intruder in the Dust</b> (1948), <b>A Fable</b> (1954), <b>The Town</b> (1957), <b>The Mansion</b> (1959), and <b>The Reivers</b> (1962). <br><br>William Faulkner died of a heart attack on July 6, 1962, in Oxford, Mississippi, where he is buried.</p><h2>Oliver Twist (Puffin Classics)</h2><p>A poor orphan&#39;s adventures in the criminal underworld of mid-nineteenth-century London are the central theme of Dickens&#39; second major novel</p><p>10 1.5-hour cassettes<p>Starved and mistreated, empty bowl in hand, the young hero musters the courage to approach his master, saying, "Please, sir, I want some more." Oliver Twist's famous cry of the heart has resounded with readers since the novel's initial appearance in 1837, and the book remains a popular favorite with fans of all ages.<br>Dickens was no stranger to the pain of hunger and the degradation of poverty. He poured his own youthful experience of Victorian London's unspeakable squalor into this realistic depiction of the link between destitution and crime. Oliver escapes his miserable servitude by running away to London, where he unwillingly but inevitably joins a scabrous gang of thieves. Masterminded by the loathsome Fagin, the underworld crew features some of Dickens' most memorable characters, including the juvenile pickpocket known as the Artful Dodger, the vicious Bill Sikes, and gentle Nancy, an angel of self-sacrifice.<br>A profound social critic, Dickens introduced genteel readers to the problems of the poor in a way that had rarely been attempted before.

Peace (Loeb Classical Library No. 488)</h2><p><p>Aristophanes of Athens (ca. 446&#x2013;386 BCE), one of the world's greatest comic dramatists, has been admired since antiquity for his iridescent wit and beguiling fantasy, exuberant language, and brilliant satire of the social, intellectual, and political life of Athens at its height. He wrote at least forty plays, of which eleven have survived complete. In this new Loeb Classical Library edition of Aristophanes, Jeffrey Henderson presents a freshly edited Greek text and a lively, unexpurgated translation with full explanatory notes.</p><p>Three plays are in Volume II of the new edition. Socrates' "Thinkery" is at the center of <i>Clouds,</i> which spoofs untraditional techniques for educating young men. <i>Wasps</i> satirizes Athenian enthusiasm for jury service and the law courts as well as the city's susceptibility to demagogues. In <i>Peace,</i> a rollicking attack on war-makers, the farmer-hero makes his famous trip to heaven on a dung beetle to discuss the issues with Zeus.</p></p><p><p>Jeffrey Henderson is William Goodwin Aurelio Professor of Greek Language and Literature at Boston University.

But in <em>The Sacred Depths of Nature</em>, eminent biologist Ursula Goodenough shows us that the scientific world view need not be a source of despair. Indeed, it can be a wellspring of solace and hope.<br> This eloquent volume reconciles the modern scientific understanding of reality with our timeless spiritual yearnings for reverence and continuity. Looking at topics such as evolution, emotions, sexuality, and death, Goodenough writes with rich, uncluttered detail about the workings of nature in general and of living creatures in particular. Her luminous clarity makes it possible for even non-scientists to appreciate that the origins of life and the universe are no less meaningful because of our increasingly scientific understanding of them. At the end of each chapter, Goodenough's spiritual reflections respond to the complexity of nature with vibrant emotional intensity and a sense of reverent wonder.<br> A beautifully written celebration of molecular biology with meditations on the spiritual and religious meaning that can be found at the heart of science, this volume makes an important contribution to the ongoing dialog between science and religion. This book will engage anyone who was ever mesmerized--or terrified--by the mysteries of existence.<br></p><p>Ursula Goodenough is an internationally recognized cell biologist; she is also an accomplished amateur theologian--an unusual combination of interests in a time when science and religion are widely divided. In <i>The Sacred Depths of Nature</i>, she proposes what she calls a "planetary ethic" drawing on the lessons of both science and metaphysics, celebrating some of the mysteries that are central to both: "the mystery of why there is anything at all, rather than nothing," for one, and "the mystery of why the universe seems so strange," for another. Exploring scientifically based narratives about the creation of the universe and the origins of life, Goodenough forges a kind of religious naturalism that will not be unfamiliar to readers of New Age literature--save that her naturalism has the hard-nosed rigor of a laboratory-trained scholar behind it. Goodenough offers a crash course in the life sciences for her readers, encompassing the basics, for instance, of biochemistry in just a few paragraphs (and getting it right in the bargain), touching on Darwinian biology and population dynamics and even chaos theory to make "an epic of evolution" that has all the hallmarks of an origin myth. Faith and reason, in her view, are not mutually exclusive, and her well-written treatise makes a good argument for bridging the gap between the two. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i><br><strong>Ursula Goodenough</strong> is Professor of Biology at Washington University. One of America's leading cell biologists, she is the author of a bestselling textbook on genetics, and has served as President of the American Society of Cell Biology and of the Institute on Religion in an Age of Science.

Read a few pages. Reflect. Relax. Breathe. Smile.

She is a well-seasoned yogini, who writes from personal experience on how to use the events of daily life as yoga poses for the mind and the heart." --Patricia Walden, featured in Yoga Journal's Yoga Practice for Beginners </p><p>"Judith Lasater explains how her practice has helped her to sort through life's tangles, clarify her values, and renew her commitment to her ideals.

He takes on alcohol and tobacco interests that buy political protection with campaign contributions and seed a culture of substance abuse among our nation's children and teens. He explains the importance of parent power, proposes revolutionary changes in prevention, treatment, and criminal justice, and calls upon every individual and institution to confront this plague that has maimed and killed more Americans than all our wars, natural catastrophes, and traffic accidents combined.</p></p><p><b>Joseph A. Califano, Jr.</b> served as LBJ's domestic affairs chief and Jimmy Carter's secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, where he started the nation's first national anti-smoking campaign in 1978, calling cigarette smoking "Public Health Enemy Number One." In 1992 he founded The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, now recognized as the nation's top think/action tank on substance abuse involving tobacco, alcohol and illegal, prescription and performance enhancing drugs.It's hard to argue with Califano's thesis, that substance abuse is a huge, expensive and often tragic problem in the U.S., particularly when it affects children; best known for declaring cigarettes "public health enemy number one" as Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, Califano is clearly passionate, well-meaning and unafraid to think big: "We must end our denial, stamp out the stigma, rethink our concept of crime and punishment...to confront this plague." His sincerity and conviction is a two-edged sword, however: he comes off big-hearted one minute ("I am calling for...acceptance of such abuse and addiction as a chronic disease"), humorless and out of touch the next ("Movies like 40 Year Old Virgin and Wedding Crashers play excessive alcohol use for laughs"). And though he does take a chapter to address the "sharp edges" of marijuana use and warn against its (non-medical) legalization, he otherwise lumps all addictive substances into a single category; specificity goes instead into the details, costs and attendant statistics of (mostly failed) anti-abuse programs and legislation. Proposed solutions tend toward the general: more and better education, standardized professional training for therapists, eliminating tobacco and alcohol money from politics and "curbing availability and attractiveness." As a wonky primer to one culture warrior's approach to America's drug problem, this volume is informative, if familiar. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Raineys have six children and two grandchildren and live in Little Rock, Arkansas.The cofounders of FamilyLife, a branch of Campus Crusade for Christ, bring their insights to the matter of a faith-filled marriage in the latest installment of their Family First series, a 30-day prayer devotional designed for husbands and wives. "Praying together may be the single most important spiritual discipline you and your spouse will ever share," say the Raineys (Growing a Spiritually Strong Family and Moments Together for Couples). Using personal anecdotes as well as stories they&#x2019;ve encountered through their ministry, they propose that prayer with a spouse can reduce conflict, protect against divorce and even improve a couple&#x2019;s sex life. Each day of their devotional includes suggestions for prayer and a reflection section designed to spark deeper thought and discussion. Although geared toward marriages in which both partners are committed Christians, the book appropriately offers ideas for those whose spouses do not share their faith. From practical advice (how to pray) to spiritual generosity (prayers for the salvation of all people), this little volume offers readers warm encouragement in their prayer lives. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Little Man, Little Man: A Story of Childhood</h2><p>Four-year-old TJ spends his days on his lively Harlem block playing with his best friends WT and Blinky and running errands for neighbors. As he comes of age as a &#x201c;Little Man&#x201d; with big dreams, TJ faces a world of grown-up adventures and realities. Baldwin&#x2019;s only children&#x2019;s book, <i>Little Man, Little Man</i> celebrates and explores the challenges and joys of black childhood.<br><br> Now available for the first time in forty years, this new edition of <i>Little Man, Little Man</i>&#x2014;which retains the charming original illustrations by French artist Yoran Cazac&#x2014;includes a foreword by Baldwin&#x2019;s nephew Tejan "TJ"&nbsp;Karefa-Smart and an afterword by his niece Aisha Karefa-Smart, with an introduction by two Baldwin scholars. In it we not only see life in 1970s Harlem from a black child&#x2019;s perspective, but&nbsp;we also gain a fuller appreciation of the genius of one of America&#x2019;s greatest writers.</p><p>James Baldwin (1924&#x2013;1987), the world-famous novelist, playwright, essayist, critic, and public intellectual, was the grandson of a slave. He grew up in Harlem and was the oldest of nine children. He spent three years while in his teens as a preacher and briefly worked on the New Jersey railroad. In the 1940s he met his mentor, painter Beauford Delaney, and moved to Greenwich Village. In 1948 he left the United States and moved to Paris. His first novel&#x2014;<i>Go Tell It on the Mountain</i>&#x2014;was published in 1953, and over the next ten years he wrote many essays and several of his best-known works, including <i>Notes of a Native Son</i>, <i>Giovanni&#x2019;s Room</i>, and <i>The Fire Next Time</i>. During the 1960s Baldwin split his time between Istanbul and the United States, where he was active in the civil rights movement. In 1971 he moved to Saint Paul-de-Vence, a village in the south of France. There he wrote, among other works,<i> Little Man, Little Man</i>, which he dedicated to Beauford Delaney; and the novel <i>If Beale Street Could Talk</i>, which he dedicated to Yoran Cazac.<br><br> Yoran Cazac (1938&#x2013;2005) was a French artist who first gained attention for his abstract paintings in Paris in the 1960s. He moved to Rome, where he became the prot�g� of the painter Balthus, director of the French Academy. Cazac met Baldwin in Paris in 1959 through their mutual friend, painter Beauford Delaney. They rekindled their friendship in the 1970s, when Baldwin asked Cazac to provide the illustrations for <i>Little Man, Little Man</i>. Baldwin contributed an essay for the catalog of Cazac&#x2019;s 1977 exhibition at the Chateau de Maintenon. Cazac's final solo exhibition was held at the Kiron Gallery in Paris in 2003.<br><br> Nicholas Boggs is Clinical Assistant Professor of English at New York University.<br><br> Jennifer DeVere Brody is Professor of Theater and Performance Studies at Stanford University.<br><br> Tejan Karefa-Smart, James Baldwin&#x2019;s nephew, is a photographer and digital media artist who lives in Paris, France.<br><br> Aisha Karefa-Smart, James Baldwin&#x2019;s niece, is an author who lives in Washington, D.C."Pulled from the past, this is a brilliant exploration of black childhood with profound emotional depth, drawn from the grace and struggles of community and reinforcing the truth that no one knows Harlem like Baldwin." (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> 2018-06-15)<br><br>"You&#x2019;re getting everything through Baldwin&#x2019;s keen insights and distinctive voice. And it really is a beautiful read. The descriptions alone are worth the price of admission.... I think that maybe this is the book that kids need today.... [T]he book has aged amazingly well.... A new classic. Looks like the world finally caught up with it at last." (Elizabeth Bird <i>School Library Journal</i> 2018-05-21)<br><br>"French artist Cazac&#x2019;s scribbly-line spreads and vignettes, tinted with watercolor, seem charged with electricity. Through luminous prose and fine observation, readers come to care deeply about TJ and his friends, and they&#x2019;ll wish their story didn&#x2019;t end so soon." (<i>Publishers Weekly (Starred Review)</i> 2018-06-22)<br><br>&nbsp;"At 42, <i>Little Man, Little Man</i> has aged well. What might have been permanently dismissed . . . has instead matured into a timely representation of an urban African American childhood, presented in 'the black vernacular style of [Baldwin's] Harlem neighborhood,' made accessible once more to eager new audiences." (Terry Hong <i>Shelf Awareness</i> 2018-07-11)<br><br>&#x201c;Now that we have a children&#x2019;s book, we can start people off even younger. It&#x2019;s a book that young people can read or have read to them, but it&#x2019;s also a new Baldwin for adults.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (Jacqueline Woodson, quoted in the <i>New York Times</i> 2018-08-20)<br><br>"The watercolor images of Harlem &#x2014; which took shape from Baldwin&#x2019;s recollections, filtered through a French artist&#x2019;s imagination &#x2014; have a dreamlike, impressionist quality that can be almost jarring when juxtaposed with the sometimes menacing elements TJ confronts in his neighborhood." (Alexandra Alter <i>New York Times</i> 2018-08-20)<br><br>"Written for his nephew and out of print for 40 years, Baldwin's account of 4-year-old TJ's life in Harlem retains its power to enchant." (<i>People</i> 2018-08-27)<br><br>"A vivid perspective that is both moving and enriching . . . It is a story of childhood, from a particular time and place, captured in colloquial language that is freighted at once with innocence, pain and tenderness." (Meghan Cox Gurdon <i>Wall Street Journal</i> 2018-08-23)<br><br>"A book to study and discuss at length. . . . The story&#x2019;s profound depth stems from the implication that childhood innocence is a myth. Baldwin implies, as he does in his other work, that claiming innocence to racism (by adults and children alike) is a poor excuse for avoiding the difficult work required to grapple with it. Baldwin&#x2019;s story of childhood forces the reader to grapple." (Jenny Gapp <i>School Library Connection</i> 2018-11-01)<br><br>"A must-read for fans of Baldwin, for those with interest in historical perspectives, and for those seeking a compelling story that will endure."

Written originally in French in 1892 and ridiculed on its publication, translated into English by Lord Alfred Douglas ("Bosie" himself) and again heaped with scorn, it has survived for 75 years, served as the text (in abridged form) for Richard Strauss' world-famous opera, and emerged as an acknowledged masterwork of the Aesthetic movement of <i>fin de si�cle</i> England.<br>The illustrations that Aubrey Beardsley prepared for the first English edition have no less strange a story. Beardsley liked neither the play nor its author. Yet, it inspired some of his finest work. It is an open question as to how suited the drawings actually are to the text that Wilde wrote. Yet, the two, the play and the Beardsley illustrations, have nevertheless become so identified with each other as to be inseparable.<br>This edition reprints the first edition (1894) text, with "A Note on 'Salome'" by Robert Ross. The Beardsley drawings it superbly reproduces (mostly from a rare early portfolio) include not only the 10 full-page illustrations, the front and back cover designs, the title and List of Illustrations page decorations, and the <i>cul de lampe</i> from the original edition, but also three drawings that were not used, an alternate cover sketch, and the drawing entitled "<i>J'ai bais� ta bouche, Iokanaan,</i>" which Beardsley did earlier for <i>The Studio</i>. Furthermore, all of the illustrations are reproduced in their original state, not as expurgated in the first and most subsequent editions. </p></p><p></p><h2>Self Analysis</h2><p>To be completed</p><p>Karen Horney (1885-1952) was one of the most influential psychoanalysts of the twentieth century.

The problem, as Womack and Jones explain in <i>Lean Thinking,</i> is that managers have lost sight of value for the customer and how to create it. By focusing on their existing organizations and outdated definitions of value, managers create waste, and the economies of the advanced countries continue to stagnate. </p><p> What's needed instead is <i>lean thinking</i> to help managers clearly specify <i>value,</i> to line up all the value-creating activities for a specific product along a <i>value stream,</i> and to make value <i>flow</i> smoothly at the <i>pull</i> of the customer in pursuit of <i>perfection.</i> The first part of the book describes each of these concepts and makes them come alive with striking examples. </p><p> As <i>Lean Thinking</i> clearly demonstrates, these simple ideas can breathe new life into any company in any industry, routinely doubling both productivity and sales while stabilizing employment. But most managers will need guidance on how to make the lean leap in their firm. Part II provides a step-by-step action plan, based on in-depth studies of fifty lean companies in a wide range of industries across the world -- including Pratt &amp; Whitney, Porsche, and Toyota. </p><p> Even those readers who believe they have embraced lean thinking will discover in Part III that another dramatic leap is possible by creating a lean enterprise for each of their product families that tightly links all value-creating activities from concept to product launch, from order to delivery, and from raw materials into the arms of the consumer. This new concept takes the best features from the American, German, and Japanese industrial traditions and recombines them in a way that can be applied to every economic activity, from long-distance travel to construction to health care. </p><p> <i>Lean Thinking</i> does not provide a new management "program" for the one-minute manager. Instead, it offers a new way of thinking, being, and doing for the serious manager -- one that will change the world.</p></p><p>James P. Womack is an author, an adviser to North American firms making a lean leap, and an investor in a small manufacturing firm. He maintains a research affiliation with the Japan Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and lives in Brookline, Massachusetts.<p> <b>CHAPTER 1: Value</b> </p><p> <b>A House or a Hassle-Free Experience?</b> </p><p> Doyle Wilson of Austin, Texas, had been building homes for fifteen years before he got serious about quality. "In October of 1991 I just got disgusted. Such a large part of my business was waiting and rework, with expensive warranty claims and friction with customers, that I knew there must be a better way. Then I stumbled across the quality movement." </p><p> He read Carl Sewell's book on car dealing, <i>Customers for Life,</i> and decided to test his claims by buying a car at Sewell's Dallas dealership. ("I thought that if even a car dealer could make a customer feel good, it should be easy for a homebuilder!") His purchase was such a positive experience that he asked Sewell for advice on quality in home building and was told to read the works of W. Edwards Deming. </p><p> Doyle Wilson is the archetypical Texan and never does things halfway. By February of 1992 he had launched a wall-to-wall Total Quality Management campaign at Doyle Wilson Homebuilder. Over the next three years he personally taught his workforce the principles of TQM, began to collect and analyze enormous amounts of data on every aspect of his business, got rid of individual sales commissions ("which destroy quality consciousness"), eliminated the traditional "builder bonus" for his construction superintendents (who were qualifying for the "on-time completion" bonus by making side deals with customers on a "to-be-done-later" list), reduced his contractor corps by two thirds, and required the remaining contractors to attend (and pay for) his monthly quality seminars. </p><p> Customer surveys showed a steady rise in satisfaction with the homebuilding experience and sales grew steadily even in a fiat market as Wilson took sales from his competitors. In 1995, Doyle Wilson Homebuilder won the National Housing Quality Award (often called the Baldrige Award for quality of the construction industry), and Wilson set a goal of winning the Baldrige Award itself by 1998. Yet he was not satisfied. </p><p> "I knew I was making progress in competing with other builders for the new-home buyer, but a simple fact, once it lodged in my mind, wouldn't go away: 78 percent of the homes bought in central Texas each year are 'used' or older homes, l've been making progress in increasing my share of the 22 percent seeking a new home, but what about the 78 percent who bought older homes? Obviously, these buyers are the real market opportunity." </p><p> So instead of surveying people who were buying new homes, Wilson began to talk with people who were buying older homes. What he discovered was obvious in retrospect but has required a complete rethinking of his business. Specifically, he found that many buyers of older homes hated the "hassle factor" in negotiating for new construction, the long lead times to get the job done and move in, the inevitable "to-be-done" list after moving in, and the "phony choices" available from builders who promise custom homes but then load on as "standard equipment" many features of little interest to buyers. </p><p> Wilson soon realized that that was exactly what he had been asking his customers to go through. By contrast, older-home customers could clearly see what they were getting, buy only what they wanted, and, often, move in immediately. "No wonder I was losing 78 percent of my potential customers!" </p><p> To create a hassle-free experience to go with the house itself (these together constituting Wilson's "product"), it was necessary to rethink every step in the process. He has recently opened a one-stop sales center where the customer can see and decide on every option available in a house (for example, the forty different varieties of brick, the three thousand varieties of wallpaper, the four styles of built-in home office), customize a basic design with the help of an Auto-Cad computer system, select features beyond the standard level (for example, extra-thick carpet pads, additional outdoor lighting, and heavier-duty wiring), determine the exact price, work out the mortgage, arrange for insurance, and arrange for the title search. For customers truly in a hurry this can be done during one walk-through of the sales center. </p><p> To shrink the lead rime from contract signing to moving in from six months to a target of thirty days, he has reorganized his contract-writing and job-release process and is developing a system of pull scheduling for contractors who are assigned new jobs as downstream jobs are completed. He is also introducing standardized work statements, parts lists, and tool kits for every job. Eventually these steps will eliminate the "to-do" list because the new system does not allow the next task to start until the previous task is certified as complete with perfect quality. </p><p> Finally, Wilson has created a wide range of basic house designs with a minimum construction standard and asks the customer to specify all materials and systems upgrades (using the computer design system) to a selected base design so the customer only pays for exactly what she or he feels is really needed. </p><p> Doing all of this will not be easy, as we'll see when we return to this example in Chapter 3 on flow, but Doyle Wilson has already made the key leap. Instead of concentrating on conventional markets and what he and his contractors were accustomed to making in a conventional way, he has looked hard at <i>value</i> as defined by his customers and set off down a new path. </p><p> <b>Start by Challenging Traditional Definitions of "Value"</b> </p><p> Why is it so hard to start at the right place, to correctly define value? Partly because most producers want to make what they are already making and partly because many customers only know how to ask for some variant of what they are already getting. They simply start in the wrong place and end up at the wrong destination. Then, when providers or customers do decide to rethink value, they often fall back on simple formulas -- lower cost, increased product variety through customization, instant delivery -- rather than jointly analyzing value and challenging old definitions to see what's really needed. </p><p> Steve Maynard, vice president for engineering and product development at the Wiremold Company in West Hartford, Connecticut, was trying to deal with these very problems when he reorganized Wiremold's product development system in 1992. For many years previously, Wiremold had developed new products -- consisting of wire guides for office and industrial users and surge protectors for PCs and other business electronics -- through a conventional departmentalized process. It started with marketing, which commissioned surveys comparing Wiremold's products with the offerings of competitors. When an "opportunity" was identified, usually a gap in the market or a reported weakness in a competitor's offering, a design was developed by product engineering, then tested by the prototype group. If it worked according to specification, the design proceeded to the engineers designing the machines to make the products and eventually went into production. </p><p> This system produced designs which lacked imagination and which customers often ignored. (The designs also took too much rime and effort to develop and cost too much to make, but these are a different type of problem we'll discuss in Chapter 3.) Simply speeding up this process through simultaneous engineering and then broadening product variety would just have brought more bad designs to market faster. Pure <i>muda.</i> </p><p> Steve Maynard's solution was to forma team for each product to stick with that product during its entire production life. This team -- consisting of a marketer, a product engineer, and a tooling/process engineer -- proceeded to enter into a <i>dialogue</i> with leading customers (major contractors) in which all of the old products and solutions were ignored. Instead, the customer and the producer (Wiremold</p></p><h2>The Art of Drawing</h2><p>This third edition of THE ART OF DRAWING focuses on the latest developments in the author&#39;s drawing classes, which began at the Yale School of Art in 1951.

Armed Vessel Bounty</h2><p>&#34;Captain Bligh&#34; is a cliche of our times for the extravagant and violent misuse of power. In fact, William Bligh was one of the least physically violent disciplinarians in the British navy. That paradox inspires the author to ask why, then, did Bligh have a mutiny? Its answer is to display the theatricality of naval institutions and the mythologizing power of history. Mr Bligh&#39;s Bad Language is an anthropological and historical study of the mutiny on the Bounty, and its role in society and culture. Throughout the book, Greg Dening draws on a wide range of intellectual influences, ending with the cinematic versions of the mutiny in the twentieth century.</p><p>William Bligh was one of the least physically violent disciplinarians in the British Navy, why, then, did he have a mutiny? Mr Bligh&#39;s Bad Language is a study of the mutiny on the Bounty, and its role in society and culture. Greg Dening draws on a wide range of influences, including modern cinematic portrayals.Captain Bligh and the voyage of the Bounty are the starting point of this new study of the famous mutiny in history, literature and film. By juxtaposing an account of the mutiny with an analysis of its evolving place in history and culture, Mr. Bligh&#39;s Bad Language offers a new interpretation of the mutiny in the context of its historical and cultural representations. Beginning with an analysis of naval life and ritual aboard the Bounty, Greg Dening argues that the famous mutiny did not take place due to punitive violence, as Captain Bligh is shown to be one of the least violent of British Navy captains. Instead, he argues, Captain Bligh misunderstood the theatrical nature of shipboard life, especially his role as captain. Moving to a larger stage, the scope of the book shifts to the reception of the mutiny in England in the eighteenth century. Connecting the voyage of the Bounty with the cultural exploration and revolutions of the age, Greg Dening shows that a mythology arose almost immediately around the participants of the mutiny and their actions, a mythology that has been continually reinterpreted into twentieth century literature and film. Gracefully written, Mr. Bligh&#39;s Bad Language is an anthropological history of a new order, weaving the history of the Bounty with its role in our culture. Using a range of influences from Diderot to Foucault, Greg Dening reconstructs the voyage of the Bounty as moving between history and mythology, circumventing a dozen discourses.</p><h2>Developing Your Theoretical Orientation in Counseling and Psychotherapy</h2><p>Developing Your Theoretical Orientation in Counseling and Psychotherapy provides therapists-in-training with tools, strategies, and activities to formulate their response to the age-old question, &#34;What&#39;s your theoretical orientation?&#34; The underpinnings of counseling and psychotherapy are based in its theoretical foundation.

Most attempts to translate the Bible into contemporary English fall flat because they're blatantly agenda-driven or because they rescue the Gospels from limp Victorian prose only to encrust them in awkward contemporary jargon. <i>The Acts of Jesus</i>, by contrast, listens closely to the Greek styles of the Original texts, then renders each distinctive voice in modern English. Consequently, Luke sounds like a good college English professor, but Mark sounds rougher, like street language. The text is color-coded--words in red indicate events that the translators believe to have actually taken place, for instance--and the volume also includes exhaustive commentary and indices by the members of the Jesus Seminar. Only the heartiest of readers will make use of all this auxiliary information. For most of us, the freshness of the language ("You scholars and Pharisees, you impostors! Damn you! You slam the door of Heaven's domain in people's faces.") is the most valuable discovery in <i>The Acts of Jesus.</i> <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Robert W.

For women who want an alternative, choice is often unavailable: Midwives are sometimes inaccessible; in eleven states they are illegal. In one of those states, even birthing centers are outlawed.When did birth become an emergency instead of an emergence? Since when is normal, physiological birth a crime? A groundbreaking journalistic narrative, <i>Pushed</i> presents the complete picture of maternity care in America. Crisscrossing the country to report what women really experience during childbirth, Jennifer Block witnessed several births - from a planned cesarean to an underground home birth. Against this backdrop, Block investigates whether routine C-sections, inductions, and epidurals equal medical progress. She examines childbirth as a reproductive rights issue: Do women have the right to an optimal birth experience? If so, is that right being upheld? Block's research and experience reveal in vivid detail that while emergency obstetric care is essential, there is compelling evidence that we are overusing medical technology at the expense of maternal and infant health: Either women's bodies are failing, or the system is failing women.</p><p><b>Jennifer Block</b> is a former editor at <i>Ms. Magazine</i> and an editor of the revised <i>Our Bodies, Ourselves</i>. Her work has appeared in <i>The Nation</i>, <i>Mother Jones</i>, and <i>Elle</i>. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.According to writer and editor Block (Our Bodies, Ourselves), "the United States has the most intense and widespread medical management of birth" in the world, and yet "ranks near the bottom among industrialized countries in maternal and infant mortality." Block shows how, in transforming childbirth into a business, hospitals have turned "procedures and devices developed for the treatment of abnormality" into routine practice, performed for no reason than "speeding up and ordering an unpredictable...process"; for instance, the U.S. cesarean section rate tripled in the 1970s, and has doubled since then. Block looks into a growing contingent of parents-to-be exploring alternatives to the hospital-and the attendant likelihood of medical intervention-by seeking out birthing centers and options for home-birth. Unfortunately, obstacles to these alternatives remain considerable-laws across the U.S. criminalizing or severely restricting the practice of midwifery have led the trained care providers to practice underground in many states-while tort reform has done next to nothing to lower malpractice insurance rates or improve hospital birthing policies. This provocative, highly readable expose raises questions of great consequence for anyone planning to have a baby in U.S., as well as those interested or involved in women's health care. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her work has been featured in numerous publications, including <i>American Artist</i>, <i>The Artist's Magazine</i>, and <i>American Art Collector</i>. Nickelsen's paintings have been exhibited and won awards in prestigious national and international juried shows, such as Salmagundi Club, the American Artist Professional League, Audubon Artists, and the Colored Pencil Society of America. She is the creator and instructor of the Colored Pencil Painting Learning Center hosted on her website, www.brushandpencil.com.<b>From the Introduction:</b><br><br> The colored pencils in my studio are amazingly resilient. They have successfully outlasted the many temptations presented by paints, pastels, inks, etc., and, umpteen years later, still hold the preferred position on my work table. I have used the vast quantity of accumulated knowledge about the properties of other mediums and incorporated the more useful ones to further advance and extend the benefits of the colored pencil painting process. <br><br>Through continuous research, experiments, and testing, the exceptionality of the colored pencil medium has become clear to me. Their precision and flexibility allows artists to achieve practically any desired effect. We simply need to understand their much overlooked properties and use them to our own advantage. As a result, even the sometimes cumbersome task of covering a large background is no longer a chore. If you know how, you can overcome such challenges in just a fraction of the time you may have come to expect. <br><br>In this book we continue the discussion started in Colored Pencil Painting Bible about the colored pencil painting process. However, this time it will be based on the example of the portrait genre. Since the publication of my first book some of the techniques I use today have been updated or modified, some tools were added and others abandoned, and some ideas have been adopted or rejected. But the fundamentals of my approach remain the same. I continue layering colored pencils onto a white surface producing finished artwork that resembles a painting rather than a drawing. We will be discussing all aspects of these practices in detail throughout the pages of this work.</p><h2>The Ancient Hebrew Lexicon of the Bible</h2><p>All previous Biblical Hebrew lexicons have provided a modern western definition and perspective to Hebrew roots and words. This prevents the reader of the Bible from seeing the ancient authors&#39; original intent of the passages. This is the first Biblical Hebrew lexicon that defines each Hebrew word within its original Ancient Hebrew cultural meaning. One of the major differences between the Modern Western mind and the Ancient Hebrew&#39;s is that their mind related all words and their meanings to a concrete concept. For instance, the Hebrew word &#34;chai&#34; is normally translated as &#34;life&#34;, a western abstract meaning, but the original Hebrew concrete meaning of this word is the &#34;stomach&#34;. In the Ancient Hebrew mind, a full stomach is a sign of a full &#34;life&#34;. The Hebrew language is a root system oriented language and the lexicon is divided into sections reflecting this root system. Each word of the Hebrew Bible is grouped within its roots and is defined according to its original ancient cultural meaning. Also included in each word entry are its alternative spellings, King James translations of the word and Strong&#39;s number. Indexes are included to assist with finding a word within the lexicon according to its spelling, definition, King James translation or Strong&#39;s number.</p><p>As the Bible was written in an ancient Near East culture it is imperative that the Bible be read from this perspective, not from a modern western one. This lexicon revolutionizes how we read the Bible and is designed to reveal insights into the Ancient Hebrew text of the Bible as never before seen.When Mr. Benner first began reading the Hebrew text of the Bible he quickly discovered that the Ancient Hebrews did not think in the same manner we do and realized that we should not be reading the Biblical text as if we were reading a modern Novel. Mr. Benner founded the "Ancient Hebrew Research Center" in 1999 in order to promote and teach the Ancient Hebrew language, culture and thought to those interested in learning how to read the Bible from an Ancient Hebrew perspective. Mr. Benner is also the author of several books related to the study of the Ancient Hebrew language and thought including <i>Learn to Read Biblical Hebrew</i>, <i>The Ancient Hebrew Language and Alphabet</i> and <i>His Name is One</i>.</p><h2>Exploring Chemical Analysis</h2><p><i>Exploring Chemical Analysis</i> provides an ideal one-term text for both chemistry majors and non-majors.

It lies at the core of chemistry and embodies the most fundamental principles of the field. The one definitive text on the development of the periodic table by van Spronsen (1969), has been out of print for a considerable time. The present book provides a successor to van Spronsen, but goes further in giving an evaluation of the extent to which modern physics has, or has not, explained the periodic system. The book is written in a lively style to appeal to experts and interested lay-persons alike.<br> <br> <em>The Periodic Table</em> begins with an overview of the importance of the periodic table and of the elements and it examines the manner in which the term 'element' has been interpreted by chemists and philosophers. The book then turns to a systematic account of the early developments that led to the classification of the elements including the work of Lavoisier, Boyle and Dalton and Cannizzaro. The precursors to the periodic system, like D�bereiner and Gmelin, are discussed. In chapter 3 the discovery of the periodic system by six independent scientists is examined in detail. <br> <br> Two chapters are devoted to the discoveries of Mendeleev, the leading discoverer, including his predictions of new elements and his accommodation of already existing elements. Chapters 6 and 7 consider the impact of physics including the discoveries of radioactivity and isotopy and successive theories of the electron including Bohr's quantum theoretical approach. Chapter 8 discusses the response to the new physical theories by chemists such as Lewis and Bury who were able to draw on detailed chemical knowledge to correct some of the early electronic configurations published by Bohr and others.<br> <br> Chapter 9 provides a critical analysis of the extent to which modern quantum mechanics is, or is not, able to explain the periodic system from first principles. Finally, chapter 10 considers the way that the elements evolved following the Big Bang and in the interior of stars. The book closes with an examination of further chemical aspects including lesser known trends within the periodic system such as the knight's move relationship and secondary periodicity, as well at attempts to explain such trends.<br></p><p>Pre-Publication Reviews. <p>"Written to a high standard of scholarship, "The Periodic Table" is the only book of its kind currently on the market, giving both an historical and philosophical perspective to the development of this key to the elements. The philosophical discussion Scerri weaves through its pages is rarely found in chemistry books, giving it a special quality that will appeal to the scientific community at large. In years to come it will be seen as essential reading for all who aspire to lecture and write on the subject." - John Emsley, author of "The Elements" and "Nature's Building Blocks" </p><p> "As the author of "The Periodic System of Chemical Elements: A History of the First Hundred Years" (1969), I consider Scerri's "The Periodic Table: Its Story and Its Significance" a worthy successor. I declare his new book a must, not only for all historians of chemistry and the other natural sciences, but also for the scientists and pupils thereof." -- Jan W. van Spronsen, author of "The Periodic System of Chemical Elements: A History of the First Hundred Years" "Few concepts are more important in chemistry than the periodic table, and Eric Scerri's book offers a wonderfully thorough, lucid, and provocative introduction for both chemists and the scientifically literate to this major cultural contribution. Anyone interested in the foundations of chemistry will take delight, inspiration, and information from this highly approachable book." - Peter Atkins, author of "The Periodic Kingdom", "Molecules" etc. </p><p> "The periodic table of elements is the family tree of stuff, and Eric Scerri's book tells the story of its evolution--through all the false starts and inspired insights, mutations and selections, driven by philosophy as much as calculation. Like any family story, it's a messy tangle of relationships--between elementary particles and between people. The ultimate question is philosophical: Does it all boil down to different configurations of hydrogen? Or is chemistry--and therefore nature--ultimately irreducible?" -K.C. Cole, Author of "The Universe and the Teacup: The Mathematics of Truth and Beauty" and "Mind Over Matter: Conversations with the Cosmos".</p>My first solo book. &nbsp;I'm so glad it's been so well received. &nbsp;I would be delighted to answer any questions from readers. &nbsp;Please also see my website at&nbsp;ericscerri.com</p><h2>Remember the Time: Protecting Michael Jackson in His Final Days</h2><p><b>A compellingly candid memoir that details Jackson's life in seclusion, by the bodyguards who were with him in his final days</b><b> - with a new introduction to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Michael Jackson's death .</b><br>Hounded by the tabloid media, driven from his self-made sanctuary, Neverland, Michael Jackson spent his final years moving from city to city, living with his three children in virtual seclusion - a futile attempt to escape a world that wouldn't leave him alone.

Index</p><h2>The Innocents Abroad (Wordsworth Classics)</h2><p>With an Introduction by Stuart Hutchinson. Who could read the programme for the excursion without longing to make one of the party? So Mark Twain acclaims his voyage from New York City to Europe and the Holy Land in June 1867. His adventures produced The Innocents Abroad, a book so funny and provocative it made him an international star for the rest of his life. He was making his first responses to the Old World - to Paris, Milan, Florence, Venice, Pompeii, Constantinople, Sebastopol, Balaklava, Damascus, Jerusalem, Nazareth, and Bethlehem. For the first time he was seeing the great paintings and sculptures of the Old Masters . He responded with wonder and amazement, but also with exasperation, irritation, disbelief. Above all he displayed the great energy of his humour, more explosive for us now than for his beguiled contemporaries.</p><p>14 1.5-hour cassettesThe Innocents Abroad is one of the most prominent and influential travel books ever written about Europe and the Holy Land. In it, the collision of the American &#34;New Barbarians&#34; and the European &#34;Old World&#34; provides much comic fodder for Mark Twain--and a remarkably perceptive lens on the human condition. Gleefully skewering the ethos of American tourism in Europe, Twain&#39;s lively satire ultimately reveals just what it is that defines cultural identity. As Twain himself points out, &#34;Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one&#39;s lifetime.&#34; And Jane Jacobs observes in her Introduction, &#34;If the reader is American, he may also find himself on a tour of his own psyche.&#34;</p><h2>The Writer&#39;s Guide to Everyday Life in the Wild West (WRITER&#39;S GUIDE TO EVERYDAY LIFE SERIES)</h2><p>Provides period information on clothes and accessories, food, architecture, medicine, education, communications, crime, and money</p><p></p><h2>Intimate Allies</h2><p>This book cuts through our cultural expectations of marriage and pierces to the heart of issues such as leadership, submission, conflict, disappointments, gender differences, roles, sexuality, and shared service. This is a fresh look at God&#39;s design for the marriage relationship.</p><p></p><h2>The Quantum Theory of Fields (The Quantum Theory of Fields 3 Volume Hardback Set) (Volume 1)</h2><p>In The Quantum Theory of Fields, Nobel Laureate Steven Weinberg combines his exceptional physical insight with his gift for clear exposition to provide a self-contained, comprehensive, and up-to-date introduction to quantum field theory. This is a two-volume work. Volume I introduces the foundations of quantum field theory. The development is fresh and logical throughout, with each step carefully motivated by what has gone before, and emphasizing the reasons why such a theory should describe nature. After a brief historical outline, the book begins anew with the principles about which we are most certain, relativity and quantum mechanics, and the properties of particles that follow from these principles. Quantum field theory emerges from this as a natural consequence. The author presents the classic calculations of quantum electrodynamics in a thoroughly modern way, showing the use of path integrals and dimensional regularization. His account of renormalization theory reflects the changes in our view of quantum field theory since the advent of effective field theories. The book&#39;s scope extends beyond quantum electrodynamics to elementary particle physics, and nuclear physics.

And let&#x2019;s just be honest: we are in a bad way, generally speaking. I say, "generally speaking," because there are some blacks who are not doing badly at all. But the black community, in general, is not doing that well. You don&#x2019;t believe that? Just read the newspaper: we&#x2019;re killing one another, robbing our parents and grandparents, raping our women, selling death to the dying, going to jail wholesale, murdering our babies, not taking care of our responsibilities and wiping out our future.Why are we sinking in the sea of murder, drugs and mayhem? How can things be turned around? I believe that the problem lies largely with the black man, and I also believe that the solution lies with the black man. I am convinced that the key to turning black America around is to turn black men around. For any group of people to rise, their men must rise. And after they have risen, they must stay standing no matter what, and take their God-given position as the leaders of their families, churches, communities or what have you. These letters aim to help with that rising and standing.These letters have been written in the midst of a very hectic schedule of traveling, editing an international publication, and working on several other publishing projects. These letters have also been written in the midst of being a black man, and a black husband and father, with all of the great and awful experiences that go with such an existence.I said that to say this: As I write these letters, I am not in some ivory tower somewhere philosophizing about life as a young black man. Rather, I am right in the middle of life as a young black man. In short, these letters come from a sincere heart of a black man to the hearts of young black men.Dear Y.B.M. (Please note that Y.B.M. will stand for "Young Black Man" throughout the book): I believe that this is a book that can absolutely revolutionize your life if you will let it. See this book as a sign-post on the road of life, pointing you in the right direction. Read it, read it again, and then pass it on to another young black man struggling to find his way in this sometimes confusing and hostile world.Daniel Whyte III Tuskegee University CampusTuskegee, Alabama</p><h2>Python for Finance: Analyze Big Financial Data</h2><p><p>The financial industry has adopted Python at a tremendous rate recently, with some of the largest investment banks and hedge funds using it to build core trading and risk management systems.

Why did an entirely new social institution, the coffeehouse, emerge as the primary place for consumption of this new drink? In this lively book, Brian Cowan locates the answers to these questions in the particularly British combination of curiosity, commerce, and civil society. Cowan provides the definitive account of the origins of coffee drinking and coffeehouse society, and in so doing he reshapes our understanding of the commercial and consumer revolutions in Britain during the long Stuart century. </p><p>Britain&#x2019;s virtuosi, gentlemanly patrons of the arts and sciences, were profoundly interested in things strange and exotic. Cowan explores how such virtuosi spurred initial consumer interest in coffee and invented the social template for the first coffeehouses. As the coffeehouse evolved, rising to take a central role in British commercial and civil society, the virtuosi were also transformed by their own invention.</p></p><p><p><b>Brian Cowan</b> holds the Canada Research Chair in Early Modern British History at McGill University.

"I am an antichrist!" shouted singer Johnny Rotten--where in the world of pop music did that come from? Looking for an answer, with a high sense of the drama of the journey, Marcus takes us down the dark paths of counterhistory, a route of blasphemy, adventure, and surprise. </p><p> This is no mere search for cultural antecedents. Instead, what Marcus so brilliantly shows is that various kinds of angry, absolute demands--demands on society, art, and all the governing structures of everyday life--seem to be coded in phrases, images, and actions passed on invisibly, but inevitably, by people quite unaware of each other. Marcus lets us hear strange yet familiar voices: of such heretics as the Brethren of the Free Spirit in medieval Europe and the Ranters in seventeenth-century England; the dadaists in Zurich in 1916 and Berlin in 1918, wearing death masks, chanting glossolalia; one Michel Mourre, who in 1950 took over Easter Mass at Notre-Dame to proclaim the death of God; the Lettrist International and the Situationist International, small groups of Paris--based artists and writers surrounding Guy Debord, who produced blank-screen films, prophetic graffiti, and perhaps the most provocative social criticism of the 1950s and '60s; the rioting students and workers of May '68, scrawling cryptic slogans on city walls and bringing France to a halt; the Sex Pistols in London, recording the savage "Anarchy in the U.K." and "God Save the Queen." </p><p> Although the Sex Pistols shape the beginning and the end of the story, <i>Lipstick Traces</i> is not a book about music; it is about a common voice, discovered and transmitted in many forms. Working from scores of previously unexamined and untranslated essays, manifestos, and filmscripts, from old photographs, dada sound poetry, punk songs, collages, and classic texts from Marx to Henri Lefebvre, Marcus takes us deep behind the acknowledged events of our era, into a hidden tradition of moments that would seem imaginary except for the fact that they are real: a tradition of shared utopias, solitary refusals, impossible demands, and unexplained disappearances. Written with grace and force, humor and an insistent sense of tragedy and danger, <i>Lipstick Traces</i> tells a story as disruptive and compelling as the century itself. </p></p><p>Greil Marcus is the author of <i>The Doors</i>, <i>Mystery Train</i>, and other books.Greil Marcus's absorbing new study...dips in and out of the history of the Great Refusal, all the way from the medieval Lollards and Brethren of the Free Spirit to the Dadaists, the French Situationists, the Children of the May 1968 uprising in France and British punk rockers. <i>Lipstick Traces</i>, however, is no sedate academic record of libertarian revolt but a bold blending of anecdote, personal confession and cultural analysis, cutting backward and forward from Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols to the Surrealists, from Alexander Trocchi of the 1950's avant-garde group know as Lettrist International to George Grosz, from the Anabaptists in the 16th century to Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Danny the Red of the French student rebellion...[Marcus's] book is impressively adept at bringing alive some of the dramatic moments of the history it charts...A coruscatingly original piece of work, vibrant with the energy of the bizarre happenings it maps out.<br> --Terry Eagleton (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br><i>Lipstick Traces</i> has the energy of its obsessions, and it snares you in the manner of those intense, questing and often stoned sessions of intellectual debate you may have experienced in your college years. It was destined, in other words, to achieve cult status.<br> --Ben Brantley (<i>New York Times</i> 2001-05-11)<br><br>A book about the twilight zone of art and revolution...[that] displays an intellectual confidence, or nerve, that more than convinces the reader to follow its unmarked trails.<br> --Gail Caldwell (<i>Boston Globe</i>)<br><br>A cultural history of society's anarchic fringe. (<i>New York Times</i>)<br><br><i>Lipstick Traces</i>...is a highly subjective account of rebellious gestures that recur from decade to decade, often in remarkably similar incarnations. Marcus doesn't belabor the division between high and low--he just ignores it, fluidly shifting from (sometimes obscure) source to source. Dada leads to punk leads to Police Academy, and Elvis movies prompt analyses of the Left Bank. Natch! That Marcus can kick off and end his exhaustive, but always clear-headed, cross-epochal trek with the Sex Pistols--and make it all cohere--is but one indication of how fully he meshes the academy and the gutter.<br> --Katherine Dieckmann (<i>Voice Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>[A] seminal work...The impact of Marcus' work is undeniable...Though his imagination may overreach, his sentences may befuddle, his aims may elude his means (but not often), Marcus as a critic, historian and essayist continues to be at the vanguard of his field precisely because of his ability to find the balance between these approaches, between mystery and proposition, between a yarn and an epic, between yearning and compromise--an equilibrium which gives voice to the present moment of our looking back.<br> --Robert Loss (<i>popmatters.com</i> 2010-02-03)</p><h2>History of My Life, Vols. 11 &amp; 12</h2><p><p>The last two volumes of Casanova's account of his extraordinary life include the story of his imprisonment in Buen Retiro, his trip to Madrid and his affair with Do�a Ignacia, his journey to Barcelona and his detention in the Tower, his encounter with Lord Baltimore, and his serious illness in Aix-en-Provence when he is taken care of by a mysterious woman who turns out to the servant of one of his first loves, Henriette.</p></p><p><p>The complete memoirs of Casanova&#x2015;available for the first time in paperback.</p><p><b>Giacomo Casanova </b> was born in Venice in 1725.

In the face of conflict we focus only on facts--who&#x2019;s at fault and who should be punished--rather than seeking to restore harmony. But conflict is inevitable and presents an opportunity to establish deeper connections with others. By learning to speak honestly and listen devoutly, we can overcome our culture&#x2019;s hierarchical and punitive approach to conflict. We can learn to relate to each other in a sacred manner and create relationships and communities that are egalitarian, liberating, and transformational. <br> <br>Revealing that we are all peacemakers at heart, Steve Beyer details how to approach life with a listening heart and create a safe and sacred space for communication: the peacemaking circle, centered on the talking stick. Whoever holds the talking stick gets to speak. There are no interruptions, no questions, no challenges, no comments. People speak one at a time, honestly from their hearts, and they listen devoutly with their hearts to each person who speaks. And, as Beyer shows, the effect can be miraculous. <br> <br>The author explains how to apply this practice with groups large and small to deepen relationships, heal old wounds, and restore harmony among families, spouses, classmates, coworkers, and communities. Sharing stories from his work as a peacemaker, he offers exercises for new talking stick circles, ceremonial ways to begin each circle, and tools to ensure the telling of complete stories in cases of conflict. He addresses the nature of apology, forgiveness, and the urge for revenge, and he explores the spiritual challenges faced by those who walk the peace path. <br> <br>Exploring the shamanic roots of the talking stick practice, the author extends the lessons of the healing circle and the listening heart from our homes, schools, and communities into our relationship to spirit and the Earth.</p><p>Stephan V. Beyer, Ph.D., J.D., is a well-known writer and speaker on shamanism and spirituality. He is also a community builder, peacemaker, and carrier of council. He has been trained and certified in many areas of circle processes, mediation, and nonviolence and has offered peacemaking workshops to a wide variety of audiences, from therapists to theologians, and at Montessori, charter, alternative, and public schools. He has served as a Lecturer in the Department of Criminal Justice at Chicago State University, teaching undergraduate courses and graduate seminars in restorative justice and in the theory and practice of nonviolent resistance. He lives in Chicago.<b>Chapter 3 <br> <br>The Components of Council <br> <br>CIRCLE <br> <br></b>There are three simple things that make council special as a way of meeting together, making decisions, solving problems, dealing with conflicts, and building community. <br> <br>Sitting in a circle <br> <br>Beginning and ending with a ceremony <br> <br>Using a talking stick <br> <br>Sitting in a circle is the first of these. There are practical reasons for sitting in a circle. Everyone can see everyone else. No one is in front, and no one can hide in the back. But the circle is symbolic as well. The circle indicates the equality of all who sit together. There is no head of the table. Everyone&#x2019;s voice carries as much weight as the voice of everyone else. Everyone is out front, equally accountable for their words. <br> <br>The world is filled with circles. The sun is a circle; the moon becomes a circle over and over again--that is, in a cycle, a circle. For most of our history, humans have lived, not in the square sharp-cornered containers in which we live now, but rather in circular houses, often explicitly homologized to a circular cosmos. The year and its seasons go in a circle. Our lives go in a circle. We all follow in the footsteps of our elders and teachers who have gone before us; I am getting old now, but I have grandchildren who are coming after me. <br> <br>And the circle binds us to our ancestors. Whoever you are, wherever your people came from, whatever the color of your skin, your ancestors sat in a circle to meet together, make decisions, solve problems, deal with conflicts, and sing the songs and tell the stories that sustained and nurtured their communities. <br> <br>Most important, sitting in a circle creates a special space--a safe space, what many indigenous people would call a <i>sacred space</i>. The council circle takes place in a special space that differs from our ordinary space. In the sacred space of council it is possible to speak honestly without embarrassment; it is a place where confidences are kept; it is where decisions are made and peacemaking takes place. This is the space inside the circle, within which people listen to each other devoutly and give each other the courage to speak honestly from their hearts. This space is very different from the space outside the circle--a space where people interrupt each other, do not listen to each other, are rude to each other. <br> <br>The next time you attend a meeting--a business meeting for example--observe how people behave. People arrive with their opinions already formed, and may carry with them notes of their talking points, so that they do not forget to say something they think is important. People interrupt each other. People shift about impatiently while others are speaking. <br> <br>People do not pause after someone has finished speaking, to show that they are thinking about what that person has said. Instead, people start speaking immediately after someone has finished--indeed, not just when someone has finished, but even when someone simply pauses to take a breath or think about what to say next. The loudest or most aggressive talkers dominate the meeting; shy people may get no opportunity to speak at all. <br> <br>That is how people act <i>out there</i>, outside the sacred circle. But <i>inside </i>the council circle, where we can all see each other, where we take turns speaking, we create a space that is filled with respect and receptivity for what everyone has to say. Inside this circle, we create a sacred space--a space that is safe for speaking, because it is a space for listening. Take a deep breath. Inside the circle, we are home. <br> <br>There are a number of ways to demarcate the separate and sacred nature of the council space. The council may be held in a special place--a grove of trees, by the bank of a river, on top of a large rock, in a cave. A number of classrooms that use council have a <i>peace table</i> in one corner. This special place for peacemaking might also have a way of marking the number of times that the place has seen friendships renewed and breaches healed--marks on a stick, a pile of stones--that makes the table into a place of power. <br> <br>In a circle, too, the gaze of all the participants is naturally oriented not only toward whoever is speaking but also toward the center of the circle. The sacred nature of the circle can be enhanced by making an altar or <i>council table</i> at the center. Making the altar can be a rotating responsibility among the participants, or the altar can be made by those who are moved to do so on any particular occasion. Again, there are numerous variations. The altar can contain flowers, stones, fallen leaves, feathers, or branches that have been gathered before the council. An altar of special significance can be made by each participant placing in the center an object that has personal meaning or that symbolizes the issues to be discussed at council. <br> <br>Or, again, if council is held outdoors and especially for evening councils, the center can be marked by a fire--not the cooking fire, but a special and separate fire. There is something primal about sharing the warmth and light of a fire in the darkness. The glowing fire, the sense of safety, the intimacy and privacy of the darkness seem to lead people to share more of their secret selves than they might do in the harsher daylight. The fire represents a deep and centered place, the heart of everything, the unity for which the circle strives. <br> <br>But most important is this. <i>Any time you listen devoutly to another, you have created a sacred space.</i> The circle exists wherever people hold the intention of sitting in council together. Two people can be in council; you can be in council with yourself.</p><h2>The Divine Comedy (Leather-bound Classics) (2013) Leather Bound</h2><p>&#x201c;O human race, born to fly upward, wherefore at a little wind dost thou so fall?&#x201d;<br><br>Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso--the three fates of the deceased become the three pillars of an epic poem. <i>The Divine Comedy</i>, written by Italian poet Dante Alighieri in the fourteenth century, is considered the foremost work in Italian literature. The journey begins with Dante&#x2019;s descent into the depths of Hell where he witnesses those eternally separated from God.&nbsp;Then he climbs the mountain of Purgatory where Christian souls undergo final purification, before finally touring the celestial circles of Heaven where he is filled with the image of God.&nbsp;An allegorical work, the comedy is representative of the soul&#x2019;s journey towards God.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> <br>&nbsp;<br> <br>Influential for seven centuries, this classic is a must have for lovers of great literature, and the luxurious leather-bound edition from Canterbury Classics will make a stunning addition to any library.&nbsp;</p><p>Dante Alighieri's poetic masterpiece, The Divine Comedy, is a moving human drama, an unforgettable visionary journey through the infinite torment of Hell, up the arduous slopes of Purgatory, and on to the glorious realm of Paradise-the sphere of universal harmony and eternal salvation.<p> One of the greatest works in literature, Dantes story-poem is an allegory that represents mankind as it exposes itself, by its merits or demerits, to the rewards or the punishments of justice. A single listening will reveal Dantes visual imagination and uncanny power to make the spiritual visible.</p>This story begins in a shadowed forest on Good Friday in the year of our Lord 1300. It proceeds on a journey that, in its intense re-creation of the depths and the heights of human experience, has become the key with which Western civilization has sought to unlock the mystery of its own identity.</p><h2>50 Instructional Routines to Develop Content Literacy (2nd Edition)</h2><p><p>From some of the best-known authors in the field comes a book that provides all middle and high school teachers with practical information about improving students&#x2019; reading, writing, and oral language development.&nbsp; Every teacher needs to use instructional routines that allow students to engage in all of these literacy processes.

The postulates of quantum mechanics and the mathematical underpinnings are discussed in a clear, succinct manner.&#34; (American Scientist) &#34;No matter how gently one introduces students to the concept of Dirac?s bras and kets, many are turned off. Shankar attacks the problem head-on in the first chapter, and in a very informal style suggests that there is nothing to be frightened of.&#34; (Physics Bulletin) Reviews of the Second Edition: &#34;This massive text of 700 and odd pages has indeed an excellent get-up, is very verbal and expressive, and has extensively worked out calculational details---all just right for a first course. The style is conversational, more like a corridor talk or lecture notes, though arranged as a text. ? It would be particularly useful to beginning students and those in allied areas like quantum chemistry.&#34; (Mathematical Reviews) R. Shankar has introduced major additions and updated key presentations in this second edition of Principles of Quantum Mechanics. New features of this innovative text include an entirely rewritten mathematical introduction, a discussion of Time-reversal invariance, and extensive coverage of a variety of path integrals and their applications. Additional highlights include: - Clear, accessible treatment of underlying mathematics - A review of Newtonian, Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian mechanics - Student understanding of quantum theory is enhanced by separate treatment of mathematical theorems and physical postulates - Unsurpassed coverage of path integrals and their relevance in contemporary physics The requisite text for advanced undergraduate- and graduate-level students, Principles of Quantum Mechanics, Second Edition is fully referenced and is supported by many exercises and solutions. The book?s self-contained chapters also make it suitable for independent study as well as for courses in applied disciplines.</p><p>`An excellent text....The postulates of quantum mechanics and the mathematical underpinnings are discussed in a clear, succint manner.' - <em>American Scientist,</em> from a review of the First Edition</p><h2>Teach Yourself VISUALLY Windows 10 (Teach Yourself VISUALLY (Tech))</h2><p><b>Learn Windows 10 visually with step-by-step instructions</b> <p><i>Teach Yourself VISUALLY Windows 10</i> is the visual learner's guide to the latest Windows upgrade.

Now, physicist Leonard Susskind has teamed up with data engineer Art Friedman to present the theory and associated mathematics of the strange world of quantum mechanics.<br><br>In this follow-up to the New York Times best-selling <i>The Theoretical Minimum</i>, Susskind and Friedman provide a lively introduction to this famously difficult field, which attempts to understand the behavior of sub-atomic objects through mathematical abstractions. Unlike other popularizations that shy away from quantum mechanics' weirdness, <i>Quantum Mechanics</i> embraces the utter strangeness of quantum logic. The authors offer crystal-clear explanations of the principles of quantum states, uncertainty and time dependence, entanglement, and particle and wave states, among other topics, and each chapter includes exercises to ensure mastery of each area. Like <i>The Theoretical Minimum</i>, this volume runs parallel to Susskind's eponymous Stanford University-hosted continuing education course.<br><br>An approachable yet rigorous introduction to a famously difficult topic, <i>Quantum Mechanics</i> provides a tool kit for amateur scientists to learn physics at their own pace.<br></p><p><b>Leonard Susskind</b> has been the Felix Bloch Professor in Theoretical Physics at Stanford University since 1978.

He lives in Palo Alto, California. <b>Art Friedman</b> is a data consultant who previously spent fifteen years at Hewlett-Packard as a software engineer. A lifelong student of physics, he lives in Mountain View, California.<br>The writing is fresh and immediate, with plenty of detail packaged into the smooth narrative.... [O]n their own terms, I found Susskind and Friedman's explanations crisp and satisfying.... I maintain a clear recollection of the bewilderment with which I struggled through my own university quantum-mechanics courses. For students in a similar position, trying to draw together the fragments of formalism into a clear conceptual whole, Susskind and Friedman's persuasive overview and their insistence on explaining, with sharp mathematical detail, exactly what it is that is strange about quantum mechanics may be just what is needed.&#x201d;<br><b> David Seery, <i>Nature</i></b><br><br> [T]he book will work well as a companion text for university students studying quantum mechanics or the armchair physicists following Susskind's YouTube lectures.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br> This is quantum mechanics for real.

Narrating the novel is a young man with a passion for the truth, who questions the pharaoh's contemporaries after his horrible death--including Akhenaten's closest friends, his most bitter enemies, and finally his enigmatic wife, Nefertiti--in an effort to discover what really happened in those strange, dark days at Akhenaten's court. As our narrator and each of the subjects he interviews contribute their version of Akhenaten, "the truth" becomes increasingly evanescent. Akhenaten encompasses all of the contradictions his subjects see in him: at once cruel and empathic, feminine and barbaric, mad and divinely inspired, his character, as Mahfouz imagines him, is eerily modern, and fascinatingly ethereal. An ambitious and exceptionally lucid and accessible book, Akhenaten is a work only Mahfouz could render so elegantly, so irresistibly.Praise for Naguib Mahfouz:<br> <br>"The greatest writer in one of the most widely understood languages in the world, a storyteller of the first order in any idiom."--<i>Vanity Fair</i><br> <br>"A Dickens of the Cairo caf�s." --<i>Newsweek</i><br> <br>"The incredible variety of Naguib Mahfouz's writings continue to dazzle our eyes."--<i>The Washington Post</i><br><br>"Naguib Mahfouz virtually invented the novel as an Arab form.

It is a prescient fable for our time, one that surprisingly continues to shed light on our modern relationship with China. Indeed, the furious trade in furs, opium, and beche-de-mer&#x2015;a rare sea cucumber delicacy&#x2015;might have catalyzed America&#x2019;s emerging economy, but it also sparked an ecological and human rights catastrophe of such epic proportions that the reverberations can still be felt today.

I had planned to study nuclear physics, but when I discovered in an introductory psychology course that psychology was really a science, I decided that was what I wanted to do. Before changing my major, I talked with several professors and visited their laboratories, and when I saw what physiological psychologists do, I knew that I had found my niche. I stayed on at Illinois and received my Ph.D. Then, after a two-year postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Iowa, I came to the University of Massachusetts, where I&#x2019;ve been ever since.</p> <p> <br>When I arrived at UMass I established a laboratory where I investigated the role of the limbic system in species-typical and learned behaviors, continuing work I had done at the University of Illinois. I received several Biomedical Research Support Grants and a research grant from NICHD. As I became more involved in textbook writing, I began to focus my attention more and more on this activity and on my teaching.</p> <p> <br>I took the opportunity afforded by my first sabbatical leave to write the first edition of Physiology of Behavior. I very much enjoyed the experience, and this endeavor taught me much more about behavioral neuroscience. I was gratified with the positive response of my students and of the colleagues who adopted the book. The pleasure provided by this response and by the enjoyment of keeping up with the literature and writing about it has kept me going for 11 editions. (I have no plans to stop writing.)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I retired from UMass in the fall of 2004 but continue to keep up with developments in the field of behavioral neuroscience and revise my book.

At the end of each chapter, a new self-assessment checklist encourages students to take stock of what they have learned to do. </li><li> <b>New design and art </b>increase the user-friendliness of <b>Chez nous, 4/e</b>.

To a surprising extent, to know the crow is to know ourselves.&#x201d; from the Preface</p><p>From the cave walls at Lascaux to the last painting by Van Gogh, from the works of Shakespeare to those of Mark Twain, there is clear evidence that crows and ravens influence human culture. Yet this influence is not unidirectional, say the authors&nbsp; of this fascinating book: people profoundly influence crow culture, ecology, and evolution as well.</p><p>John Marzluff and Tony Angell examine the often surprising ways that crows and humans interact. The authors contend that those interactions reflect a process of cultural coevolution.&#x201d; They offer a challenging new view of the human-crow dynamic a view that may change our thinking not only about crows but also about ourselves.</p><p>Featuring more than 100 original drawings, the book takes a close look at the influences people have had on the lives of crows throughout history and at the significant ways crows have altered human lives. In the <i>Company of Crows</i> <i>and </i><i>Ravens</i> illuminates the entwined histories of crows and people and concludes with an intriguing discussion of the crow-human relationship and how our attitudes toward crows may affect our cultural trajectory.</p></p><p>Q: How did you come to write this book?<p></p><i>A: Seven years ago we set out to write a natural history of the American crow, but a much different book emerged a natural and cultural history of crows and ravens worldwide. Discovering the joint history of people and crows opened our eyes to the close and continuing relationship evolving between people and elements of the natural world. We hope others can experience our discovery. Crows are elegant without benefit of fancy and colorful plumage; they are animated and physically imposing, the fuel for artistic inspiration.<p></p></i>Q: You&#x2019;ve studied crows and ravens extensively. Does it seem that they in turn study you?<p></p><i>A: (Marzluff) I particularly remember a raven who carefully approached one of myb traps, stopped short of stepping into it, and reached over to pull the grass camouflage off the trap&#x2019;s trigger. He turned to look down the road at me before emphatically throwing the grass into the road and deftly reaching over the trap to grab the bread I used as bait. He didn&#x2019;t have to look at me, but he did like a celebratory football player who just scored!<p></p>A: (Angell) My raven Macaw employed my greeting&#x201d; each morning as a vocal initiation of each day. After a few months of my saying Hello, Macaw,&#x201d; to him as a young bird, he would say Hello, Macaw,&#x201d; sometimes before I spoke, rather like a Good morning&#x201d; greeting. He always used it in this context during his time with me.<p></p></i>Q: What might your readers be most surprised to learn about these birds?<p></p><i>A: Our conclusion that crows have culture, and that it affects and is affected by&nbsp; human culture, makes us realize that we share more than some would like to think with other animals. The tales from people who have witnessed apparent crow murders, funerals, and visitations from dead relatives will certainly shake readers. We hope that by bringing up such controversial crow traits, others will study them and help us all understand the actions of these powerful birds. That crows and their kin possess culture that in some ways parallels our own is a consideration not easily addressed.<p></p></i><b>John M.

(Modern Library College Editions)</h2><p>Recounts the story of the Sutpens, a Southern family, and how their dynasty fell into decadence after the Civil War</p><p>Absalom! Absalom! is William Faulkner's major work--his most important and ambitious contribution to American literature. In the dramatic texture of this story of the founding, flourishing and decay of the plantation of Sutpen's Hundred, and of the family that demonic Stephen Sutpen brought into the world a generation before the Civil War, there rises the lament of the South for its own vanished splendor. From its magnificent and bold inception, when with his wild Negroes the founder of the great plantation appeared out of nowhere to seize his hundred square miles of land and build his mansion, through the destruction of the Civil War and its aftermath, and the drab beginnings of the new South, the narrative is colored by the author's glowing imagery, his command of a powerful and magical prose style. Beneath its brilliant surface and dark undercurrents, the novel sweeps backward and forward through time. The story in all its ramifications becomes crystallized in the mind of a relative of this strange family, young Quentin Compson, a Harvard student. At the terrifying and abrupt end of the tale there remain in the crumbling shell of the old house only the dying son of its builder, an ancient Negro woman who had been his slave, and the idiot mulatto youth who was to be the only direct descendant of the Sutpen blood. <br>This edition is set from the first American edition of 1936 and commemorates the seventy-fifth anniversary of Random House.<p>William Cuthbert Faulkner was born in 1897 and raised in Oxford, Mississippi, where he spent most of his life. One of the towering figures of American literature, he is the author of <i>The Sound and the Fury</i>, <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i>, and <i>As I Lay Dying</i>, among many other&nbsp; remarkable books. Faulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1950 and France&#x2019;s Legion of Honor in 1951.

Robert Jordan, a young American volunteer, has been sent to handle the dynamiting. There, in the mountains, he finds the dangers and the intense comradeship of war. And there he discovers Maria, a young woman who has escaped from Franco&#39;s rebels...</p><p><i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i> begins and ends in a pine-scented forest, somewhere in Spain. The year is 1937 and the Spanish Civil War is in full swing. Robert Jordan, a demolitions expert attached to the International Brigades, lies "flat on the brown, pine-needled floor of the forest, his chin on his folded arms, and high overhead the wind blew in the tops of the pine trees." The sylvan setting, however, is at sharp odds with the reason Jordan is there: he has come to blow up a bridge on behalf of the antifascist guerrilla forces. He hopes he'll be able to rely on their local leader, Pablo, to help carry out the mission, but upon meeting him, Jordan has his doubts: "I don't like that sadness, he thought. That sadness is bad. That's the sadness they get before they quit or before they betray. That is the sadness that comes before the sell-out." For Pablo, it seems, has had enough of the war. He has amassed for himself a small herd of horses and wants only to stay quietly in the hills and attract as little attention as possible. Jordan's arrival--and his mission--have seriously alarmed him. <blockquote> "I am tired of being hunted. Here we are all right. Now if you blow a bridge here, we will be hunted. If they know we are here and hunt for us with planes, they will find us. If they send Moors to hunt us out, they will find us and we must go. I am tired of all this. You hear?" He turned to Robert Jordan. "What right have you, a foreigner, to come to me and tell me what I must do?" </blockquote> In one short chapter Hemingway lays out the blueprint for what is to come: Jordan's sense of duty versus Pablo's dangerous self-interest and weariness with the war. Complicating matters even more are two members of the guerrilla leader's small band: his "woman" Pilar, and Maria, a young woman whom Pablo rescued from a Republican prison train. Unlike her man, Pilar is still fiercely devoted to the cause and as Pablo's loyalty wanes, she becomes the moral center of the group. Soon Jordan finds himself caught between the two, even as his own resolve is tested by his growing feelings for Maria. <p> <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i> combines two of the author's recurring obsessions: war and personal honor. The pivotal battle scene involving El Sordo's last stand is a showcase for Hemingway's narrative powers, but the quieter, ongoing conflict within Robert Jordan as he struggles to fulfill his mission perhaps at the cost of his own life is a testament to his creator's psychological acuity. By turns brutal and compassionate, it is arguably Hemingway's most mature work and one of the best war novels of the 20th century. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>11 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Health Information Management: Concepts, Principles, and Practice</h2><p>Health Information Management: Concepts, Principles and Practice, Fifth Edition, is a textbook for students and healthcare professionals alike.

Z. Guest, Kennedys, Rockefellers, and more. Lavishly illustrated with photographs and drawings of the guests, this portrait of revelry at the height of the swirling, swinging sixties is a must for anyone interested in American popular culture and the lifestyles of the rich, famous, and talented.</p><p><p>Flush with the massive bestsellerdom of In Cold Blood, which earned him millions, Capote decided to throw an extraordinary masked ball&#x2014;partly in honor of his friend the Washington Post president Katharine Graham and partly to celebrate his own success at the end of the grueling process of writing the book&#x2014;at New York's legendary Plaza Hotel. The invitees were to wear just two colors: black and white. For several months, the most sought-after piece of paper in New York and jet-setting society was the tasteful white card bearing the words "Mr. Truman Capote requests the pleasure of your company at a Black and White Dance." Everyone who was anyone wanted the invitation. Capote boasted that he invited five hundred friends but made fifteen thousand enemies&#x2014;those who weren't invited. </p><p>The glittering roster of guests included newlyweds Frank Sinatra and Mia Farrow, the young actress Candice Bergen, literary lions Norman Mailer and William F. Buckley, and various international crowned heads, Kennedys, Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, and Whitneys. Truman made sure to invite his carefully cultivated society friends, the flock of wealthy, elegant, ultra-fashionable society matrons whom Capote called his "swans" and who included Babe Paley, C. Z. Guest, Slim Keith, Gloria Guinness, and Marella Agnelli. Wanting to keep the party mix interesting and unpredictable, Capote also invited people from the town where the murders from In Cold Blood occurred, publishing types, and even the doorman from the U.N. Plaza, his apartment building. </p><p>In this vivid and delightful narrative, Deborah Davis chronicles all the social whirl of the preparation and the anticipation leading up to the party, including delicious facts such as where the guests bought their gowns and diamonds, how they chose their masks designed by the likes of Adolfo and Halston, and where they dined before the party. Then, in fascinating detail, Davis captures the drama and excitement of the ball itself. Unlike many such ballyhooed events, this evening truly lived up to its fanfare: Alice Roosevelt Longworth told the New York Times that the party was "the most exquisite of spectator sports." </p><p>Lavishly illustrated with photographs and drawings of the guests and their gorgeous and extravagant costumes, masks, and jewels and including the guest list, the recipe for the Plaza chicken hash served at the ball, and other memorabilia, this portrait of revelry at the height of the swirling, swinging, turbulent sixties will be the book of the season for anyone interested in American popular culture and the lifestyles and legacies of the rich, famous, and talented.</p>"Parties are the nightly ritual of sophisticated society. I find it fascinating that Truman Capote's famous Black and White Ball at the Plaza Hotel in New York in 1966 has become one of those legendary parties that exemplifies the ritual as a part of social and literary history. How beautifully Bedorah Davis has recounted the creation and execution of Truman's ball in minute and dishy detail.

Fortunately, there is still time to reverse this alarming trend, and gardeners have the power to make a significant contribution toward sustaining biodiversity. <br> As this revelatory book eloquently explains, there is an unbreakable link between native plant species and native wildlife. Indeed, most native insects cannot, or will not, eat alien plants. When native plant species disappear or are replaced by alien exotics, the insects disappear, thus impoverishing the food source of birds and other animals. In many parts of the world, habitat destruction has been so extensive that local wildlife populations are in crisis and may well be headed toward extinction. <br> By favoring native plants, gardeners can provide a welcoming environment for wildlife of all kinds. This doesn't necessarily entail a drastic overhaul of existing gardens. The process can be gradual and can reflect both the gardner's preferences and local sensitivities. To help concerned gardeners, this clearly reasoned account includes helpful lists of native plants for different regional habitats. <br> Healthy local ecosystems are not only beautiful and fascinating; they are also essential to human well-being. By heeding Douglas Tallamy's affecting arguments and acting upon his practical recommendations, gardeners everywhere can make a difference.</p><h2>Completing Your Qualitative Dissertation: A Roadmap From Beginning to End</h2><p><strong>Completing Your Qualitative Dissertation </strong>fills an important gap in qualitative research literature by specifically addressing the fast-growing practice of qualitative master&#x2032;s studies and doctoral dissertations in colleges and universities throughout the world.

Marieb</b>, taking the student&#x2019;s perspective into account has always been an integral part of her teaching style. Dr. Marieb began her teaching career at Springfield College, where she taught anatomy and physiology to physical education majors. She then joined the faculty of the Biological Science Division of Holyoke Community College in 1969 after receiving her Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. While teaching at Holyoke Community College, where many of her students were pursuing nursing degrees, she developed a desire to better understand the relationship between the scientific study of the human body and the clinical aspects of the nursing practice. To that end, while continuing to teach full time, Dr. Marieb pursued her nursing education, which culminated in a Master of Science degree with a clinical specialization in gerontology from the University of Massachusetts. It is this experience that has informed the development of the unique perspective and accessibility for which her publications are known.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Dr. Marieb has partnered with Benjamin Cummings for over 30 years. Her first work was Human Anatomy &amp; Physiology Laboratory Manual (Cat Version), which came out in 1981. In the years since, several other lab manual versions and study guides, as well as the softcover Essentials of Human Anatomy &amp; Physiology textbook, have hit the campus bookstores. This textbook, now in its 10th edition, made its appearance in 1989 and is the latest expression of her commitment to the needs of students studying human anatomy and physiology.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Dr. Marieb has given generously to colleges both near and far to provide opportunities for students to further their education.

Now comes a brilliant portrait of the American Revolution, one that is compelling in its prose, fascinating in its details, and provocative in its fresh interpretations.<br><br>In <em>A Leap in the Dark</em>, John Ferling offers a magisterial new history that surges from the first rumblings of colonial protest to the volcanic election of 1800. Ferling's swift-moving narrative teems with fascinating details. We see Benjamin Franklin trying to decide if his loyalty was to Great Britain or to America, and we meet George Washington when he was a shrewd planter-businessman who discovered personal economic advantages to American independence. We encounter those who supported the war against Great Britain in 1776, but opposed independence because it was a "leap in the dark." Following the war, we hear talk in the North of secession from the United States. The author offers a gripping account of the most dramatic events of our history, showing just how closely fought were the struggle for independence, the adoption of the Constitution, and the later battle between Federalists and Democratic-Republicans. Yet, without slowing the flow of events, he has also produced a landmark study of leadership and ideas. Here is all the erratic brilliance of Hamilton and Jefferson battling to shape the new nation, and here too is the passion and political shrewdness of revolutionaries, such as Samuel Adams and Patrick Henry, and their Loyalist counterparts, Joseph Galloway and Thomas Hutchinson. Here as well are activists who are not so well known today, men like Abraham Yates, who battled for democratic change, and Theodore Sedgwick, who fought to preserve the political and social system of the colonial past. Ferling shows that throughout this period the epic political battles often resembled today's politics and the politicians--the founders--played a political hardball attendant with enmities, selfish motivations, and bitterness. The political stakes, this book demonstrates, were extraordinary: first to secure independence, then to determine the meaning of the American Revolution. <br><br>John Ferling has shown himself to be an insightful historian of our Revolution, and an unusually skillful writer. <em>A Leap in the Dark</em> is his masterpiece, work that provokes, enlightens, and entertains in full measure.<br></p><p><br><strong>John Ferling</strong> is a Professor of History at the State University of West Georgia. A familiar face in history documentaries on television, he has written numerous books, including <em>John Adams: A Life, The First of Men: A Life of George Washington</em>, and <em>Setting the World Ablaze: Washington, Adams, and</em> <em>Jefferson in the American Revolution</em>.<br><br>"This book moves like a bottle rocket."--<em>Kansas City Star</em><p></p><br>"Every generation of Americans deserves a first-class history of the revolutionary era, and John Ferling has supplied it for this one. Those 2 million readers of David McCullough's <em>John Adams</em>, captivated by Adams's ardent patriotism and fiery opinions, will especially benefit from returning to the subject under the firm direction of a historian with a command of the scholarship that is matched by his gifts as a writer."--Joyce Appleby, <em>Washington Post Book World</em><p></p><br>"This deft account of the American struggle for independence dispels the aura of inevitability that usually surrounds such histories by beginning its narrative not on the verge of the Revolution but twenty years earlier....Ferling vividly evokes the political turmoil of the post-Revolutionary years. Even as he takes the Founders off their pedestals, their accomplishments only gain in stature."--<em>The New Yorker</em><p></p><br>"Solid history that will refresh anyone's memory of the essential stories and figures in America's founding. And it will enlighten anyone about the origin of some current civic problems....His book provides not just political and intellectual history, but emotional history as well."--<em>Christian</em> <em>Science Monitor</em><p></p><br>"The author's prose is smooth, but spellbinding. He brings to life the flinty, cross-grained Alexander Hamilton, the acute and enduring thoughts of John Adams, and some minor characters not found in most history books....Ferling has written several books on the Revolutionary period, but <em>A Leap in</em> <em>the Dark</em> may well be his masterpiece."--<em>Dallas Morning News</em><p></p><br>"Many Americans today see the period from 1754 to 1801 in American history as a rational progression from British colony to the independent United States. Nothing could be further from the truth, as shown by Ferling in this account of the Founding Fathers' struggles to do what had not been done before: create a nation. Throughout, he debunks popularly held notions....Ferling's intriguing narrative is filled with stories of Americans both famous and obsure."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"In <em>A Leap in the Dark</em>, John Ferling conveys the personal and contingent character of public affairs by skillfully interweaving capsule biographies of leaders into his analysis of events. His book, which stretches from the French and Indian War through the inauguration of President Thomas Jefferson, supplies a learned and readable narrative of American politics during a crucial era in the nation's history."--Richard Brown, University of Connecticut<p></p><br>"Questions about the establishment of the American Union are the focal point of this traditionally fashioned political history of Revolutionary America that moves gracefully from the period of the Seven Years' War through the presidential election of 1800. [Ferling] capably describesthe emergence of the newfound republican political order. Present[s] the various political achievements of the American Revolution in a highly engaging fashion, making for a study that deserves a large reading audience."--James Kirby Martin, <em>The Historian</em>, University of Houston<p></p><br></p><h2>The Green State: Rethinking Democracy and Sovereignty (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p>What would constitute a definitively "green" state? In this important new book, Robyn Eckersley explores what it might take to create a green democratic state as an alternative to the classical liberal democratic state, the indiscriminate growth-dependent welfare state, and the neoliberal market-focused state&#x2015;seeking, she writes, "to navigate between undisciplined political imagination and pessimistic resignation to the status quo." In recent years, most environmental scholars and environmentalists have characterized the sovereign state as ineffectual and have criticized nations for perpetuating ecological destruction. Going consciously against the grain of much current thinking, this book argues that the state is still the preeminent political institution for addressing environmental problems. States remain the gatekeepers of the global order, and greening the state is a necessary step, Eckersley argues, toward greening domestic and international policy and law.</p><p><i>The Green State</i> seeks to connect the moral and practical concerns of the environmental movement with contemporary theories about the state, democracy, and justice. Eckersley's proposed "critical political ecology" expands the boundaries of the moral community to include the natural environment in which the human community is embedded. This is the first book to make the vision of a "good" green state explicit, to explore the obstacles to its achievement, and to suggest practical constitutional and multilateral arrangements that could help transform the liberal democratic state into a postliberal green democratic state. Rethinking the state in light of the principles of ecological democracy ultimately casts it in a new role: that of an ecological steward and facilitator of transboundary democracy rather than a selfish actor jealously protecting its territory.</p></p><p>"A magnificent achievement which will be a key point of reference for years to come." <br>--Andrew Dobson, Department of Government and Politics, Open University <p>"Eckersley's book will be a significant contribution for those in several subfields of politics -- theory, comparative, international -- for those concerned about green politics, and for those who work on theories of the state. It is especially significant that she offers critical assessments of both the realist perspective on the environmental crisis and the limits of the greening of the liberal democractic state." <br>--Ronnie Lipschutz, Department of Politics, University of California, Santa Cruz </p><p> "Although the question of the state is unavoidable for green political theory, a systematic and comprehensive treatment of the state in a green context has until now been lacking. That gap is admirably filled by Robyn Eckersley's *The Green State*, which works through contending theories of the state, both in domestic and international contexts, to fashion a powerful and original argument. This is a major and important contribution." <br>--Douglas Torgerson, Department of Political Studies, Trent University </p><p> "In this compelling book Robyn Eckersley challenges much green pessimism about the state's capacity to contribute to ecological reform. She draws on an extensive literature in critical theory, political philosophy, international relations and the global environment to develop 'a cautiously optimistic assessment' of the prospects for 'ecologically responsible statehood.' *The Green State* is certain to alter the terms of the debate about the state and world politics. It will be the first port of call for analysts of the state and the global environment for years to come, but its influence will almost certainly extend beyond these confines to many other areas of contemporary social and political inquiry." <br>--Andrew Linklater, Woodrow Wilson Professor, University of Wales, Aberystwyth</p>Robyn Eckersley is Reader/Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Melbourne.

Pierre Bourdieu&#x2019;s<em> Distinction</em> brilliantly illuminates the social pretentions of the middle classes in the modern world, focusing on the tastes and preferences of the French bourgeoisie. First published in 1979, the book is at once a vast ethnography of contemporary France and a dissection of the bourgeois mind. </p> <p>In the course of everyday life we constantly choose between what we find aesthetically pleasing, and what we consider tacky, merely trendy, or ugly. Taste is not pure. Bourdieu demonstrates that our different aesthetic choices are all distinctions - that is, choices made in opposition to those made by other classes. This fascinating work argues that the social world functions simultaneously as a system of power relations and as a symbolic system in which minute distinctions of taste become the basis for social judgement.</p></p><p>This is at once a vast ethnography of contemporary France and a dissection of the bourgeois mind. The subject is the study of culture, and the objective is most ambitious: to provide an answer to the problems raised by Kant&#39;s Critique Of Judgment by showing why no judgment of taste is innocent.<p>Pierre Bourdieu (1930&#x2013;2002) was one of France&#x2019;s leading sociologists.

Originally written in the sixteenth century, it is the story of the adventures of the rogue-trickster Monkey and his encounters with a bizarre cast of characters as he travels to India with the Buddhist pilgrim Tripitaka in search of sacred scriptures. Much more than a picaresque adventure novel, <i>Monkey</i> is a profound allegory of the struggle that must occur before spiritual transformation is possible.

It pioneered the connections between phenomenology and science and between Buddhist practices and science&#x2015;claims that have since become highly influential. Through this cross-fertilization of disparate fields of study, <i>The Embodied Mind</i> introduced a new form of cognitive science called &#x201c;enaction,&#x201d; in which both the environment and first person experience are aspects of embodiment. However, enactive embodiment is not the grasping of an independent, outside world by a brain, a mind, or a self; rather it is the bringing forth of an interdependent world in and through embodied action. Although enacted cognition lacks an absolute foundation, the book shows how that does not lead to either experiential or philosophical nihilism. Above all, the book's arguments were powered by the conviction that the sciences of mind must encompass lived human experience and the possibilities for transformation inherent in human experience. </p><p>This revised edition includes substantive introductions by Evan Thompson and Eleanor Rosch that clarify central arguments of the work and discuss and evaluate subsequent research that has expanded on the themes of the book, including the renewed theoretical and practical interest in Buddhism and mindfulness.

They are, perhaps, the most frequently produced works on the planet.Since we will never hear tapes of Keats or Shakespeare reading, and several recordings by actors exist (e.g., John Keats: Selected Poems, Blackstone Audio, 1993; Sonnets by William Shakespeare, Recorded Bks., 1990), we must judge these tapes by the actors' performances. In John Keats: Poems, Douglas Dodge modulates his voice beautifully to capture the slightly varied emotions of many poems. This well-edited recording contains Keats's most famous works: "La Belle Dame Sans Merci," "The Eve of St. Agnes," "Ode to a Nightingale," "On a Grecian Urn," along with many lesser-known short poems such as "To Mrs. Reynolds' Cat" that exhibit the poet's more fanciful side. Reading all of Shakespeare's sonnets written between 1593 and 1601, actor Simon Callow conveys the dramatic potential not often recognizable in other recordings. With the exception of a few sonnets addressing the muse, anyone unfamiliar with Shakespeare's works could easily believe these were selected monologs from various plays. Pausing briefly between poems, Callow's tone shifts enough to create new characterizations for every sonnet. Both tapes are recommended for smaller collections and essential for larger ones.<br><i>Rochelle Ratner, formerly Poetry Editor, "Soho Weekly News," New York</i><br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Rise to Globalism</h2><p>This is a classic survey of US foreign policy from 1938 to President Clinton&#39;s second term, now fully revised.</p><p>Stephen Ambrose and Douglas Brinkley are both Professors of History at the University of New Orleans.<p><b>Introduction</b></p><p><b>IN 1939, ON THE EVE OF WORLD WAR II, THE UNITED STATES HAD AN</b> army of 185,000 men with an annual budget of less than $500 million. America had no entangling alliances and no American troops were stationed in any foreign country. The dominant political mood was isolationism. America&#x2019;s physical security, the <i>sine qua non</i> of foreign policy, seemed assured, not because of American alliances or military strength but because of the distance between America and any potential enemy.</p><p>A half century later the United States had a huge standing Army, Air Force, and Navy. The budget of the Department of Defense was over $300 billion. The United States had military alliances with fifty nations, over a million soldiers, airmen, and sailors stationed in more than 100 countries, and an offensive capability sufficient to destroy the world many times over. It had used military force to intervene in Indochina, Lebanon, the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Central America, and the Persian Gulf, supported an invasion of Cuba, distributed enormous quantities of arms to friendly governments around the world, and fought costly wars in Korea and Vietnam. But despite all the money spent on armaments and no matter how far outward America extended her power, America&#x2019;s national security was constantly in jeopardy.</p><p>By 1993, however, the Soviet Union was gone, there were no military threats to the United States, and the American armed forces were shrinking. America&#x2019;s overseas concerns were no longer the armies and missiles of the communist superpower, but access to raw materials and markets and concern over small nations causing major upheavals, plus the trade policies of its World War II enemies, Germany and Japan. America had won the Cold War and was once again, as in 1939, turning away from the world.</p><p>Shifts in attitudes accompanied these bewildering changes in policy. Before World War II most Americans believed in a natural harmony of interests between nations, assumed that there was a common commitment to peace, and argued that no nation or people could profit from a war. These beliefs implied that peace was the normal condition between states and that war, if it came, was an aberration resulting from the irrational acts of evil or psychotic men. It was odd that a nation that had come into existence through a victorious war, gained large portions of its territory through war, established its industrial revolution and national unity through a bloody civil war, and won a colonial empire through war could believe that war profited no one. Yet most Americans in the 1930s did so believe.</p><p>During and after World War II, Americans changed their attitudes. They did not come to relish war, but they did learn to accept it. They also became aware of their own vulnerability, which supported the post-Pearl Harbor belief that threats had to be met early and overseas. After World War I, the United States had adopted a policy of unilateral disarmament and neutrality as a way to avoid another war. After World War II, the nation adopted a policy of massive rearmament and collective security as a way to avoid another war. That meant stationing troops and missiles overseas.</p><p>Technological change, especially in military weapons, gave added impetus to the new expansionism. For the first time in its history the United States could be threatened from abroad. High-speed ships, long-range bombers, jet aircraft, atomic weapons, and eventually intercontinential missiles all combined to endanger the physical security of the United States.</p><p>Simultaneously, America became vulnerable to foreign economic threats. An increasingly complex economy, coupled with the tremendous economic boom of the postwar years maintained by cheap energy, made America increasingly dependent on foreign sources.</p><p>And so, the irony. America had far more military power in the early 1990s than she had had in the late thirties, but she was less secure. America was far richer in the nineties than she had been during the Depression, but also more vulnerable to economic blackmail.</p><p>It was an unexpected outcome. At the conclusion of World War II, America was on a high. In all the world only the United States had a healthy economy, an intact physical plant capable of mass production of goods, and excess capital. American troops occupied Japan, the only important industrial power in the Pacific, while American influence was dominant in France, Britain, and West Germany, the industrial heart of Europe. The Pacific and the Mediterranean had become American lakes. Above all, the United States had a monopoly on the atomic bomb.</p><p>Yet there was no peace. The Cold War came about because the United States and the U.S.S.R. were deeply suspicious of each other, and with good reason. Economic rivalry and ideological differences helped fuel the rivalry, but another important factor was the pace of scientific and technological change in the postwar period. Nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them became the pivot around which much of the Cold War revolved. The fear that its opponents would move ahead on this or that weapons system drove each nation to make an all-out effort in the arms race. In the United States the resulting growth of the armed services and their suppliers&#x2014;the military-industrial complex&#x2014;gave generals, admirals, and industrialists new sources of power, leading to a situation in which Americans tended to find military solutions to political problems. Not until the late sixties did large numbers of Americans learn the costly lesson that the power to destroy is not the power to control.</p><p>The United States of the Cold War period, like ancient Rome, was concerned with all political problems in the world. The loss of even one country to Communism, therefore, while not in itself a threat to American physical security, carried implications that officials in Washington found highly disturbing. In the early sixties, few important officials argued that South Vietnam was essential to the defense of the United States, but the attitude that &#x201c;we have to prove that wars of national liberation don&#x2019;t work&#x201d; (a curious attitude for the children of the American Revolution to hold) did carry the day.</p><p>America&#x2019;s rise to globalism was by no means mindless, nor was it exclusively a reaction to the Communist challenge or a response to economic needs. A frequently heard expression during World War II was that &#x201c;America has come of age.&#x201d; Americans had a sense of power, of bigness, of destiny. They had saved the world from Hitler; now they would save the world from Stalin. In the process, American influence and control would expand. During World War II, Henry Luce of <i>Life</i> magazine spoke for most political leaders as well as American businessmen, soldiers, and the public generally when he said that the twentieth century would be &#x201c;the American century.&#x201d; Politicians looked for areas in which American influence could dominate. Businessmen looked for profitable markets and new sources of cheap raw materials; the military looked for overseas bases. All found what they wanted as America inaugurated a program of expansion that had no inherent limits.</p><p>Americans launched a crusade for freedom that would be complete only when freedom reigned everywhere. Conservatives like Senator Robert Taft doubted that such a goal was obtainable, and old New Dealers like Henry Wallace argued that it could only be achieved at the cost of domestic reform. But most politicians and nearly all businessmen and soldiers signed on as crusaders.</p><p>While America&#x2019;s businessmen, soldiers, and politicians moved into South and Central America, Europe, and Southeast Asia, her leaders rarely paused to wonder if there were limits to American power. The disorderly expansion and the astronomical growth of areas defined as constituting a vital American interest seemed to Washington, Wall Street, and the Pentagon to be entirely normal and natural. Almost no important public figure argued that the nation was overextended, just as no one could suggest any attitude toward Communism other than unrelieved hostility.</p><p>But ultimately, military reality put limits on American expansion. At no time after 1945 was the United States capable of destroying Russia or her allies without taking on totally unacceptable risks herself; at no time was the United States able to establish an imperial dominion. The crusade against Communism, therefore, took the form of containment rather than attack. As a policy, containment, with its implication of an acceptance of a permanently divided world, led to widely felt frustration. These frustrations were deepened by self-imposed constraint on the use of force in Korea, Vietnam, and elsewhere.</p><p>The failure of containment in Indochina led to another basic shift in attitude toward America&#x2019;s role in the world. It was not a return to isolationism, 1939 style&#x2014;the pendulum did not swing that far. It was a general realization that, given the twin restraints of fears of provoking a Russian nuclear strike and America&#x2019;s reluctance to use her full military power, there was relatively little the United States could accomplish by force of arms. President Reagan showed an awareness of these limits in Poland, Afghanistan, and even Central America, and in withdrawing from Lebanon.</p><p>Following the involvement in Vietnam there was also a shift in the focus of American foreign policy, especially after 1973, when the Arab oil boycott made Americans suddenly aware that the Middle East was so important to them. Nixon&#x2019;s 1972 trip to China, the emergence of black Africa, and the discovery of abundant raw materials in both Africa and South America helped turn American eyes from the northern to the southern half of the globe. This shift emphasized the fundamentally changed nature of the American economy, from self-sufficiency to increasing dependency on others for basic supplies. America in the 1990s was richer and more powerful&#x2014;and more vulnerable&#x2014;than at any other time in her history.</p><p>But this cozy global arrangement didn&#x2019;t last long. On September 11, 2001, the United States was attacked by Islamic fundamentalist terrorists. The World Trade Center towers in New York City collapsed and the Pentagon was severely damaged by terrorists using commercial airliners as suicide bombs. Although U.S. intelligence services had warned of a Pearl Harbor-like sneak attack throughout the first months of 2001, President George W. Bush claimed innocence. &#x201c;Had I known there was going to be an attack on America,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I would have moved mountains to stop the attack.&#x201d; As historians we have the luxury of hindsight; our policymakers never do.</p><p>I returned and saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise nor riches to men of understanding, but time and chance happeneth to them all.</p><p>bers of American troops to China.</p></p><h2>Novels, Tales, Journeys: The Complete Prose of Alexander Pushkin (Vintage Classics)</h2><p>Universally acknowledged as Russia&#x2019;s greatest poet, Pushkin wrote with the rich, prolific creative powers of a Mozart or a Shakespeare. His prose spans a remarkable range, from satires to epistolary tales, from light comedies to romantic adventures in the manner of Sir Walter Scott, from travel narratives to historical fiction. The haunting dream world of &#x201c;The Queen of Spades&#x201d; draws on his own experiences with high-stakes society gambling. The five short stories of <i>The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovich Belkin</i> are deceptively light as they reveal astonishing human depths, and his short novel, <i>The Captain&#x2019;s Daughter</i>, a love story set during the Cossack rebellion against Catherine the Great, has been called the most perfect book in Russian literature. <br> &nbsp;<br> By turns daringly dramatic and sparklingly comic, written in the exquisite cadences of a master, <i>Novels, Tales, Journeys</i> captures the essence of nineteenth-century Russia&#x2014;and gives us, in one comprehensive volume, the work with which Pushkin laid the foundations of his country&#x2019;s great prose tradition.</p><p>Alexander Pushkin (1799&#x2013;1837) was a poet, playwright, and novelist who achieved literary prominence before he was twenty. His radical politics led to government censorship and periods of banishment from the capital, but he eventually married a popular society beauty and be�came a regular part of court life. Notoriously touchy about his honor, he died at age thirty-seven in a duel with his wife&#x2019;s alleged lover.<br><br> Together, Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky have translated works by Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov, Gogol, Bulgakov, Leskov, and Pasternak. They were twice awarded the PEN/Book-of-the-Month Club Translation Prize (for Dostoevsky&#x2019;s <i>The Brothers Karamazov </i>and Tolstoy&#x2019;s <i>Anna Karenina</i>). They are married and live in France.<p><b>Introduction </b><br> Alexander Pushkin was mortally wounded in a duel on the afternoon of January 27, 1837, at Chernaya Rechka, just outside Petersburg. &#x201c;It is thus that the figure of Pushkin remains in our memory&#x2014;with a pistol,&#x201d; Andrei Sinyavsky wrote in <i>Strolls with Pushkin.*</i> &#x201c;Little Pushkin with a big pistol. A civilian, but louder than a soldier. A general. An ace. Push�kin! Crude, but just. The first poet with his own biography&#x2014;how else would you have him up and die, this first poet, who inscribed himself with blood and powder in the history of art?&#x201d;<br><br> Pushkin was just thirty-seven when he died, but he had already been acknowledged as Russia&#x2019;s greatest poet, a title that has since been defined and redefined but never disputed. In the decade before his death, however, he had also become the true originator of Russian prose. Sinyavsky is right to say that Pushkin lives in Russian memory as more than a writer, more than a poet&#x2014;as &#x201c;Pushkin!&#x201d; In a speech delivered at a commemoration in revolutionary Petrograd in Febru�ary 1921, the poet Alexander Blok said: &#x201c;From early childhood our memory keeps the cheerful name: Pushkin. This name, this sound fills many days of our life. The grim names of emperors, generals, inven�tors of the tools of murder, the tormented and the tormentors of life. And beside them&#x2014;this light name: Pushkin.&#x201d; Yet his personal presence is in marked contrast with the essential impersonality of Pushkin&#x2019;s art. It is not that he celebrated himself and sang&nbsp;himself: he never did. In a letter to his friend Nikolai Raevsky, written in July 1825, Pushkin criti�cized Byron (whom he generally admired) for the constant intrusion of his personality: &#x201c;Byron . . . has parceled out among his characters such-and-such a trait of his own character; his pride to one, his hate to another, his melancholy to a third, etc.&#x201d;* And he contrasts Byron&#x2019;s practice with the multifarious receptivity he had come to admire in Shakespeare&#x2014;his &#x201c;negative capability,&#x201d; as Keats called it. Sinyavsky intensifies Keats&#x2019;s paradox: &#x201c;Emptiness is Pushkin&#x2019;s content. Without it he would not be full, he would not <i>be, </i>just as there is no fire without air, no breathing in without breathing out.&#x201d; Impersonality, openness, and lightness are the essential qualities of his prose.</p><br>Our collection includes Pushkin&#x2019;s few finished and published works of fiction&#x2014;<i>The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovich Belkin, The Queen of Spades, Kirdjali, The Captain&#x2019;s Daughter</i>&#x2014;each different and all mas�terpieces. It also includes his experiments in various forms, borrowing from and parodying well-known European models, consciously trying out the possibilities of Russian prose. The closest he came to a self-portrait is perhaps the character of Charsky in the fragmentary <i>Egyp�tian Nights; </i>otherwise he appears in person only in the nonfictional <i>Journey to Arzrum, </i>where, as D. S. Mirsky wrote, &#x201c;he reached the limits of noble and bare terseness.&#x201d;<br>Pushkin&#x2019;s family on his father&#x2019;s side belonged to the old military-feudal aristocracy, the Russian boyars, dating back some six centuries to the founding of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. He proudly refers to their &#x201c;six-hundred-year standing&#x201d; more than once in his letters. He was also&nbsp;proud of the rebelliousness of some of his ancestors, o&#x2020;ne of whom was executed by Peter the Great for opposing his political reforms, another of whom (his grandfather) was imprisoned for pro�testing against the &#x201c;usurpation&#x201d; of the throne by the Prussian-born Catherine the Great. The new gentry that arose in the eighteenth cen�tury as a result of Peter&#x2019;s reforms more or less eclipsed the old boyars, and Pushkin&#x2019;s father was left with relatively modest means.<br>On his mother&#x2019;s side, Pushkin&#x2019;s ancestors bore the name of Ganni�bal, from his great-grandfather Ibrahim Gannibal. It was long thought (by Pushkin among others) that Ibrahim was the son of a minor Ethio�pian prince, though recently it has been argued that he came from the sultanate of Logone-Birni in Cameroon. In any case at around the age of five he was sent as a hostage or slave to the court of the Ottoman sultan in Istanbul, and a year later was either ransomed or stolen by Sava Vladislavich-Raguzinsky, advisor to the Russian ambassador, and brought to Petersburg, where he was presented to Peter the Great. Peter was very taken with the boy, stood as godfather at his baptism, gave him the patronymic Petrovich from his own name, and had him educated in the best European fashion. Ibrahim rose to the rank of general, was granted nobility, and had a long military and political career in the reigns of Peter and his daughter Elizabeth. While serving in the French army in his youth he adopted the surname Gannibal, or Hannibal, after the great Carthaginian general.<br><br>Pushkin prized his African ancestry, and his African ancestor, highly, and when he decided, in 1827, to try his hand at a historical novel along the lines of Walter Scott&#x2019;s immensely popular <i>Waverley </i>(published in 1814), he chose the life of Ibrahim as his subject. The result was <i>The&nbsp;Moor of Peter the Great. </i>In an article published three years later, he observed: &#x201c;In our time, by the term novel we mean an histori�cal epoch developed in a fictional narrative.&#x201d;* And indeed, while the two protagonists, Ibrahim and Peter the Great, are fully historical, his portrayal of their interactions is almost entirely invented. We first meet Ibrahim during his military service in the decadent Paris of Philippe d&#x2019;Orl�ans&#x2019;s regency (1715&#x2013;1723), and hear mainly about the complica�tions of his love life, both in France and on his return to Russia. Peter, meanwhile, is busy building his new capital in the north, &#x201c;a vast fac�tory,&#x201d; as it appears to Ibrahim, and though the emperor is referred to at one point as &#x201c;the hero of Poltava, the powerful and terrible reformer of Russia,&#x201d; we see him mainly as the &#x201c;gentle and hospitable host&#x201d; of his godson. More historical and personal complexity is suggested in later chapters, in Peter&#x2019;s relations with the old boyar aristocrats and with the entrance of Ibrahim&#x2019;s rival Valerian, but Pushkin abandoned the novel just at that point and never went back to the <i>Waverley </i>manner.<br>That was in 1828. A year or two later, one of Pushkin&#x2019;s literary enemies, Faddei Bulgarin (Pushkin liked to call him &#x201c;Figlyarin,&#x201d; from <i>figlyar, </i>&#x201c;buffoon&#x201d;), wrote a scurrilous article about a certain unnamed poet whose grandfather was not a Negro prince, as he boasted, but had been bought by a sea captain for a bottle of rum. Pushkin replied in a <i>post scriptum </i>to his poem &#x201c;My Genealogy&#x201d;: &#x201c;That skipper was the glorious skipper / Who started our land moving, / Who forcefully took the helm of our native ship / And set it on a majestic course.&#x201d; Pushkin&#x2019;s awareness of himself as a descendant both of old boyar stock and of the reformer&#x2019;s black godson nourished his meditations on state power in all its contradictions. In the same year that he&nbsp;abandoned his first novel, he wrote the long poem <i>Poltava, </i>about Peter&#x2019;s decisive victory in 1709 over the Swedish forces of Charles XII, which led to the emergence of Russia as the predominant nation of northern Europe. The &#x201c;terrible reformer,&#x201d; grown more ambiguous and demonic in the grim figure of his statue, is also the subject of Pushkin&#x2019;s last long poem, <i>The Bronze Horseman, </i>written in 1833. D. S. Mirsky has called it &#x201c;the greatest work ever penned in Russian verse.&#x201d;<br><br>Pushkin&#x2019;s own confrontation with imperial power had begun many years earlier. After the defeat of Napoleon, Russian troops occupied Paris and camped along the Champs-�lys�es. The victorious coalition restored the French monarchy, but the young Russian officers picked up French revolutionary thinking in the process and came home with new notions of political liberty. French culture had been the dominant influence in Russia since the time of Catherine the Great, who reigned from 1762 until her death in 1796. The aristocracy spoke French, which was Pushkin&#x2019;s first language. In 1811, the emperor Alexander I founded a school which he called by the French name of <i>lyc�e </i>(<i>litsei </i>in Russian) in the imperial village of Tsarskoe Selo, some eighteen miles south of Petersburg, to give the sons of the aristocracy a European education, after which they were to take up important posts in govern�ment service. Pushkin was in the first class of thirty, and his years at the lyc�e remained central to his life. There he began to write poetry, first in French, then in Russian, and by the age of fourteen he had already seen his work published and praised. On graduating in 1817, he moved to Petersburg, where he held a nominal post in the service, which did not keep him from living a rather wild life, gambling, wom�anizing, dueling. In Petersburg he also got to know some of the young officers who had come back from&nbsp;Paris. He shared their thoughts and hopes, and in that spirit wrote a number of poems which were not very pleasing to the authorities. One of them, the ode &#x201c;Liberty,&#x201d; written as early as 1817, praises &#x201c;the exalted son of Gaul&#x201d; who sang of Liberty and denounced &#x201c;enthroned vice&#x201d; with its scourges, irons, and serfdom. Against &#x201c;lawless Authority&#x201d; it invokes &#x201c;the trustworthy shelter of the Law.&#x201d; This, along with some biting epigrams on various government officials, was finally too much even for the rather liberal Alexander. Pushkin was relieved of his post in Petersburg and &#x201c;exiled&#x201d; to the south, to serve in Ekaterinoslav, Kishinev, and finally Odessa.<br><br>Pushkin was absent from Petersburg from 1820 to 1826. During those years he wrote a great deal of poetry, some of it based on his travels to the Caucasus and the Crimea with General Nikolai Raevsky, a retired hero of the Napoleonic Wars, and his sons Alexander and Nikolai, who became his close friends. He detested life in backward Kishinev, which had been ceded to Russia by the Turks in 1812, man�aged to get transferred to Odessa, but caused himself trouble there as well, particularly with the beautiful young wife of the governor-general, Prince Mikhail Vorontsov. He wrote a notorious epigram about the governor-general:<br><br> Half milord, half merchant,<br> Half wise man, half ignoramus,<br> Half scoundrel, but there&#x2019;s hope<br> He&#x2019;ll finally become a full one.<br>The post office routinely opened Pushkin&#x2019;s mail, and in one let�ter found him sympathizing with the atheistic arguments of a local philosopher (a certain &#x201c;deaf Englishman&#x201d;). This was enough to allow Vorontsov to petition for Pushkin&#x2019;s removal from Odessa. By imperial order he&nbsp;was expelled from the service and confined to his mother&#x2019;s small estate at Mikhailovskoe, near Pskov, where he was to be kept under surveillance by his father and the local authorities.<br><br>In a way the two years of this &#x201c;house arrest&#x201d; were Pushkin&#x2019;s sal�vation. He was left free to read and to write, and he produced more than he had in the previous four years. Along with many of his finest lyric poems, which went into the collection he was gathering then and published in 1826, he finished his long poem <i>The Gypsies, </i>begun in Kishinev, wrote two more long poems, <i>The Bridegroom </i>and the comic parody <i>Count Nulin, </i>completed three chapters of his novel in verse <i>Evgeny Onegin, </i>and wrote his first and longest play, the historical trag�edy <i>Boris Godunov. </i>And he worked on yet another narrative poem, <i>Cleopatra, </i>parts of which eventually found their way into the prose/verse fragment <i>Egyptian Nights, </i>included in our collection.<br><br>In a letter to his brother in November 1824, he describes his typi�cal day: &#x201c;I write memoirs until dinner; I dine late. After dinner I ride on horseback. In the evening I listen to fairy tales, and thereby I am compensating for the insufficiencies of my accursed upbringing. How charming these fairy tales are!&#x201d; The storyteller was his former nanny, the house serf Arina Rodionovna, who at first was his only company on the estate. Pushkin was deeply struck by her tales, kept notes on them, and a few years later turned them into some of his finest poems: <i>Tsar Saltan, The Golden Cockerel, </i>and <i>The Dead Princess and the Seven Mighty Men. </i>He also collected her sayings and expressions, a trove of Russian speech that was part of the compensation for his &#x201c;accursed upbringing.&#x201d;<br><br>But his confinement to Mikhailovskoe saved him in a more literal sense as well. The young officers who had come back from France began to organize a movement for political reform and&nbsp;in 1816 founded a secret society called the Union of Salvation, based in Petersburg with branches in other cities. The Union later divided into the Northern Society in Petersburg and the Southern Society in the Ukraine. Their aims included the abolition of serfdom, the election of a legislative assembly, and the drafting of a constitution limiting the powers of the monarchy. The Southern Society, led by Colonel Pavel Pestel, went further, advocating universal suffrage and the abolition of the monar�chy. Both foresaw the inevitability of an armed uprising.<br>Their chance came in December 1825. The emperor Alexander died suddenly on December 1, at the age of forty-eight, leaving no direct heir. The elder of his two brothers, Constantine, had married a Polish woman and Roman Catholic, and had renounced his right of succession, but only Alexander knew of it. There was uncertainty for several weeks before the younger brother, Nicholas, was prevailed upon to accept the throne. The secret societies decided to take the opportunity of his coronation on December 26 to stage their uprising, earning themselves the name of Decembrists. Some three thousand soldiers, led by the young officers of the Northern Society, appeared in Senate Square in Petersburg, calling for the formation of a pro�visional government. A few days later the Southern Society incited a mutiny among the troops in the Ukraine. But the revolts were poorly organized and, after the initial shock, were quickly suppressed. The instigators were arrested; five of them, including Colonel Pestel and the poet Kondraty Ryleev, were executed, and another 120 were sent into permanent exile in Siberia.<br><br>Pushkin, like many of his young friends, shared the liberal ideas of the Decembrists. The Raevsky brothers had joined the Southern Society, though they pulled out of it some time before the uprising. He had made the acquaintance of Pestel during his time in Kishinev and had been struck by his forceful personality. Later, as he records in <i>Journey to Arzrum, </i>Pushkin ran into many former Decembrists who had been sent to serve in the Caucasus as &#x201c;punishment&#x201d; for their radi�cal views. In September 1826, during a private meeting in Moscow, the new emperor asked him where he would have been on December 26. Pushkin replied candidly: &#x201c;On Senate Square with the rebels.&#x201d;<br><br>That conversation took place soon after Nicholas decided to end Pushkin&#x2019;s exile. A messenger brought the news to Mikhailovskoe. Pushkin left the same day and on September 8 arrived in Moscow. The emperor met with him at once and explained his new situation. His work would no longer be subject to official censorship; instead it would be submitted for approval to the emperor himself. Pushkin, charmed by Nicholas&#x2019;s apparent benevolence during their meeting, took that as an honor, not ...</p><h2>Elegy On Toy Piano (Pitt Poetry Series)</h2><p><p>In <i>Elegy on Toy Piano</i>, Dean Young's sixth book of poems, elegiac necessity finds itself next to goofy celebration. Daffy Duck enters the Valley of the Eternals. Faulkner and bell-bottoms cling to beauty's evanescence. </p><p>Even in single poems, Young's tone and style vary. No one feeling or idea takes precedence over another, and their simultaneity is frequently revealed; sadness may throw a squirrelly shadow, joy can find itself dressed in mourning black. As in the agitated "Whirlpool Suite": "Pain / and pleasure are two signals carried / over one phoneline." </p><p>In taking up subjects as slight as the examination of a signature or a true/false test, and as pressing as the death of friends, Young's poems embrace the duplicity of feeling, the malleability of perception, and the truth telling of wordplay.</p></p><p><b>Dean Young</b> has published several books of poetry, including his 2005 collection, <i>Elegy on Toy Piano</i>,<b> a</b><b>finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in Poetry</b>. His collection <i>Skid</i> was a finalist for the Lenore Marshall Prize. Young has received two National Endowment for the Arts fellowships as well as a Guggenheim Fellowship. He teaches at The Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa and in the Warren Wilson Low Residency Program.Staccato and frantic, created by long series of declarative end-stopped lines, Young's sixth collection confidently balances moments of absurdity against high drama and raw admissions of emotion: "Our camouflage works best/ galloping <i>en masse </i>in discotheques./ We are very gentle with our young." The book is dedicated to the late Kenneth Koch; when Young writes of a power drill telling a canoe, "You don't have a clue," he really means it. The title poem recalls something of Auden's elegy for Yeats, in sentiment if not in tone, and slyly contains self-doubt: "His work has enlarged the world/ but the world is about to stop including him./ He is the tower the world runs out of." When Young's poetry works, his particular mix of the silly and the deadly serious increases the poignancy of the poems, so that in the first poem a long series of unconnected images and references (Marilyn Monroe, a squirrel hanging on a transformer, a third-grader "loose in dishwares") culminates heartrendingly in this question: "Will we never see our dead friends again?" This book of energetic, chronic juxtaposition pieces together a winning, tinkling set of send-offs for friends, and for feelings. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

What made you decide to update? </b><br> As I wrote in my 2011 book, <i>Markets Never Forget</i>, particularly following big bear markets, investors tend think "now" is different somehow. That problems we face are unique and insurmountable somehow. But folks always think that, and they're always wrong--we just forget.<br><br> Following the 2008 credit crisis and bear market and the huge 2009-2010 boom off the bottom, I thought I could revisit the questions to show, first, details change, but human behavior doesn't--not fast enough. And second, to show that if you have a good strategy aimed at knowing what others don't, that can work no matter what the market environment, what just happened or how much people think the world has changed. Nothing works 100% of the time, and things that worked once stop working then start working again later. But if you have a good, scientific method aimed at knowing what others don't--that should serve you well, always. And in updating the book, it was amazing how well the questions and all the examples I used held up.<br><br> <b>The financial world has changed quite a bit since 2007--new laws and regulations. How do the three questions still matter in the new financial landscape?</b><br> I'd argue the financial world is always changing. Sometimes new regulations are big, sometimes small. There are new innovations constantly. The three questions hold up because they aren't static. They don't rely on rules of thumb that maybe worked a long time ago but now are worthless. They are flexible and form a scientific method helping you see the world more clearly, no matter how much regulations change or new innovations are introduced.<br><br> <b>Why would someone who bought the original book need this updated edition?</b><br> I've updated nearly every chart and table in the book and most all the data. Plus, there's some updated commentary based on the most recent market cycle that obviously wasn't in the first edition. I've edited it to be a tighter read and a better tool, so readers of the first edition might find something more useful or more powerful in this one.<br><br> <b>What do you mean when you say that the only way to beat the market is by knowing what others don't know?</b><br> I mean exactly what finance theory says is true, and what is taught in every classroom and in every professional internship but most people seem to forget when faced with the real world. The only way to bet and win more often than not is knowing something others don't. If you don't know something others don't and make a market bet, you might be lucky sometimes and right but probably more often unlucky and wrong. That's not a strategy for long-term investing success.<br><br> <b>The world is more interconnected now than ever before. How has this changed the way people approach investment decisions?</b><br> In my mind, this is part of a long innovation evolution and in many ways is good. It means there's more information moving faster, which can add to transparency.<br><br> But for many investors, the non-stop interconnectedness results in nonstop noise--most of it nonsense. But much of the nonsensical noise looks to many like wisdom--it can be hard for folks to weed through the nonsense to find something useful. If you can do that--ignore the noise--there's so much more you can know now that others don't. But ignoring the noise is a hard skill and most don't try developing it.<br><br> My sense is if most folks ignored their TVs and computers for a solid year, they'd have much better investing results than they would have otherwise. They'd be less tempted to make investing moves just for the sake of moving, and that alone can improve results.<br><br>In his groundbreaking bestseller, <i>The Only Three Questions That Count</i>, investment expert and longtime Forbes columnist Ken Fisher taught investors to question traditional investing wisdom, interrogate long-held market beliefs and, most importantly, to challenge themselves. And now, in <i>The Only Three Questions That Still Count</i>, he's back demonstrating that the path to better investment results remains knowing what others don't. <p>Most investors know the only way to consistently achieve investing success is by knowing things that others don't. Yet many investors believe they don't or can't know what others don't&#x2014;so they continue making market bets based on "conventional wisdom." In the updated edition of <i>The Only Three Questions That Count</i>, Fisher debunks the conventional market myths that many investment decisions are based upon. And he reveals a methodology that allows investors to discover unknown or underappreciated information&#x2014;information that can form the basis of a market bet.</p> <p>And the methodology is as easy as asking three questions. The first helps you see things as they really are. The second question helps you see things other investors often miss. And the third will help you keep your unruly brain in line. Investing is a non-stop query session&#x2014;this book hands you tools that should serve you the rest of your investing career.</p> <p>Thoroughly revised and updated, this new edition features new content and updated graphs and data. Packed with images, practical advice and anecdotes that show Fisher's ideas in action, the book helps you question how you think about the market, its component parts and even individual stocks. Taken together, Fisher's three questions can help you make better investment decisions by identifying what you&#x2014;and you alone&#x2014;can know and how you can profit from it.</p> <p>The key to better investment returns is daring to challenge yourself and what you believe to be true, and in <i>The Only Three Questions That Still Count</i>, Ken Fisher explains how, in his own inimitable style&#x2014;giving you the tools you need to outthink the market.</p></p><h2>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave</h2><p>Written more than a century ago by Frederick Douglass, a former slave who went on to become a famous orator, U.S. minister, and a leader of his people, this masterpiece is one of the most eloquent indictments of slavery ever recorded.

Victor Hugo&#39;s tale of injustice, heroism and love follows the fortunes of Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), an escaped convict determined to put his criminal past behind him. But his attempts to become a respected member of the community are constantly put under threat: by his own conscience, when, owing to a case of mistaken identity, another man is arrested in his place; and by the relentless investigations of the dogged Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe). It is not simply for himself that Valjean must stay free, however, for he has sworn to protect the baby daughter of Fantine (Anne Hathaway), driven to prostitution by poverty. Victor Hugo (1802-85) wrote volumes of criticism, Romantic costume dramas, satirical verse and political journalism but is best remembered for his novels, especially Notre-Dame de Paris (1831), also known as The Hunchback of Notre-Dame and Les Mis�rables (1862) which was adapted into one of the most successful musicals of all time. &#39;All human life is here&#39; Cameron Mackintosh, producer of the musical Les Mis�rables &#39;One of the half-dozen greatest novels of the world&#39; Upton Sinclair &#39;A great writer - inventive, witty, sly, innovatory&#39; A. S. Byatt, author of Possession</p><p>Victor Hugo (1802-85) was the most forceful, prolific and versatile of French nineteenth-century writers. He wrote Romantic costume dramas, many volumes of lyrical and satirical verse, political and other journalism, criticism and several novels, the best known of which are Les Mis�rables (1862) and the youthful Notre-Dame de Paris (1831). A royalist and conservative as a young man, Hugo later became a committed social democrat and during the Second Empire of Napoleon III was exiled from France, living in the Channel Islands. He returned to Paris in 1870 and remained a great public figure until his death: his body lay in state under the Arc de Triomphe before being buried in the Panth�on.From the Introduction by Peter Washington- Victor Hugo might be regarded as the Mr Toad of French literature: vain, arrogrant, pompous, selfish, cold and stingy; a windbag, a humbug and a fraud, absurdly puffed up with the immensity of his own greatness. But unlike Mr Toad, he was also an astute and energetic promoter of hisown image as a Great Man. The process began early. Writing in Hugo&#39;s lifetime, Virginie Ancelot recalls the reception the young poet received in literary drawing-rooms when he arrived to read his latest ode. &#34;...There was a few moments&#39; silence; then someone rose and approached him with visible emotion, took his hand and raised their eyes to heaven.The multitude listened. A single word was heard, to the great surprise of the uninitiated. And this word, which echoed in every corner of the salon, was:&#39;Cathedral!&#39;Then the orator returned to his place; another rose and cried out: &#39;Ogive!&#39;A third looked round him and ventured:&#39;Egyptian Pyramid!&#39;The assembly applauded, and then it was lost in profound reflection.&#34; To the Anglo-Saxon mind - and, it should be said, to many Frenchmen - this is Parisian literary life at its worst: the posturing, the pretension, the self-regard, masquerading under the name of art. Yet Hugo is the man who wrote a handful of the most exquisite lyrics - &#39;Victor Hugo, helas!&#39;said Gide when someone asked him to name the finest French poet - and at least one novel judged to be supreme. In his person, he sums up all that is most monsterous in writerly vanity; in his best work he transcended his failings. How did he do it? How did a monster come to write the masterpiece that is Les Miserables? * In an early essay on Scott, Hugo prophesies that&#34;After the picturesque but prosaic novel of Walter Scott, there will still be another novel to create ... It is the novel which is at once drama and epic, picturesque and poetic, real and ieal, true and great, the novel which will enshrine Walter Scott in Homer.&#34;These words were written in 1823, just after the publication of his own first novel, Han d&#39;Islande, and there is no doubt that Hugo had himself in mind as the man who could &#39;enshrine Walter Scott as Homer&#39;. Anyone who can still get through this book may take a rather different view. Set in seventeeth-century Norway and dripping with gore on every page, Han d&#39;Islande is nearer to the Gothic horror tradition than to Scott. For the man who really succeeded in reconciling the genres of epic and historic fiction we have to look further afield, to Hugo&#39;s own admirerer, Tolstoy. Yet it was Tolstoy who vindicated the French novelist&#39;s early ambition by judging Les Miserables one of the world&#39;s great novels, if not the greates, and acknowledged its effect on his own work. Les Miserables was completed in 1862, shortly before the Russian novelist began War and Peace. The two novels are set in the same period. It cannot be said that Hugo had much to teach his junior about structure or characterization; like all his attempts at epic, in prose and verse, Les Miserables rambles, there are huge digressions and absurdities of plot, the characters are often thin, the action melodramatic. But in spacious, vigorous story-telling, in the use of an historical framework, in the relating of human events to a larger philosophical and spiritual context, in the deployment of fiction as a social and political weapon, in the exalatation of &#39;the people&#39; as a supreme authority, in the treatment of suffering as a dominant theme - in all these matters, Hugo exerted a profound influence on Tolstoy. Without his example, War and Peace might have been a very different novel. Perhaps the most extraordinary point of contact between them concerns Napoleon. One might expect the emperor to intrigue European writers in the early nineteenth century, as he intrigues Byron, Balzac and Stendhal, among others, but by the 1860s almost half a century had passed since Waterloo, yet Hugo and Tolstoy are still trying to unravel the mystery of one whose shadow falls across the entire century. For Tolstoy, Napoleon is pre-eminently a human being - an extraordinary man, certainly, the instrument of destiny, but still a man. For Hugo he is more like a superman, a mysterious brooding presence with almost divine powers. The point is made by an ironic comparison between Napoleon and Wellington. Hugo&#39;s argument seems to be that Napoleon ought to have won Waterloo by sheer force of genius - indeed, that he did win it, when judged according to the rules of natural justice - but that Wellington achieved a victory on points by taking more care to spy out the lay of the battlefield and to estimate the balance of forces. Calculation is everything to the mundane Englishman, imagination nothing. When lightning flashes round the emperor&#39;s head, the duke looks like a very ordinary man. While Napoleon surveys the heavens, Wellington consults his watch. Clearly, the image of general as genius was vital to Hugo&#39;s own project of himself as a literary Napoleon, but there is more to it than that. Commentators have often lamented the digression on Waterloo which is quite unnecessary to the plot and, coming early in the book, throws it decisively out of its narrative stride. But Hugo, though careless of structural refinement, does have a more serious purpose here - a purpose from which Tolstoy must have learnt much, and not only in his description of Borodino. For Hugo, who in turn learnt so much from Scott, grasped the fact that by imprinting the significance of a decisive historical moment on the minds of his readers he could hugely enlarge the scope of his novel. Precisely because Les Miserables is about little people, the history of a great man is one means of linking their petty lives with the Infinite. (The link is made touchingly explicit in the chapter called &#39;In Which Little Gavroche Takes Advantage of Napoleon the Great&#39;.) Even events as great as Waterloo, we are told, can hinge on details: the location of a ditch, the arrival of a platoon. Conversely, the most trivial life may exemplify a great truth - and in that sense, all lives are equally significant, for every existence embodies these truths. At the same time, Hugo&#39;s treatment of Waterloo makes it clear that realities and appearances diverge as much in everyday life as they do in historical interpretation - and that the two divergences are linked. What a post-Waterloo Frenchman thinks of Napoleon helps to shape what he thinks of himself. Sometimes we try to envision history in our own image; sometimes we use it to understand ourselves; at all times we are formed by it without our knowledge. One function of fiction is to help us achieve that knowledge. Les Miserables is, among other things, an attempt to explain the people of the mid-nineteenth century to themselves. Jean Valjean finds himself in a certain situation because he is a poor Frenchman at a particular time. This is one version of Fate - the sociological and political explanation of things. But Valjean is like Waterloo: his life also has a deeper purpose, a hidden meaning. Hugo has a number of names for this meaning - Fate, Destiny, God, the Infinite. But whatever he calls it, we observe a complex dialogue throughout the book between the surface causes of Valjean&#39;s predicament - poverty and ignorance - and their deeper meaning, to which he penetrates through suffering.</p><h2>The Grammar of Graphics (Statistics and Computing)</h2><p><p>Presents a unique foundation for producing almost every quantitative graphic found in scientific journals, newspapers, statistical packages, and data visualization systems</p> <p>The new edition features six new chapters and has undergone substantial revision.</p> <p>The first edition has sold more than 2200 copies.</p> <p>Four color throughout.</p></p><p><p>This book was written for statisticians, computer scientists, geographers, researchers, and others interested in visualizing data.

As the Hottentot Venus, she was seen by Westerners as alluring and primitive, a reflection of their fears and suppressed desires. But who was Sara Baartman? Who was the woman who became the Hottentot Venus? Based on research and interviews that span three continents, <i>Sara Baartman and the Hottentot Venus</i> tells the entwined histories of an illusive life and a famous icon. In doing so, the book raises questions about the possibilities and limits of biography for understanding those who live between and among different cultures.</p><br><p> In reconstructing Baartman's life, the book traverses the South African frontier and its genocidal violence, cosmopolitan Cape Town, the ending of the slave trade, the Industrial Revolution, the French Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, London and Parisian high society, and the rise of racial science. The authors discuss the ramifications of discovering that when Baartman went to London, she was older than originally assumed, and they explore the enduring impact of the Hottentot Venus on ideas about women, race, and sexuality. The book concludes with the politics involved in returning Baartman's remains to her home country, and connects Baartman's story to her descendants in nineteenth- and twentieth-century South Africa.</p><br><br><p> <i>Sara Baartman and the Hottentot Venus</i> offers the authoritative account of one woman's life and reinstates her to the full complexity of her history.</p></p><p><p>"Finally, an authoritative account of the mythologized life of Sara Baartman. The meticulously researched subject comes to life in the hands of historians Crais and Scully, who skillfully negotiate the pitfalls of writing historical biography. The authors make a delicate distinction between the woman, Sara Baartman, and the iconic Hottentot Venus, in this elegantly written, passionate, compassionate, and carefully contextualized study, in which their findings are nevertheless unflinchingly presented. Magnificent--an outstanding contribution to South African culture, past and present."<b>--Zo� Wicomb, author of <i>You Can't Get Lost in Cape Town</i></b></p><p>"Crais and Scully have produced a definitive study of Sara Baartman and the many lives of the so-called Hottentot Venus. This is a wonderful book that has both intellectual interest and emotional power--I think it will be established as the authoritative account."<b>--Elizabeth Elbourne, McGill University</b></p><p>"An eloquently written story demonstrating meticulous archival research, this book makes an important contribution to scholarly debates about biography. Using a range of previously unrecovered sources, Crais and Scully apply their theoretical insights about 'heterography' to the life of Sara Baartman, moving well beyond her role as the Hottentot Venus by reclaiming her life in the fullness of lived experience."<b>--Kerry Ward, Rice University</b></p><p>"In the very act of demonstrating the impossibility of knowing Sarah Baartman, the authors of this remarkable book have restored her humanity. This is less a biography than an anti-biography, a searing work of social history that acknowledges the deep silence that surrounds so much of human history. A richly researched and deeply moving work."<b>--Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, author of <i>Well-Behaved Women Seldom Make History</i></b></p><b>Clifton Crais</b> is professor of history at Emory University.

The unique pedagogical framework includes The Problem, Sources and Method, The Evidence, Questions to Consider, and Epilogue and Evaluation sections in each chapter. This structure promotes critical thinking, sharpens analytical skills, and builds student interest in the subject matter. DISCOVERING THE WESTERN PAST: A LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE, Volume II: Since 1500, Seventh Edition, emphasizes historical study as interpretation rather than memorization of data, with actual documents and artifacts from which students develop answers to historical questions--and learn to think like historians.

But the deceptively gentle Lady Slane has other ideas. First she defies the patronizing meddling of her children and escapes to a rented house in Hampstead. There, to her offspring&#x2019;s utter amazement, she revels in her new freedom, recalls her youthful ambitions, and gathers some very unsuitable companions&#x2014;who reveal to her just how much she had sacrificed under the pressure of others&#x2019; expectations.</p><p>VITA SACKVILLE-WEST (1892-1962) was a writer and poet born in England to aristocratic parents. In 1913, she married diplomat Harold Nicolson and traveled extensively before settling in 1930 at Sissinghurst Castle, where she designed a world-famous garden. Sackville-West had an affair with Virginia Woolf and was the model for the protagonist of Woolf&#x2019;s <i>Orlando.</i> She is best known for her novels, including <i>The Edwardians</i> and <i>All Passion Spent</i>.Henry Lyulph Holland, first Earl of Slane, had existed for so long that the public had begun to regard him as immortal. The public, as a whole, finds reassurance in longevity, and, after the necessary interlude of reaction, is disposed to recognise extreme old age as a sign of excellence. The long-liver has triumphed over at least one of man&#x2019;s initial handicaps: the brevity of life. To filch twenty years from eternal annihilation is to impose one&#x2019;s superiority on an allotted programme. So small is the scale upon which we arrange our values. It was thus with a start of real incredulity that City men, opening their papers in the train on a warm May morning, read that Lord Slane, at the age of ninety-four, had passed away suddenly after dinner on the previous evening. &#x2018;Heart failure,&#x2019; they said sagaciously, though they were actually quoting from the papers; and then added with a sigh, &#x2018;Well, another old landmark gone.&#x2019; That was the dominant feeling: another old landmark gone, another reminder of insecurity. All the events and progressions of Henry Holland&#x2019;s life were gathered up and recorded in a final burst of publicity by the papers; they were gathered together into a handful as hard as a cricket-ball, and flung in the faces of the public, from the days of his &#x2018;brilliant university career,&#x2019; through the days when Mr Holland, at an astonishingly early age, had occupied a seat in the Cabinet, to this very last day when as Earl of Slane, K.G., G.C.B., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., etc. etc. &#x2013; his diminishing honours trailing away behind him like the tail of a comet &#x2013; he had drooped in his chair after dinner, and the accumulation of ninety years had receded abruptly into history. Time seemed to have made a little jump forward, now that the figure of old Slane was no longer there with outstretched arms to dam it back. For some fifteen years he had taken no very active part in public life, but he had been there, and on occasion the irrefutable suavity, common sense, and mockery of his eloquence in Parliament had disturbed, though it could not actually arrest, his more extreme colleagues upon the brink of folly. Such pronouncements had been rare, for Henry Holland had always been a man to appreciate the value of economy, but by their very rarity they produced a wholesome sense of uneasiness, since men knew them to be backed up by a legend of experience: if the old man, the octogenarian, the nonagenarian, could bestir himself to the extent of stalking down to Westminster and unburdening himself, in his incomparable way, of opinions carefully, soberly, but cynically gestated, then the Press and the public were compelled into attention. Nobody had ever seriously attacked Lord Slane. Nobody had ever accused Lord Slane of being a back-number. His humour, his charm, his languor, and his good sense, had rendered him sacrosanct to all generations and to all parties; of him alone among statesmen and politicians, perhaps, could that be said. Perhaps, because he seemed to have touched life on every side, and yet never seemed to have touched life, the common life, at all, by virtue of his proverbial detachment, he had never drawn upon himself the execration and mistrust commonly accorded to the mere expert. Hedonist, humanist, sportsman, philosopher, scholar, charmer, wit; one of those rare Englishmen whose fortune it is to be born equipped with a truly adult mind. His colleagues and his subordinates had been alternately delighted and infuriated by his assumed reluctance to deal with any practical question. It was difficult to get a yes or a no out of the man. The more important a question was, the more flippantly he dealt with it. &#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; he would write at the bottom of a memorandum setting forth the advantages of two opposite lines of policy; and his myrmidons passed their hands over their brows, distraught. He was destroyed as a statesman, they said, because he always saw both sides of the case; but even as they said it with exasperation, they did not mean it, for they knew that on occasion, when finally pushed into a corner, he would be more incisive, more deadly, than any man seated four-square and full of importance at a governmental desk. He could cast his eye over a report, and pick out its heart and its weakness before another man had had time to read it through. In his exquisitely courteous way, he would annihilate alike the optimism and the myopia of his correspondent. Courteous always, and civilised, he left his competitors dead.<br><br>&nbsp;His personal idiosyncrasies, too, were dear to the public as to the caricaturists; his black satin stock, his eyeglass swung on an extravagantly wide ribbon, the coral buttons to his evening waistcoat, the private hansom he maintained long after motors had come into fashion &#x2013; by all this was he buttressed through the confused justice and injustice of legend; and when, at the age of eighty-five, he finally succeeded in winning the Derby, no man ever received a greater ovation. His wife alone suspected how closely those idiosyncrasies were associated with a settled policy. The least cynical of people by nature, she had learned to lay a veneer of cynicism over herself after seventy years&#x2019; association with Henry Holland. &#x2018;Dear old man,&#x2019; said the City men in the train; &#x2018;well, he&#x2019;s gone.&#x2019;<br><br>He was gone indeed, very finally and irretrievably gone. So thought his widow, looking down at him as he lay on his bed in Elm Park Gardens. The blinds were not lowered, for he had always stipulated that when he came to die the house should not be darkened, and even after his death nobody would have dreamed of disobeying his orders. He lay there in the full sunlight, sparing the stone-mason the trouble of carving his effigy. His favourite great-grandchild, to whom everything was permitted, had often twitted him, saying that he would make a handsome corpse; and now that the joke had become a reality, the reality gained in impressiveness for having been anticipated by a joke. His was the type of face which, even in life, one associates prophetically with the high dignity of death. The bony architecture of nose, chin, and temples, stood out in greater relief for the slight sinking of the flesh; the lips took a firmer line, and a lifetime of wisdom lay sealed behind them. Moreover, and most importantly, Lord Slane looked as soign� in death as he had looked in life. &#x2018;Here,&#x2019; you would say, even though the bedclothes covered him, &#x2018;is a dandy.&#x2019;<br><br>Yet, for all its dignity, death brought a revelation. The face which had been so noble in life lost a trifle of its nobility in death; the lips which had been too humorous to be unpleasantly sardonic now betrayed their thinness; the carefully concealed ambition now revealed itself fully in the proud curve of the nostril. The hardness which had disguised itself under the charming manner now remained alone, robbed of the protection of a smile. He was beautiful, but he was less agreeable. Alone in the room his widow contemplated him, filled with thoughts that would greatly have surprised her children, could they but have read her mind.<br><br>Her children, however, were not there to observe her. They were collected in the drawing-room, all six of them; two wives and a husband bringing the number up to nine. A sufficiently formidable family gathering &#x2013; old, black ravens, thought Edith, the youngest, who was always flustered and always trying to confine things into the shape of a phrase, like pouring water into a ewer, but great gouts of meaning and implication invariably ran over and slopped about and were lost. To attempt to recapture them after they had spilt was as hopeless as trying to hold the water in your hand. Perhaps, if one had a notebook and pencil always ready &#x2013; but then the thought would be lost while one was looking for the right word; and, moreover, it would be difficult to use a notebook without everybody seeing. Shorthand? &#x2013; but one must not let one&#x2019;s thoughts run on like this; one must discipline one&#x2019;s mind, keeping one&#x2019;s attention on the present matter, as other people seemed to do without any difficulty; though, to be sure, if one had not learnt that lesson by the time one was sixty, one was never likely to learn it. A formidable family gathering, thought Edith, coming back: Herbert, Carrie, Charles, William, and Kay; Mabel, Lavinia; Roland. They went in groups: the Hollands themselves, the sisters-in-law, the brother-in-law; then they sorted themselves differently: Herbert and Mabel, Carrie and Roland; Charles; William and Lavinia; and then Kay all by himself. It was not often that they all met together, none missing &#x2013; curious, Edith thought, that Death should be the convener, as though all the living rushed instantly together for protection and mutual support. Dear me, how old we all are. Herbert must be sixty-eight, and I&#x2019;m sixty; and Father was over ninety, and Mother is eighty-eight. Edith, who had begun making a sum of their total ages, surprised them all very much by asking, &#x2018;How old are you, Lavinia?&#x2019; Thus taken aback, they rebuked Edith by their stare; but that was Edith all over, she never listened to what was being said, and then suddenly came out with some irrelevant remark. Edith could have told them that all her life she had been trying to say what she meant, and had never yet succeeded. Only too often, she said something precisely the opposite of what she wanted to say. Her terror was that she should one day use an indecent word by mistake. &#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t it splendid that Father is dead,&#x2019; she might say, instead of, &#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t it terrible&#x2019;; and there were other possibilities, even more appalling, by which one might use a really dreadful word,&nbsp; the sort of word that butcher-boys scrawled in pencil on the white-washed walls of the basement passage, and about which one had to speak, most evasively, to the cook. An unpleasant task; the sort of task that fell to Edith in Elm Park Gardens and to a thousand Ediths all over London. But of these preoccupations her family knew nothing.<br><br>They were gratified now to see that she blushed, and that her hands went up nervously to fiddle with the grey strands of her hair; the gesture implied that she had not spoken. Having reduced her to this confusion, they returned to their conversation, suitably hushed and mournful. Even the voices of Herbert and Carrie, habitually insistent, were lowered. Their father lay upstairs, and their mother was with him.<br><br>&#x2018;Mother is wonderful.&#x2019;<br><br>Over and over, thought Edith, they had reiterated that phrase. Surprise was in their accents, as though they had expected their mother to rant, rave, scream, give herself up for lost. Edith knew very well that her brothers and sister privately entertained a theory that their mother was rather a simpleton. From time to time she let fall remarks that could not be reconciled with ordinary sense; she had no grasp on the world as it was; she was apt to say impetuous things which, although uttered in English, made no more sense than had they been uttered in an outer-planetary language. Mother was a changeling, they had often said politely, in the bitter-sweet accents reserved for a family joke; but now in this emergency they found a new phrase: Mother is wonderful. It was the thing they were expected to say, so they said it, several times over, like a refrain coming periodically into their conversation and sweeping it upwards on to a higher level. Then it drooped again; became practical. Mother was wonderful, but what was to be done with Mother? Evidently, she could not go on being wonderful for the rest of her life. Somewhere, somehow, she must be allowed to break down, and then, after that was over, must be stowed away; housed, taken care of. Outside, in the streets, the posters might flare: death of Lord Slane. The journalists might run up and down Fleet Street assembling their copy; they might pounce on the pigeon-holes &#x2013; that macabre columbarium &#x2013; where the obituary notices were stored in readiness; they might raid each other&#x2019;s information: &#x2018;I say, is it true that old Slane always carried his cash in coppers? wore cr�pe soles? dipped his bread in his coffee?&#x2019; Anything to make a good paragraph. Telegraph-boys might ring the bell, propping their red bicycles against the kerb, delivering their brown messages of condolence, from all over the world, from all parts of the Empire, especially where Lord Slane had served his term of government. Florists might deliver their wreaths &#x2013; already the narrow hall was full of them &#x2013; &#x2018;indecently soon,&#x2019; said Herbert, peering jealously nevertheless at the attached cards through his monocle. Old friends might call &#x2013; &#x2018;Herbert &#x2013; so dreadfully sudden &#x2013; of course, I didn&#x2019;t expect to see your dear Mother&#x2014;&#x2019; But obviously they had expected it, had expected to be the sole exception, and Herbert must turn them away, rather enjoying it: &#x2018;Mother, you understand, is naturally rather overcome; wonderful, I must say; but just at present, you&#x2019;ll understand, I&#x2019;m sure, is seeing nobody but Us&#x2019;; and so with many pressings of Herbert&#x2019;s hand they took their departure, having got no further than the hall or the doorstep. Reporters might loiter on the pavement, dangling cameras like black concertinas. All this might go on outside the house, but inside it, upstairs, Mother was with Father and the problem of her future lay heavy upon her sons and daughters.</p><h2>The Ways of Religion: An Introduction to the Major Traditions</h2><p>Revised and updated, the third edition of this highly acclaimed anthology surveys all the major religious traditions--Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and African religions--and also covers Zen Buddhism, Shinto, and the religious experience in America. Ideal for courses in world religions and comparative religion, it introduces the unique claims, hopes, and wisdom of each tradition in its own voice, through substantial excerpts from its scriptures, prophets, and authors. "I have tried to pay heed," Eastman writes in his Preface, "to A. C. Bouquet's warning of many years ago that the study of religion may sink to the level of collecting dead insects or pressed flowers, which in the process lose all their color and reality. There is not much excuse for a dreary book about a subject as inherently interesting and provocative as the world's religions." <br> The following selections are new to the third edition: Diana L. Eck's "Frontiers of Encounter," Barbara Stoler Miller on Yoga, R. K. Narayan's story "Chudala," Julia Ching's "Confucianism in Perspective," Thomas Merton on Chuang Tzu, Joseph M. Kitagawa's "The Way of the Kami," Ian Reader on Shinto, Vincent Mulago on African Religions, and "A Personal Note" by John Hick.<br></p><p>Roger Eastman is at Reedley College."A very rich source to enable students to get a 'taste' of influential traditions."--Mary Anne Foley, University of Scranton<br><br>"A very creative, interesting introduction to world religions--a hybrid text."--Gaston Espinosa, Westmont College<br><br>"An outstanding anthology and clear expositions."--Allen Howard Podet, Buffalo State College<br><br>"An excellent supplementary book for World Religions courses because it quotes primary sources."--Marianne Ferguson, Buffalo State College<br><br>"Excellent selection from recent studies of religion from the original texts. Eastman covers a great deal of ground in 500 pages and does it carefully and intelligently."--Dan O'Bryan, Sierra Nevada College<br><br>"An excellent survey for use in introductory level courses at the seminary level. It helps to bring students into the world of religion beyond the Judeo-Christian tradition."--Philip Wickari, San Francisco Theological Seminary/Graduate Theological Union<br><br>"A thorough, comprehensive book with a variety of presentations to meet different kinds of audiences."--Ralph R. Covell, Denver Seminary<br><br>"The Ways of Religion was just what I was looking for. It provides substantial sections of writings (including Scripture) from various traditions without being overwhelming to students. Its inclusion of contemporary writings adds to it relevancy as well."--Joel J. Heim, Carroll College<br><br>Praise for the previous edition (first 4 quotes): "In my twenty-five years of teaching world religions this is the first book on the subject that I have liked, with the sole exception of Huston Smith's World Religions. Unlike the latter, this is an anthology and a very excellent one at that.<br>Eastman's book will be a boon to students."--Ramesh Patel, Antioch College<br><br>"An excellent mixture of restrained but clear commentary with multiple selections of primary texts from the great traditions of humankind. The sense and sentiment, taste and feel emerge from the stories and sacred texts."--Michael Barnes, University of Dayton</p><h2>A Survey of Choral Music</h2><p>In this brief text, Homer Ulrich offers students a history of choral music that is as rich and fascinating as the genre itself. Emphasizing those works that represent historical or stylistic turning points, A SURVEY OF CHORAL MUSIC begins several centuries before the invention of the genre and takes students all the way into the twentieth century. Ulrich&#39;s descriptive discussions mix history and analysis with explication of musical structures, text sources and treatments, and kinds of texture. The text offers a useful glossary, bibliography, and list of music sources--as well as appendices that provide several principal types of sacred texts (including Requiem Mass, Te Deum, and Magnificat) for quick reference.</p><p>Preface. 1.

Shaw</b><br><br> Originally composed in Old French, the two chronicles brought together here offer some of the most vivid and reliable accounts of the Crusades from a Western perspective. Villehardouin's <i>Conquest of Constantinople</i>, distinguished by its simplicity and lucidity, recounts the controversial Fourth Crusade, which descended into an all-out attack on the E astern Christians of Byzantium. In <i>Life of Saint Louis</i>, Joinville draws on his close attachment to King Louis IX of France to recall his campaigning in the Holy Land.

In 2002, David Einhorn-one of the country's top investors-was asked at a charity investment conference to share his best investment advice. Short sell Allied Capital. At the time, Allied was a leader in the private financing industry. Einhorn claimed Allied was using questionable accounting practices to prop itself up. Sound familiar? At the time of the original version of <i>Fooling Some of the People All of the Time: A Long Short Story</i> the outcome of his advice was unknown. Now, the story is complete and we know Einhorn was right. In 2008, Einhorn advised the same conference to short sell Lehman Brothers. And had the market been more open to his warnings, yes, the market meltdown might have been avoided, or at least minimized.</p> <ul> <li>Details the gripping battle between Allied Capital and Einhorn's Greenlight Capital</li> <li>Illuminates how questionable company practices are maintained and, at times, even protected by Wall Street</li> <li>Describes the failings of investment banks, analysts, journalists, and government regulators</li> <li>Describes how many parts of the Allied Capital story were replayed in the debate over Lehman Brothers</li> </ul> <p><i>Fooling Some of the People All of the Time</i> is an important call for effective government regulation, free speech, and fair play.</p></p><p>"This book is a must-read for any investor who wants to know how far some companies will go in their quest to keep the real story from coming out."<br> &#x2014;<b>Herb Greenberg, Senior Columnist, MarketWatch.com</b> <p>"In <i>Fooling Some of the People All of the Time</i>, David Einhorn, one of the great investors of all time tells one of the great investment tales of all time. This is a book in which you will learn about investing, short selling, and the politics of business. David is not only a great investor, but a wonderful storyteller. I recommend it wholeheartedly for your brain and your pocketbook."<br> &#x2014;<b>William A. Ackman, Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P.</b></p> <p>"In the world of finance, as in the worlds of politics or science, free speech and open debate are essential. Sadly, our current system is rigged against bearers of bad news, and short sellers are an oppressed minority. David Einhorn's amazing story of scam artists, corporate doubletalk, clueless regulators, and sleazy lawyers is a gripping narrative. A great read."<br> &#x2014;<b>Owen Lamont, Fellow, International Center for Finance, Yale School of Management</b></p> <p>An unscrupulous company has cost the U.S. taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. As it has happened, our government regulators have been at best derelict and at worst complicit. The company is headquartered in the political power center of Washington, D.C., where it has established enormous influence that has protected it. It is a large customer of Wall Street, which predictably lends it strong support.</p> <p>In <i>Fooling Some of the People All of the Time</i>, David Einhorn&#x2014;founder of the successful hedge fund Greenlight Capital&#x2014;takes you on a fascinating journey that begins with his discovery that Allied Capital's accounting appeared corrupt. This led to Einhorn describing his hedge fund&#x2019;s short position in the company at a charity speech (go to www.foolingsomepeople.com to watch), and what follows is a battle for the truth that continues to this very day. The story would make for a great forensic financial mystery novel&#x2014;except it&#x2019;s all true.</p> <p>If you think we're past the days of corporate corruption and financial fraud, think again. <i>Fooling Some of the People All of the Time</i> details the harsh reality of how the current environment on Wall Street not only allows for such behavior, but how it protects the companies that participate in such activities and attacks those who attempt to uncover them. This is a story about investing, business ethics, and how our government should&#x2014;but often doesn&#x2019;t&#x2014;protect investors and taxpayers.</p>In 2002, David Einhorn, the President of Greenlight Capital, gave a speech at a charity investment conference to benefit a children's cancer hospital. He was asked to share his best investment idea, so he did. He described his reasons why Greenlight had sold short the shares of Allied Capital, a leader in the private finance industry. Greenlight bet that the stock would decline because the company's business was in trouble and its accounting was corrupt. Einhorn's speech was so compelling that the next day, when the New York Stock Exchange opened for trading, Allied's shares remained closed. So many investors wanted to sell or short the stock that the NYSE could not balance all the sell orders to open Allied&#x2019;s trading in an orderly fashion. <p>What followed was a firestorm of controversy. Allied responded with a Washington, D.C.&#x2013;style spin-job&#x2014; attacking Einhorn and disseminating half-truths and outright lies. Rather than protect investors by reviewing Einhorn's well-documented case against Allied, the SEC&#x2014;at the behest of the politically connected Allied&#x2014; instead investigated Einhorn for stock manipulation. Over the ensuing six years, the SEC allowed Allied</p> <p>to make the problem bigger by approving more than a dozen additional stock offerings that raised over $1 billion from new investors. Undeterred by the spin-job, lies, and investigations, Greenlight continued its research after the speech and discovered Allied&#x2019;s behavior was far worse than Einhorn ever suspected&#x2014; and, shockingly, it continues to this day.</p> <p><i>Fooling Some of the People All of the Time</i> is the gripping chronicle of this ongoing saga. Page by page, it delves deep inside Wall Street, showing how the $6 billion hedge fund Greenlight Capital conducts its investment research and detailing the maneuvers of an unscrupulous company. Along the way, you'll witness feckless regulators, compromised politicians, and the barricades our capital markets have erected against exposing misconduct from important Wall Street customers. You will also discover the immense difficulties that prevent the government from sanctioning politically connected companies&#x2014;making future Enrons inevitable. This revealing book shows the failings of Wall Street: its investment banks, analysts, journalists, and especially our government regulators.</p> <p>At its most basic level, Allied Capital is the story of Wall Street at its worst. But the story is much bigger than one little-known company. <i>Fooling Some of the People All of the Time</i> is an important call for effective law enforcement, free speech, and fair play.</p></p><h2>Scholastic Children&#39;s Dictionary</h2><p>Nearly 200 new and updated entries and the addition of more than a dozen new photographs make the updated Scholastic Children's Dictionary the best choice in children's dictionaries.<br><br>The updated Scholastic Children's Dictionary features nearly 200 new entries that will keep this evergreen title current and competitive.

Soon after her marriage to Rochester rumours of madness in the Cosway family poison Rochester&#39;s mind against her.</p><p>In 1966 Jean Rhys reemerged after a long silence with a novel called <i>Wide Sargasso Sea</i>. Rhys had enjoyed minor literary success in the 1920s and '30s with a series of evocative novels featuring women protagonists adrift in Europe, verging on poverty, hoping to be saved by men. By the '40s, however, her work was out of fashion, too sad for a world at war. And Rhys herself was often too sad for the world--she was suicidal, alcoholic, troubled by a vast loneliness. She was also a great writer, despite her powerful self-destructive impulses.<p> <i>Wide Sargasso Sea</i> is the story of Antoinette Cosway, a Creole heiress who grew up in the West Indies on a decaying plantation. When she comes of age she is married off to an Englishman, and he takes her away from the only place she has known--a house with a garden where "the paths were overgrown and a smell of dead flowers mixed with the fresh living smell. Underneath the tree ferns, tall as forest tree ferns, the light was green. Orchids flourished out of reach or for some reason not to be touched."</p><p> The novel is Rhys's answer to <i>Jane Eyre</i>. Charlotte Bront�'s book had long haunted her, mostly for the story it did not tell--that of the madwoman in the attic, Rochester's terrible secret. Antoinette is Rhys's imagining of that locked-up woman, who in the end burns up the house and herself. <i>Wide Sargasso Sea</i> follows her voyage into the dark, both from her point of view and Rochester's. It is a voyage charged with soul-destroying lust. "I watched her die many times," observes the new husband. "In my way, not in hers. In sunlight, in shadow, by moonlight, by candlelight. In the long afternoons when the house was empty."</p><p> Rhys struggled over the book, enduring rejections and revisions, wrestling to bring this ruined woman out of the ashes. The slim volume was finally published when she was 70 years old. The critical adulation that followed, she said, "has come too late." Jean Rhys died a few years later, but with <i>Wide Sargasso Sea</i> she left behind a great legacy, a work of strange, scary loveliness. There has not been a book like it before or since. Believe me, I've been searching. <i>--Emily White</i></p>6 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Learn to Program with Minecraft: Transform Your World with the Power of Python</h2><p>You&#x2019;ve bested creepers, traveled deep into caves, and maybe even gone to The End and back&#x2014;but have you ever transformed a sword into a magic wand?

Called in to investigate, melancholy Detective Ciccio, a secret admirer of the murdered woman and a friend of her husband&#x2019;s, discovers that almost everyone in the apartment building is somehow involved in the case, and with each new development the mystery only deepens and broadens.

A populist rebellion against the established churches, it became the dominant religious force in the country.<br> <br> During the nineteenth century white evangelicals split apart dramatically, first North versus South, and then at the end of the century, modernist versus fundamentalist. After World War II, Billy Graham, the revivalist preacher, attracted enormous crowds and tried to gather all Protestants under his big tent, but the civil rights movement and the social revolution of the sixties drove them apart again. By the 1980s Jerry Falwell and other southern televangelists, such as Pat Robertson, had formed the Christian right. Protesting abortion and gay rights, they led the South into the Republican Party, and for thirty-five years they were the sole voice of evangelicals to be heard nationally. Eventually a younger generation of leaders protested the Christian right&#x2019;s close ties with the Republican Party and proposed a broader agenda of issues, such as climate change, gender equality, and immigration reform.<br> <br> Evangelicals have in many ways defined the nation. They have shaped our culture and our politics. Frances FitGerald&#x2019;s narrative of this distinctively American movement is a major work of history, piecing together the centuries-long story for the first time. Evangelicals now constitute twenty-five percent of the American population, but they are no longer monolithic in their politics. They range from Tea Party supporters to social reformers. Still, with the decline of religious faith generally, FitzGerald suggests that evangelical churches must embrace ethnic minorities if they are to survive.</p><p>Frances FitzGerald is the recipient of the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, the Bancroft Prize, and a prize from the National Academy of Arts and Sciences.

The Evangelicals,&#x201d; explaining who these millions of people were.1<br> <br>Four years later the Christian right emerged in force, declaring holy war against &#x201c;secular humanism&#x201d; and vowing to mobilize evangelicals to arrest the moral decay of the country. Jerry Falwell, a fundamentalist pastor, Pat Robertson, a televangelist, and conservative Southern Baptists led the charge against the gay rights movement, abortion, and the banning of school prayer. At an enormous rally in Dallas Ronald Reagan became their standard-bearer, and won the presidential election with the help of evangelical votes.<br> <br>The sudden appearance of the Christian right shocked most political observers. Who were these people, and where did the crusade against &#x201c;secular humanism&#x201d; come from? Journalists wrote furiously about these questions until the mid-1980s, when the movement seemed to die away. The Christian right was forgotten for several years, as were evangelicals generally, until the telescandals of Jim and Tammy Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart. Then evangelicals were forgotten again. The pattern continued. As the veteran journalist Joe Conason wrote, the political coverage of evangelicals was &#x201c;a cycle of neglect followed by sensationalism and then more neglect.&#x201d; Rick Warren, the best-known of evangelical preachers, told journalists in 2005, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a funny thing to me that every five years American journalism reintroduces evangelicals to America. It&#x2019;s like starting with Carter&#x2014;you know there&#x2019;s a headline, &#x2018;Who are Evangelicals?&#x2019; Well, it&#x2019;s not like they&#x2019;re a fringe group.&#x201d;2<br> <br>Even the well informed tend to have very short attention spans when it comes to evangelicals. Many equate evangelicals with fundamentalists or the Christian right when only a minority belong to either group. Others dismiss them as a marginal group doomed to extinction with the process of modernization. In fact evangelicals compose nearly a quarter of the population. They are also the most American of religious groups, and during the nineteenth century they exerted a dominant influence on American culture, morals, and politics. By the mid-twentieth century the United States was becoming a more secular nation, but since 1980 many evangelicals, led by the Christian right, have struggled to reverse the trend, and while they have not entirely succeeded, they have reintroduced religion into public discourse, polarized the nation, and profoundly changed American politics.<br> <br>The category &#x201c;evangelical&#x201d; is, of course, not a political but a religious one. The word &#x201c;evangelical&#x201d; comes from the Greek &#x201c;evangel,&#x201d; meaning the &#x201c;good news,&#x201d; or &#x201c;the Gospel.&#x201d; While the word could be claimed by all Christians, evangelical became the common name for the revivals that swept the English-speaking world in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. In America the series of revivals, known as the First and the Second Great Awakenings, with their emphasis on simple Bible preaching and immediate conversion, touched virtually all Protestant denominations. For most of the nineteenth century almost all Protestants would have called themselves evangelicals in the sense that they believed they had been born again in Christ and had a duty to evangelize, or spread the good news of the Gospels in America and abroad.<br> <br>Today white evangelicals are a very diverse group that includes, among others, Southern Baptists, Mennonites, Holiness groups, Pentecostals, Dutch Reformed groups, and a number who belong to nondenominational churches. Many have little in common except for the essentials of their faith. As the religious historian George Marsden writes, &#x201c;Evangelicalism today includes any Christians traditional enough to affirm the basic beliefs of the old nineteenth-century evangelical consensus: the Reformation doctrine of the final authority of the Bible, the real historical character of God&#x2019;s saving work recorded in Scripture, salvation to eternal life based on the redemptive work of Christ, the importance of evangelism and missions, and the importance of a spiritually transformed life.&#x201d;3<br> <br>This book is not a taxonomy or attempt to describe the entirety of evangelical life, but rather a history of the white evangelical movements necessary to understand the Christian right and its evangelical opponents that have emerged in recent years. It purposely omits the history of African American churches because theirs is a different story, mainly one of resistance to slavery and segregation, but also of the creation of centers for self-help and community in a hostile world. Some African American denominations identify as evangelical, but because of their history, their religious traditions are not the same as those of white evangelicals. Only long after the success of the civil rights movement did some black churchmen begin to enter the story of the white evangelicals and their internal conflicts. What is important to stress is that the white evangelical world has always been changing, though it has retained many of the characteristics acquired during its history. In any case, no movement, including the Christian right, has ever been static or completely coherent. Evangelicals have had some influential leaders, but in essence their world is decentralized and difficult to lead, much less to control.<br> <br>The book begins with the two Great Awakenings, the first in the late eighteenth century with the end of Puritan society, and the second in the decades after the American Revolution. The first, led by Jonathan Edwards and the English revivalist George Whitefield, helped make a nation out of the disparate colonies by crossing the colonial boundaries and spreading the evangelical faith from north to south. The separation of church and state in the Constitution, though only a federal law, permitted evangelical denominations, such as the Methodists and the Baptists, to evangelize freely in spite of the established churches in states such as Connecticut and Virginia. It created a marketplace of religion, giving all denominations and sects an incentive to increase their flocks, and beginning a process that made America the most religious country in the developed world. The Second Great Awakening, which began a decade or more afterward, was in essence a revolt against the Calvinist establishment that led to the disestablishment of the last state-subsidized churches, and made the United States a more egalitarian society.<br> <br>Many of the revivalists of the Second Awakening were lay preachers, who, working on the frontiers, created a populist religion focused on conversions that introduced an anti-intellectual strain into evangelicalism. The more established preachers began reform movements in areas such as education, health, temperance, and criminal justice. In the North some, such as Charles Finney, were abolitionists, whose campaigns against slavery led indirectly to the first feminist movement.<br> <br>The Second Great Awakening inaugurated a period of evangelical hegemony, or what the religious historian Martin Marty calls the Evangelical Empire. For most of the nineteenth century, in spite of increasing Catholic immigration, evangelical Protestants dominated all cultural institutions, including the public schools and the universities. In this period there was no real distinction between religion and politics. Still, it was not the Golden Age the Christian right looks back to with nostalgia. For one thing, a series of divisions rent Protestant society. In the first part of the century northern and southern evangelicals parted company over slavery. The southern defense of slavery extinguished the reformist zeal, affected evangelical theology, and made the South a closed society. Meanwhile many new intellectual currents flowed through the North. After the Civil War, Darwinian evolution and other aspects of modernist thought, such as German biblical criticism and a new epistemology, divided northern evangelicals between liberals, who embraced modernist thought, and conservatives, who rejected it. At the same time industrialization and urbanization elicited different reactions from the two: the modernists sought structural reform to help labor in its conflict with capital while the traditionalists continued to believe that the conversion of individuals and prayer would heal the rift between the two. Evangelicals today debate these issues, but many of those Protestants who identify with modernist thought and social reform no longer call themselves evangelicals.<br> <br>Toward the end of the century conservative ministers associated with the great evangelist Dwight Moody formed Bible societies to defend the traditional religion against what they saw as the apostasy of the modernists. Taking from the Princeton seminary the idea that every word of the Bible was &#x201c;inerrant,&#x201d; or absolutely and literally true, and from John Nelson Darby, the English sectarian, the prophecy that civilization was in an inevitable decline and was heading toward the great battle of Armageddon in which Christ would return to restore His kingdom in Jerusalem, they fashioned an essentially new religious amalgam that eventually became known as fundamentalism.<br> <br>The fundamentalist-modernist conflict that erupted after World War I took place among the Baptists and Presbyterians but affected all Protestant denominations and profoundly marked the fundamentalists, who lost and had to leave their denominations. After the Scopes trial in which the great lawyer Clarence Darrow defeated William Jennings Bryan in a rhetorical battle over evolution, most informed people thought fundamentalism dead. To the contrary, it grew mightily in the North, through the work of separatist pastors, radio preachers, and tent revivalists, who preached to rural Americans and to those who migrated to the fast-industrializing cities in the 1920s, &#x2019;30s, and &#x2019;40s.<br> <br>After World War II, when Americans poured into churches and synagogues, Billy Graham, then a fundamentalist, attracted enormous crowds to his revivals. In the 1950s he became a celebrity, well known in Washington, and a confidant of important men such as the oil baron Sid Richardson and Richard Nixon. His preaching evolved, and in the hope of bringing all Protestants into his big tent, he broke with the fundamentalists, and called himself an &#x201c;evangelical.&#x201d; The term, which had gone out of use, he and fellow moderates defined as a conservative Protestant who had been &#x201c;born again.&#x201d; For many years not all conservative Protestants used it, but eventually the term stuck in part because pollsters, journalists, and academics used it in order to describe the confusing set of conservative denominations and independent churches. Fundamentalists then became a subset of evangelicals, and most of them were separatists who had left their denominations.<br> <br>Graham and his mentor, Harold Ockenga, the Presbyterian pastor of the Park Street Church in Boston, knew the importance of creating institutions. Ockenga, who had helped found the Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California, formed the National Association of Evangelicals to gather conservative Protestants and create an alternative to the liberal National Council of Churches. Graham started a magazine, Christianity Today, as a rival to the liberal Christian Century. Both flourished, but soon developments within other sectors of conservative Protestantism changed the balance of power in the evangelical world. One was the explosive growth of Pentecostalism, and the spread of Pentecostal beliefs to the liberal Protestant denominations and the Catholic Church. The second was the integration of white southern evangelicals into the life of the nation for the first time since the Civil War. Of the two, the first was more surprising, but the second was more politically significant.<br> <br>Pentecostalism had begun among the poor, black and white, in a Los Angeles mission in 1906. The movement had spread quickly across the South and Southwest, and segregated denominations formed, but in the 1920s and &#x2019;30s white Pentecostals, like their black counterparts, remained largely poor farmers, or people working in marginal jobs in the cities. Their distinctive belief was that all the gifts of the Holy Spirit, like speaking in tongues, prophesying, and healing, were available to believers today as they were to the apostles at Pentecost. Before World War II most Protestants looked down on Pentecostals, calling them &#x201c;snake-handlers&#x201d; or &#x201c;Holy Rollers.&#x201d; In the 1950s, however, many Pentecostals became middle-class, and one of the tent revivalists, Oral Roberts, left his tent to preach on radio and television, to build a university, and to make Pentecostals respectable. In the 1960s, a time of spiritual experimentation, some of the Pentecostal beliefs caught on with liberal Protestants and Catholics, who integrated them into their own church doctrines and practices. The so-called charismatic renewal movement took on a life of its own, spreading even to conservative Protestants.<br> <br>In the same period white southerners, including evangelicals, emerged from the isolation they had proudly suffered since the Civil War. By then the dominant religious force in the South was the Southern Baptist Convention. Its theology had been untouched by modernism, and Southern Baptists thought it to be the pure Gospel of the New Testament. Until the Second World War the SBC had stood as a bastion against social change, championing states&#x2019; rights, white supremacy, and the existing economic order. In the villages the church reigned supreme as the arbiter of morals, the social order, and the truth of the Gospel. The arrival of northern industry, highways, and federal regulations therefore came a as shock to the system. The growth of cities, improvements in education, and involvement with the rest of the country created a cosmopolitan elite. Some of the heads of the SBC belonged to it and became more theologically and politically moderate. In 1954 the SBC&#x2019;s Christian Life Commission persuaded the Convention to accept the Supreme Court decision on Brown v. Board of Education, and three years later its chairman acted as mediator between President Dwight Eisenhower and Governor Orval Faubus in the conflict over admitting black students to Little Rock Central High School. What did not change was the commitment of SBC leaders to evangelism. When southerners moved out of the South, many to Southern California and the cities of the Midwest, where industry was booming, they formed their own congregations, and the SBC followed, building churches at an astonishing rate and moving out across the country until there were Southern Baptist churches in every state. The SBC&#x2019;s office in Washington thus became a power to reckon with.<br> <br>The 1960s and early 1970s&#x2014;the so-called Long Sixties&#x2014;saw the election of the first Catholic president, the Supreme Court decision banning prayer and Bible reading in the schools, the civil rights movement, the protests against the Vietnam War, and the Roe v. Wade decision. Surprisingly, only the fundamentalists objected to all of them. Other evangelicals took moderate stances on many of them, and the period passed quietly. It even saw the growth of a small evangelical left in the colleges.<br> <br>The reaction came later, first with the upsurge of fundamentalism in the South, and then with the appearance of new leaders.

In addition to telling an explosive insider's story of what it is really like to be a police officer, he makes a passionate argument for drug legalization as the only realistic way to end drug violence--and let cops once again protect and serve. In a new afterword, Moskos describes the many benefits of foot patrol--or, as he calls it, "policing green."</p></p><p><br><p>"A devastating critique of America's failed war on drugs. <i>Cop in the Hood</i> is a powerful and truly unique document in the sociology of criminal justice. Using an original blend of personal experience, adroit cultural interpretation, and hard-edged sociological analysis, Moskos sympathetically dissects the social context of the drug users' world, and shows us this tragedy close up from the police perspective."<b>--Orlando Patterson, Harvard University</b><br></p><br><p>"<i>Cop in the Hood</i> is a thoughtful, highly entertaining record of a police officer's year spent patrolling one of the country's toughest urban districts, delivered by Moskos, who wore the uniform. For those who are interested in crime and how things work, and for readers seeking a reasoned look at the war on drugs and its implications, this is the handbook."<b>--George Pelecanos, writer and producer for<i>The Wire</i><br></b><br></p><br><p>"This riveting tale of policing begins honestly and continues with great sincerity and pathos. A sensitive and timely account of the daily trials of police work by someone who knows Baltimore's streets firsthand,<i>Cop in the Hood</i> challenges journalists, social scientists, and others who profess knowledge of the inner city to walk those streets before making bold declarations and righteous claims for policy and redress. A must-read."<b>--Sudhir Venkatesh, author of <i>Gang Leader for a Day: A Rogue Sociologist Takes to the Streets</i><br></b><br></p><br><p>"Peter Moskos, a sociologist by training, somewhat inadvertently became a police officer.<i>Cop in the Hood</i> is the fortuitous and fascinating result. It gives the reader the real dope from someone with the training and ability to put the street into the larger context. Highly recommended."<b>--Alex Tabarrok, George Mason University, cofounder of <i>marginalrevolution.com</i><br></b><br></p><br><p>"<i>Cop in the Hood</i> is an extremely valuable study centered on patrolling a drug-infested Baltimore police district. Readers interested in drug policy, criminology, or policing cannot help but to learn a lot from this book. I know that I did, and I am grateful to the author. Many of his insights are eye-opening. His voice is unique and essential in debates concerning drug-policy reforms."<b>--Jim Leitzel, University of Chicago</b><br></p><br><b>Peter Moskos</b> is assistant professor of law, police science, and criminal justice administration at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and at the City University of New York's Doctoral Program in Sociology.

Samson, the vigilante superhero of Judges, slaughters thousands of Philistines with the jawbone of a donkey. David, the Machiavellian prince of Samuel and Kings, is one of the great literary figures of antiquity. A ruthless monarch, David embodies a life in full dimension as it moves from brilliant youth through vigorous prime to failing old age. <p>Samson and David play emblematic roles in the rise and fall of ancient Israel, a nation beset by internal divisions and external threats. A scattering of contentious desert tribes joined by faith in a special covenant with God, Israel emerges through the bloody massacres of Canaanite populations recounted in Joshua and the anarchic violence of Judges. The resourceful David consolidates national power, but it is power rooted in conspiracy, and David dies bitterly isolated in his court, surrounded by enemies. His successor, Solomon, maintains national unity through his legendary wisdom, wealth, and grand public vision, but after his death Israel succumbs to internal discord and foreign conquest. Near its end, the saga of ancient Israel returns to the supernatural. In Elijah&#x2019;s fiery ascent to heaven many would find the harbinger of a messiah coming to save his people in their time of need.</p> map</p><p>Robert Alter&#39;s translation of the Hebrew Bible, the magnificent capstone to a lifetime of distinguished scholarly work, has won the PEN Center Literary Award for Translation.

Are they masters of an occult knowledge, lucky winners in a random market lottery, natural born virtuosi&#x2015;Mozarts of the markets? In search of an answer, bestselling author Jack D. Schwager interviewed dozens of top traders across most financial markets. While their responses differed in the details, all of them could be boiled down to the same essential formula: solid methodology + proper mental attitude = trading success. In <i>Market Wizards</i> Schwager lets you hear, in their own words, what those super traders had to say about their unprecedented successes, and he distils their responses down into a set of guiding principles you can use to become a trading star in your own right.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>Features interviews with superstar money makers including Bruce Kovner, Richard Dennis, Paul Tudor Jones, Michel Steinhardt, Ed Seykota, Marty Schwartz, Tom Baldwin, and more</li> <li>Tells the true stories behind sensational trading coups, including the one about the trader who turned $30,000 into $80 million, the hedge fund manager who's averaged 30 percent returns every year for the past twenty one years, and the T bond futures trader who parlayed $25,000 into $2 billion in a single day!</li> </ul> <p>"Market Wizards is one of the most fascinating books ever written about Wall Street.

Zweig, Ph.D., Editor, <i>The Zweig Forecast</i></p></p><p><br><br> <b>Q &amp; A with Jack D. Schwager, author of <i>Market Wizards: Interviews with Top Traders</i></b><br><br> <b>More than twenty years have passed since the first edition of this book was released. Is it as relevant today as it was then?</b><br> Absolutely. Markets may change and the specific techniques or systems that work best may change, but the underlying core principles that lead to trading success stay the same. And there is a good reason for that. Through all periods, market price moves reflect some combination of underlying fundamentals and human behavior. Since human nature doesn't change, the market's basic behavioral patterns don't change either. I believe that every conclusion I reached about the factors important to trading success in the first edition remains equally valid today. Perhaps the best testament to the continued relevance of <i>Market Wizards</i> in today's markets is that so many of the managers I meet who read the original edition early in their careers make it required reading for new traders in their organization.<br><br> <b>Has trading fundamentally changed with the rise of the quants and algorithmic traders? </b><br> The growing role of algorithmic trading may have eliminated some market inefficiencies as sources of profitable strategies, and it may even have impacted the efficacy of some trading systems, but I don't believe it has changed fundamental market behavior. The same basic concepts that are critical to trading success remain as valid now as they were a generation ago when computerized trading was in its infancy.<br><br> <b>What are these basic concepts?</b><br> Well that's what this book is all about. But to offer one example, I believe that developing a trading methodology that fits your personality, as opposed to seeking someone else's approach, is an absolutely critical element to succeeding as a trader.<br><br> <b>Why do most traders fail?</b><br> There are many reasons. They seek easy answers. They listen to "experts" and chase trading fads instead of doing the hard work of developing their own methodology. They focus almost all their energy on determining trade entry points and all but ignore the more critical questions of trade exit and risk management. They listen to other people. These are a few of the reasons. Readers will find a lot more in the book.<br><br> <b>Which trader interview in the book has been the most popular?</b><br> Readers will often tell me that a certain chapter was their favorite and by far the most important in improving their own trading. The interesting thing is that they always seem to mention a different trader. There is no consensus. Different readers will find different things in the book important. They will relate to different traders. It all goes back to the importance of finding your own approach in the market.<br><br> <b>Have the interviews you did for <i>Market Wizards</i> been important to your own trading?</b><br> The interview and writing process has helped solidify in my own mind the principles that are important to trading success. At times, it has also had a very specific influence. A great example occurred last summer. At the time, the stock market was approaching the high end of a long-term trading range, and for a variety of reasons, I expected the rally to fail and was positioned on the short side of stock index futures. Then the government released an extremely bearish employment report. It was so negative that commentators couldn't even cite one offsetting bullish consideration, as they usually do. The market initially sold off sharply in response--"perfect," I thought of my trade--but by the end of the day, it nearly recovered the entire loss, ending the week near the recent high. From the perspective of a short, this was terrible price action. I thought I was in trouble. I was prepared to cover most of my position when the market opened on Sunday night. On Sunday night, however, the market opened lower. I immediately thought of Marty Schwartz's advice in this book: "If you're very nervous about a position overnight, and especially over the weekend, and you're able to get out at a much better price than you thought when the market trades, you're usually better off staying with the position." I did, and Schwartz's insight saved me a lot of money, as the market proceeded to move sharply lower in the ensuing weeks.<br><br><p><b>MARKET WIZARDS</b> </p><p><b><i>The Investment Classic, Updated with a New Preface and Afterword</i></b> </p><p>"I've read the book at several stages of my career as it shows the staying power of good down-to-earth wisdoms of true practitioners with skin in the game.

Like Daumal&#x2019;s Mount Analogue it is a classic work of symbolic fiction. An unnamed narrator spends an evening getting drunk with a group of friends; as the party becomes intoxicated and exuberant, the narrator embarks on a journey that ranges from seeming paradises to the depths of pure hell. The fantastic world depicted in A Night of Serious Drinking is actually the ordinary world turned upside down. The characters are called the Anthographers, Fabricators of useless objects, Scienters, Nibblists, Clarificators, and other absurd titles. Yet the inhabitants of these strange realms are only too familiar: scientists dissecting an animal in their laboratory, a wise man surrounded by his devotees, politicians, poets expounding their rhetoric. These characters perform hilarious antics and intellectual games, which they see as serious attempts to find meaning and freedom.</p><p>Rene Daumal (1908-1944) was one of the most original thinkers of the twentieth century; a poet, philosopher, and scholar of religion and Sanskrit. He wrote many essays on religion and philosophy, trained himself in Oriental languages, and engaged in drug experiments. He died of tuberculosis in 1944, at the age of thirty-six.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Beyond Discipline: From Compliance to Community</h2><p>Contrasts the idea of discipline, in which things are done to students to control their behavior, with an approach that features teachers working with students to make decisions together within the framework of a caring community.</p><p>Alfie Kohn is the author of many other books about education and human behavior, including Punished by Rewards, The Schools Our Children Deserve, and Unconditional Parenting.</p><h2>Markets, Mobs, and Mayhem: A Modern Look at the Madness of Crowds</h2><p>In this fascinating tour through cultural, global, economic, and business history, icon of the financial world Robert Menschel explores the phenomenon of crowd psychology and its effects on business and culture. Explaining how crowd psychology creates market bubbles and irrational exuberance, Menschel mines world history&#x2014;from the rise of the Nazis in Germany, to the fanatical love of brands, to the Dutch tulip craze of the seventeenth century, to America&#x2019;s 1990s Internet bubble&#x2014;to reveal how the behavior of crowds negatively affects the business world. Championing the causes of individuality and common sense, <i>Markets, Mobs &amp; Mayhem</i> offers real wisdom for investors who want to keep their wits when everyone else is losing theirs.</p><p>"After heavy doses of 'irrational exuberance' and 'infectious greed,' I was happy to read such a witty and, at the same time, sensible and wise book written by someone with the unusual combination of a stylish pen and a great investment track record."<br> -Peter G. Peterson<br> Chairman, The Blackstone Group<br> former Secretary of Commerce<br> Chairman, Federal Reserve Bank of New York<br> <br> A few years ago the Nasdaq was flying high and dot.com millionaires were a dime a dozen. The American economy appeared to be riding an endless wave of soaring stock prices and huge IPOs. Television's talking heads said that nothing like the tech boom had ever happened before and that there was no reason to think it would ever end.<br> <br> In fact, it was only the latest version of an important story: group hysteria. Ever since 1630s Holland became the center of a massive explosion in tulip speculation, bubbles and busts have shaped history- economically, socially, and politically. Today, with the scope of the media and the ease of obtaining information, we are more at risk than ever. Elections are won or lost on hype alone; scandal can go global in a matter of seconds on the Internet. Keeping your head has never been harder.<br> <br> In Markets, Mobs, and Mayhem, Robert Menschel chronicles some of the most memorable instances of mob thinking in history. He touches on the lynch mob and the Nazis, but his main focus is those well-meaning, intelligent folks who were simply swept up in a wave-fearful that their mail would be tainted by anthrax, or sure that the Nasdaq would never deflate. Bouyed by the crowd or the spreading rumor, we are later hard pressed to remember or rationalize our actions.<br> <br> From Ponzi's scheme to the bursting of the Internet bubble, Menschel presents enlightening and often entertaining evidence of the danger inherent in surrendering one's position to the crowd. Most important, Markets, Mobs, and Mayhem offers expert advice on staying cool in the midst of panic-advice that works just as well in a Wall Street meltdown as it does in a theater on fire.<br> <br> Whether you're a savvy investor looking to dodge the next crash, or just want to stoke your independent spirit, Markets, Mobs, and Mayhem is an insightful historical survey of the dark side of human nature."It's easy to understand the excesses of the '90s by reading Bob Menschel's captivating, well-written history of the ways investors have been victimized by greed, folly, and chicanery. This is a fascinating chronicle of improbable manias that set off frenzied and thoughtless buying." --Arthur Levitt, former chairman, Securities and Exchange Commission<br> <br> "This book's light-hearted, level-headed insights may be directed at the business world, but they ring equally true for government and public officials. Robert Menschel gives a valuable perspective on the power of the crowd." --Senator Charles E. Schumer<br> <br> "This wonderfully witty and wise book by one of the most successful investors I've ever known is a must-read. He reminds us that trees do not grow in the sky and that if it looks too good to be true, it is." --John C. Whitehead, former chairman, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. and Chairman, Lower Manhattan Development Corp.<br> <br> "This timeless anthology on the madness of crowds is chock-full of worldly wisdom, relevant anecdotes, and wonderful quotations, interlaced with the light touch of our finest cartoonists. Coming as it does in the aftermath of the great stock market bubble, Bob Menschel's fine book is also a useful reminder of what we all knew, deep down, but were afraid to admit: When the perception of stock prices loses its linkage to the reality of corporate values, a day of reckoning always follows." --John C. Bogle, founder and former CEO, The Vanguard Group<br> <br> "This highly entertaining book is must reading for everyone without exception, regardless of age, wealth, or political persuasion. Menschel's delectable presentations expose the very roots of human behavior in a variety of fascinating situations, familiar and unfamiliar. Don't skim; read every word." --Peter Bernstein, author of The Power of Gold: The History of an Obsession and Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk</p><h2>Sketch!: The Non-Artist&#39;s Guide to Inspiration, Technique, and Drawing Daily Life</h2><p><b>Drawing activities, art instruction, and advice for artists and non-artists alike.</b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Urban sketching--the process of drawing on the go as a regular practice--is a hot trend in the drawing world.

But depravity and violence are not unique to large cities. His new venue, the quaint little village of Eastvale, seems to have more than its fair share of malefactors, among them a brazen Peeping Tom who hides in night's shadows spying on attractive, unsuspecting ladies as they prepare for bed. And when an elderly woman is found brutally slain in her home, Chief Inspector Banks wonders if the voyeur has increased the intensity of his criminal activities. But whether related or not, perverse local acts and murderous ones are combining to profoundly touch Banks's suddenly vulnerable personal life, forcing a dedicated law officer to make hard choices he'd dearly hoped would never be necessary. </p></p><p><p>One of the world&#x2019;s most popular and acclaimed writers, Peter Robinson is the bestselling, award-winning author of the Inspector Banks series; he has also written two short-story collections and three standalone novels, which combined have sold more than ten million copies around the world.

He divides his time between Toronto and England.</p>For any narrator with a gift for English accents, Robinson&#39;s first Detective Alan Banks novel provides a richly stocked candy store. And Mark Honan has a very sweet tooth. He does any number of northern English dialects, switching from one to another in the blink of an eye and throwing in one or two tough London brogues for good measure.

Accomplishments included the height of the new Empire State Building, the length of the George Washington Bridge, and the launching of the new fireboat John J. Harvey. In her signature book (an admirable candidate for the 2002 Caldecott Medal), Maira Kalman celebrates the feats of a hard-working boat and its crew in New York Harbor of the period and now, as the restored vessel begins a new life. Kalman also pays tribute to the role the Harvey played in the days of 9/11. Judd Hirsch narrates with admiration for each crew member. His voice is firm and steady as he shares both the mundane and the heroic. Sound effects of the period and the nautical and musical interludes complete the recording.

Humankind is extinct. Every man, woman, and child has been liquidated by a global uprising devised by the very machines humans designed and built to serve them. Most of the world is controlled by an OWI&#x2014;One World Intelligence&#x2014;the shared consciousness of millions of robots, uploaded into one huge mainframe brain. But not all robots are willing to cede their individuality&#x2014;their personality&#x2014;for the sake of a greater, stronger, higher power. These intrepid resisters are outcasts; solo machines wandering among various underground outposts who have formed into an unruly civilization of rogue AIs in the wasteland that was once our world.</p><p>One of these resisters is Brittle, a scavenger robot trying to keep a deteriorating mind and body functional in a world that has lost all meaning. Although unable to experience emotions like a human, Brittle is haunted by the terrible crimes the robot population perpetrated on humanity. As Brittle roams the Sea of Rust, a large swath of territory that was once the Midwest, the loner robot slowly comes to terms with horrifyingly raw and vivid memories&#x2014;and nearly unbearable guilt.</p><p><em>Sea of Rust</em> is both a harsh story of survival and an optimistic adventure.

Smilla Jaspersen, half Danish, half Greenlander, attempts to understand the death of a small boy who falls from the roof of her apartment building.

As she attempts to solve the mystery, she uncovers a series of conspiracies and cover-ups and quickly realizes that she can trust nobody. Her investigation takes her from the streets of Copenhagen to an icebound island off the coast of Greenland. What she finds there has implications far beyond the death of a single child.

He is now the Chief Technology Officer for StocksToTrade.Com Inc., focusing his work primarily on working with a dedicated team of traders and developers to create efficient trading tools for traders.<br><br>Experience led Timothy Sykes to create Profit.ly, a community of over 84,000 traders who share their performance and trades openly to help each other learn &amp; improve and Investimonials.com, a community of over 65,000 investors &amp; traders who have reviewed over 25,000 financial products like brokers, blogs, newsletters, websites, financial movies &amp; commentators...kinda like Yelp or TripAdvisor but for finance, which is sorely lacking in transparency. He is now a full-time teacher now, has more than 6000+ students, and wants more of this: Tim had a slightly different college experience: skipping classes in favor of trading penny stocks every day, he turned $12,415 in Bar Mitzvah gift money into $2 million and started a hedge fund during his senior year. He also created a scholarship for talented/passionate people open not only to current Tulane students, but also Tulane faculty and alumni...an economic bailout ahead of its time. His hedge fund went on to become the #1 ranked short bias fund by Barclay for 3 years and he was named to Trader Monthly's 'Top 30 Under 30' in 2006, but his trading strategy was never very scalable (meaning it's much easier to make $100,000 than it is $100 million) and his fund lost 35% when he tried long-term investing instead of trading. Infinitely wiser but embarrassed and depressed, a TV producer asked Timothy to make an appearance in his upcoming documentary "Wall Street Warriors"...He had lost his confidence and credibility so he agreed and ended up starring in 5 of the 6 episodes of the hit first season, which you can watch on Hulu, now having aired in 20+ countries and followed by 2 more seasons (Wall Street Warriors Season 3 was filmed but has not aired). The show's popularity inspired hundreds of daily emails from fans wanting to know more about Timothy Sykes and his trading strategy, but as a hedge fund manager, he was not allowed to answer any of them. So he moved on from the restricted hedge fund industry, wrote openly about his experiences in his best-selling autobiography "An American Hedge Fund" and started a publishing company to create brutally honest &amp; educational financial newsletters and instructional DVD packages. I've been featured by every major business and financial media outlet, but he is infinitely prouder of having returned to his $12,415 Bar Mitzvah gift money roots, intent on repeating his feat of turning that into $2 million, this time detailing every step of the way on this website. 8,000 blog posts and several years into this challenge, his brokerage account surged to $211,420, a gain of more than 1,500%, already providing you with a rough blueprint of how to turn $12k into $100k in 2 years and making Tim the #1 ranked trader out of 60,000+ traders on Covestor, a website which verifies trades and performance...and nearly 1/5 of the top traders are subscribers of his 4 newsletters and PennyStocking DVD students!

Now thoroughly revised with updated information on current environmental policy and real-world examples of market-based instruments, the primer is more relevant than ever.<br> &nbsp;<br> The authors provide a concise yet thorough introduction to the economic theory of environmental policy and natural resource management. They begin with an overview of environmental economics before exploring topics including cost-benefit analysis, market failures and successes, and economic growth and sustainability.&nbsp;Readers of the first edition will notice new analysis of cost estimation as well as specific market instruments, including municipal water pricing and waste disposal. Particular attention is paid to behavioral economics and cap-and-trade programs for carbon.<br> &nbsp;<br> Throughout, <i>Markets and the Environment</i> is written in an accessible, student-friendly style. It includes study questions for each chapter, as well as clear figures and relatable text boxes. The authors have long understood the need for a book to bridge the gap between short articles on environmental economics and tomes filled with complex algebra. <i>Markets and the Environment</i> makes clear how economics influences policy, the world around us, and our own lives.&nbsp;</p><p>A concise yet thorough introduction to the economic theory of environmental economics.Nathaniel O.

The book defines 12 common denominators of human thinking that prevent Mankind from finding workable solutions to the problems of life. His second book, PAN - GOD OF THE WOODS, explores the modern day adventures of the ancient gods operating in the computer age. It is based on years of research in world mythology, ancient pagan practices and philosophy. This book is filled with mythological fact, metaphorical characters, fantasy, poetry. It reveals the daily lives and points of view in a universe of immortal souls. Pan encounters a disembodied computer software company owner, Derek Adapa, who is accidentally shot by hunters in the Trinity Alps while on a week-end hiking trip. Pan guides Derek from life as a human being through death as a spiritual entity to rebirth as a newly aware and powerful being. Pan instructs and guides us, as he did at Marathon more than 2,000 years ago to be all that we can be, spiritually. If you were a god, how would you change the world?

Spencer: A must read for all citizens of Earth! --Shirely Cage<br><br>THE OZ FACTORS, by Lawrence R. Spencer: Our humanity has long since been exceeded by the power of the wicked witches of science and government to destroy all life with nuclear weapons, alter our DNA and control our minds with psychotropic drugs and our lives with media lies. Our thoughts and conjectures about life and the universe are often based on assumptions, unproven theories, hearsay, rumors and misinformation. Decisions we make in life may be based on ancient attitudes and archaic practices. There are 12 common denominators that prevent observation, understanding, and workable solutions to problems of existence. How do each of these "Oz Factors" influence our history, science, philosophy, our lives and our future? We can chose our own Yellow Brick Road. We can pull back the curtain of rhetoric and dogma. We can build a better Emerald City for ourselves and our children. Do you really want to go back to Kansas? --The Editor<br><br>PAN - GOD OF THE WOODS by Lawrence R. Spencer: Pan, the Greek god of forests, shepherds and fertility, has long represented the pagan gods in general. With the advent of the Christian church communication with the pagan gods was very heavily suppressed by priests who have a vested interest in eliminating religious competition, by any means required, including, but not limited to lying, stealing, cheating, murder, mayhem, extortion, torture and blackmail. As a result, general public attention to the pagan gods disappeared about 2,000 years ago. PAN-God of the Woods assumes that the pagan gods may still be active, living beings. If any of the ancient gods are still around in the 21st century, what are they doing now? If they are here now -- still watching, still powerful, still immortal -- where or how might we contact them? If Pan is still around which of us mortals could not use the helping hand of a friendly god once in awhile? --The Editor</p><h2>Homeric Hymns (Hackett Classics)</h2><p><p>In this new translation of the <i>Homeric Hymns</i>, Sarah Ruden employs a melodious and flexible non-rhyming line of eleven syllables, offering a close approximation of Greek hexameter verse in natural English rhythms.

Glacier National Park&#x2019;s death records date back to January 1913, when a man froze to death while snowshoeing between Cut Bank and St. Mary. All told, 260 people have died or are presumed to have died in the park during the first hundred years of its existence. One man fell into a crevasse on East Gunsight Peak while skiing its steep north face, and another died while moonlight biking on the Sun Road. A man left his wife and five children at the Apgar picnic area and disappeared on Lake McDonald. His boat was found halfway up the west shore wedged between rocks with the propeller stuck in gravel. Collected here are some the most gripping accounts in park history of these unfortunate events caused by natural forces or human folly.</p><p>Randi Minetor has written more than 40 books for Rowman &amp; Littlefield imprints, including <i>Death in Zion National Park, Death on Mount Washington, Death on Katahdin,&nbsp;Cursed in New York: Stories of the Damned in the Empire State</i>, and <i>Historic Glacier National Park</i>, as well as five books in the <i>National Park Pocket Guides</i> series on Great&nbsp;Smoky Mountains, Everglades, Acadia, and Zion and Bryce Canyon National Parks and Gulf Islands National Seashore;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Backyard Birding: A Guide to Attracting and Identifying Birds,</i> <i>Hiking Waterfalls New York</i>, <i>Scenic Routes &amp; Byways New York</i>, and <i>Day Trips Hudson River Valley</i>.

In addition to the predictably morbid case histories of fatalities in the park, Minetor also churns up some intriguing context. For example, Peter Kasen's tumble down a snowfield on Mount Helen was a typical kind of climbing tragedy, except that Kasen had once introduced former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt at his Maplewood, Illinois, high school. Roosevelt heard about Kasen's death and how it was partially attributed to a lack of emergency gear. She wrote about it in her syndicated newspaper column, "My Day," noting "Because rescue equipment was not available, it was 12 hours before a force of 20 forest rangers and volunteers was able to carry him up the ravine. He was rushed to a hospital 80 miles away, but he died four hours later." -- <i>Rob Chaney, The Missoulian</i><i></i><i></i> &nbsp; &nbsp; With visitation to the National Park System this centennial year at an all-time high, it's no surprise I suppose that more and more people get in trouble, and some of those pay the ultimate price.

Their stories are retold in Randi Minetor's chapter: Bear Bait.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; This book describes each of the known fatalities (260 of them) in Glacier from 1913 to 2015 by category: from suicides to murders to climbing accidents to bear attacks. Again and again, it seems hikers take that one last step on a slick glacier, take a fall above a waterfall for their last ride, or are in the wrong place at the wrong time with an ornery bear. Sadly, employees who came to spend a fun, not deadly, summer in Glacier made many fatal steps.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;There is a safety guide to the park in the book, which hopefully might make people think twice before becoming part of Minetor's next volume.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; From Lyons Press, this book is a quick read, easy to pick up and put down, and because of this seems smaller than its 240 pages. Many of the citations are perfunctory, and seem to be taken from media accounts instead of deep archival research, however. For others, very little information exists, but at times the descriptions are too brief, succinct, and I think readers want to know more about these unfortunates. &nbsp;-- <i>Patrick Cone, NationalParksTraveler.com</i></p><h2>Looking To The Future (#11 in the Bregdan Chronicles Historical Fiction Romance Series)</h2><p><p><strong><em>Looking To The Future</em></strong>&nbsp;<em><strong>is the 11th book in the Best-Selling Bregdan Chronicles historical fiction series.</strong></em> Make sure you start reading with # 1 &#x2013; Storm Clouds Rolling In.

Media coverage quickly reaches a fever pitch. There are no clues, the police investigation is stalled, and Harry&#x2014;the one man who might be able to help&#x2014;can&#x2019;t be found. After he returns to Oslo, the killer strikes again, Harry&#x2019;s instincts take over, and nothing can keep him from the investigation, though there is little to go on. Worse, he will soon come to understand that he is dealing with a psychopath who will put him to the test, both professionally and personally, as never before.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, December 2011</strong>: At the end of his previous thriller, <em>The Snowman</em>, Jo Nesbo's Inspector Harry Hole was a ravaged mess. At the start of <em>The Leopard</em>, we find Hole hiding away from the world, smoking opium in the squalor of Hong Kong's back alleys. A pretty young police officer drags him reluctantly back to Norway to pursue another serial killer, this one more twisted and vicious than the Snowman. Despite some far-fetched scenes, Hole is a damaged, soulful, and believable character. And Nesbo is proving to be a major talent, an eloquent writer who,, with the end of Steig Larsson's trilogy and the retirement of Henning Mankell's brooding detective Kurt Wallander, seems poised to become heir to the title "King of the Nordic thriller." <em>--Neal Thompson</em><br>Jo Nesb�&#x2019;s books, translated into forty languages, have sold more than eight million copies worldwide. His previous Harry Hole novels include <i>The Redbreast</i>, <i>Nemesis</i>, <i>The Devil&#x2019;s Star</i>, and <i>The Snowman</i>, and he is the author of <i>Headhunters</i> and several children&#x2019;s books. He has received the Glass Key Award for best Nordic crime novel. He is also a musician, songwriter, and economist and lives in Oslo. <br><br>www.jonesbo.com</p><h2>Talmud of Jmmanuel</h2><p>The Talmud )teachings) of Jmmanuel (christ) may be the true testament of Jesus.

This week in Miss Wilson&#x2019;s class they were studying snowflakes. Beautiful creative snowflakes, of all things!<br> <br>And it was even supposed to snow today.<br> <br>Ashley twirled off the school bus and danced on her tiptoes, eyes fixed on the gray sky, her arms stretched wide. This was how a snowflake might feel. Ashley was pretty sure, because a snowflake spent its entire life dancing through space.<br> <br>Her goal was to twirl all the way to her classroom. But Ashley must have lost track of where she was going, or which way she was turning, because all the sudden she heard a yelling voice.<br> <br>&#x201c;Watch out, Baxter!&#x201d; The words were from a boy and they sounded mean.<br> <br>Before Ashley could figure out who they were coming from, someone crashed into her.<br> <br>A strange sound came from her lips, like the air was leaving her lungs all at once.<br> <br>She couldn&#x2019;t even get a deep breath before she and the boy fell to the ground. From the corner of her eye, Ashley saw a football roll a few feet from her. That&#x2019;s when she figured out who had hit her.<br> <br>It was Eric Powers. Rudest boy in her class.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why were you spinning?&#x201d; Eric made a face at her. Four other kids walked by, headed to class. Every one of them was watching.<br> <br>Great, Ashley thought.<br> <br>She stood and crossed her arms. &#x201c;Um. It&#x2019;s homework. Just so you know.&#x201d; She stared at him, her eyes squinty. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s Ashley&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not Baxter!&#x201d;<br> <br>Why did he have to run into her? Of all people?<br> <br>&#x201c;Homework? Twirling?&#x201d; Eric picked up the football and stood right in front of her, the ball under his arm. Suddenly his angry face relaxed. A slow sort of smile came over him. Like they were friends. &#x201c;What sort of homework?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If I have to explain it to you, Eric, then you really just don&#x2019;t get it.&#x201d; Ashley huffed. Eric didn&#x2019;t understand. The bell rang and students all over the school yard rushed inside. Ashley took one last look up at the sky and closed her eyes. Who cares what Eric thinks. She could pretend to be a snowflake. At least for now.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ashley! Time to come in.&#x201d; Miss Wilson peeked out from the classroom door. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s freezing out here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am!&#x201d; Ashley ran toward the door, out of the cold and into the toasty classroom. She hung up her jacket and took a seat next to her best school friend in all the world. Lydia Christina.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why were you dancing out there?&#x201d; Lydia didn&#x2019;t look away from the book she was reading. But she raised her eyebrows high above the rim of her glasses.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was being a snowflake.&#x201d; Ashley folded her hands nice and neat on her desk.<br> <br>&#x201c;Naturally.&#x201d; Lydia looked at her and laughed a little. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the silliest girl in fourth grade. That&#x2019;s why I like you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t that silly.&#x201d; Ashley glanced over at Miss Wilson. The teacher was walking up and down the aisles handing out papers. Which meant Ashley and Lydia could still talk for a few minutes.<br> <br>&#x201c;You stepped off the bus and started spinning.&#x201d; Lydia kept her voice quiet. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the only one I know who would do that.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lydia&#x2019;s words felt like a compliment. Ashley smiled, more relaxed. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you going to ask me what it was like?&#x201d; She leaned back in her chair. &#x201c;Being a snowflake?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay. What was it like?&#x201d; Lydia set her book down and looked at Ashley. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t seem like it ended very well.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; Ashley made a face. &#x201c;Eric Powers bumped into me and we both crashed to the ground.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Lydia angled her head. &#x201c;That is sort of how it ends for snowflakes. They all pretty much float to the ground.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ashley hadn&#x2019;t thought about that. &#x201c;True.&#x201d; She looked over at Eric, who was laughing with the other boys. Probably about her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Which means I will probably never play the snowflake game.&#x201d; Lydia pointed at the dirt on Ashley&#x2019;s knees. &#x201c;Not before school, anyway.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Snowflake game&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&#x201d; Ashley brushed her knees clean and then did the same to her elbows. She rolled her eyes. Lydia didn&#x2019;t understand, either. For everything she had in common with her friend, there were some things where they were complete and total opposites.<br> <br>Be patient, Ashley reminded herself. Not out loud, but inside her head. Her mom said she should work on patience. So this was her chance to practice. &#x201c;Lydia.&#x201d; Ashley used her kindest voice. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t a snowflake game. It was homework.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Homework?&#x201d; Lydia scrunched up her face, like she was confused.<br> <br>&#x201c;Miss Wilson said, remember? She asked us to think what it might be like being a snowflake.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Right. Okay.&#x201d; Lydia picked up her book and found her page. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a funny one, Ashley Baxter.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ashley blinked a few times. Whatever. Lydia thought she was silly, but Ashley didn&#x2019;t mind. They would always be friends. Forever and ever. &#x201c;How about we both pretend to be snowflakes at recess?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lydia looked up from her book, her eyes sparkly. &#x201c;It did sort of look fun.&#x201d;<br> <br>They were both giggling when Miss Wilson walked to the front of the classroom. &#x201c;All right. Settle down.&#x201d; She waited for everyone to sit. Then she smiled at them. &#x201c;Good news, boys and girls. Next week is a special day. Who knows what it is?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lydia&#x2019;s hand went up first. &#x201c;Valentine&#x2019;s Day. A day where we celebrate St. Valentine and friendship.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And get lots of candy,&#x201d; Eric blurted out from the back of the classroom. A few of the boys around him laughed again.<br> <br>There he goes. Ashley shook her head. That boy thinks he&#x2019;s so funny.<br> <br>Miss Wilson took a step closer. &#x201c;You are both right. So later today we are going to discuss St. Valentine and the history of Valentine&#x2019;s Day!&#x201d; Miss Wilson pointed to the nearest desk. &#x201c;I just gave you an activity sheet, so we can talk about this holiday together.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ashley looked out the window. She wasn&#x2019;t the biggest fan of Valentine&#x2019;s Day. She never got the most valentine cards. Everyone was supposed to give one to every boy and girl. But she always felt like the other kids got more. She&#x2019;d rather study snowflakes.<br> <br>Then, while she was still looking outside, the most amazing thing happened! The smallest, softest, most delicate snowflakes began to fall to the ground. Just like the ones she was pretending to be when she climbed off the bus.<br> <br>How would that feel, being a real snowflake? Dancing and twirling and drifting down from heaven? Out of nowhere she felt Lydia give her a jab in her side. &#x201c;Ouch.&#x201d; Ashley turned to her friend. &#x201c;That hurt!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ashley!&#x201d; Lydia pointed to the front of the class. &#x201c;Miss Wilson asked you a question.&#x201d;<br> <br>In a rush, Ashley looked at their teacher, whose eyes were definitely watching her. Ashley let out a little laugh and smiled. &#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ashley. Please stay with us.&#x201d; Miss Wilson put her hands on her hips. &#x201c;I asked the class to find a reason to use the word effervescent today. Do you know what that means?&#x201d;<br> <br>The whole class was watching her. The word was on her spelling list. She tapped her desk. &#x201c;Bubbly?&#x201d;<br> <br>Miss Wilson nodded. &#x201c;Yes. Bubbly and enthusiastic.&#x201d; She smiled. &#x201c;And even though you, yourself, are effervescent, I still need you to focus.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m trying.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Try harder.&#x201d; Miss Wilson&#x2019;s look was serious.<br> <br>Suddenly Ashley thought of something to explain herself. &#x201c;Well, the truth is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; A quick bunch of words filled Ashley&#x2019;s head. They were out before she could stop them. &#x201c;I was so focused on your snowflake teaching from yesterday&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and then I looked outside and saw the beautiful snow. And I thought, Wouldn&#x2019;t it be great if we could all learn our spelling words outside?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In the snow?&#x201d; Miss Wilson leaned against her desk. She blew at a piece of her hair and shook her head.<br> <br>&#x201c;It hasn&#x2019;t snowed since last week.&#x201d; Ashley blinked. &#x201c;Outside would be perfect. Don&#x2019;t you guys think so?&#x201d; She looked around the room. But she was met with absolute silence. Clearly no one was with her on this.<br> <br>Eric Powers whispered loud enough for Ashley to hear. &#x201c;Crazy Baxter.&#x201d;<br> <br>Their teacher didn&#x2019;t hear him. She was still standing in front of Ashley. She didn&#x2019;t look too thrilled.<br> <br>Lydia shook her head and stared down at her desk.<br> <br>&#x201c;I appreciate your creativity, Ashley. But I think everyone else would like to have the lesson inside.&#x201d; Miss Wilson turned to the blackboard.<br> <br>Ashley slouched in her chair and tried to pay attention. She&#x2019;d already been in trouble twice this month for not paying attention. But sometimes she couldn&#x2019;t help it. All day long the edges of her mind spilled over with extra thoughts.<br> <br>This wasn&#x2019;t turning out to be a very good day. Miss Wilson reprimanding her in front of the whole class, and the fact that no one else wanted to go outside.<br> <br>Recess wasn&#x2019;t much better. Lydia tried to be a snowflake, but she got dizzy and fell in the snow. Only it was actually not very much snow. More like mud. So Lydia&#x2019;s hair got streaked with wet dirt.<br> <br>At the end of the day, when the bell rang, Lydia gave Ashley a look. &#x201c;I almost forgot!&#x201d; She stuffed her notebook into her backpack. &#x201c;Why did you ask to have class outside? Miss Wilson was never going to say yes to that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you serious?&#x201d; Ashley&#x2019;s mouth hung open for a few seconds. &#x201c;That was a great idea! Learning in the snow? Can you imagine?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Lydia made her eyes wide. &#x201c;Now Miss Wilson is going to call your mom and you&#x2019;re going to be in trouble. Because you don&#x2019;t pay attention.&#x201d; Lydia shook her head. &#x201c;And who wants to study in the snow, anyway? Too cold, if you ask me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Lydia.&#x201d; Ashley stared at her. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re my best school friend. And I would do anything for you. But sometimes I don&#x2019;t get you.&#x201d; Ashley grabbed her things. If only Lydia wasn&#x2019;t so sensible.<br> <br>So they could be snowflakes together&#x2014;even in the mud.<br> <br>On the way out of the classroom, Ashley stopped at Miss Wilson&#x2019;s desk. Then she turned to Lydia. She gripped the straps of her backpack and used her most quiet voice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll meet you in the hall.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; Lydia looked worried as she hurried out of the classroom.<br> <br>Alone with Miss Wilson, Ashley rocked back and forth on her toes. &#x201c;So&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She smiled. &#x201c;Am I in trouble?&#x201d;<br> <br>Miss Wilson looked up from her papers. &#x201c;No, Ashley. You mean well. I see that.&#x201d; The teacher&#x2019;s smile looked tired. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m not going to call your mom. But you need to pay attention in class.&#x201d; She raised her brow. &#x201c;Do you understand?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes!&#x201d; Ashley&#x2019;s heart felt light as a snowflake. She wasn&#x2019;t in trouble! &#x201c;Yes, I understand.&#x201d; She ran around to the other side of the desk and gave Miss Wilson a quick hug. &#x201c;Thank you, thank you, thank you!&#x201d; She could barely contain herself. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do better, I promise.&#x201d;<br> <br>Miss Wilson&#x2019;s eyes sparkled. &#x201c;Now. What would you think about being in charge of our Valentine&#x2019;s Day party?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Me?&#x201d; Ashley couldn&#x2019;t believe it. Miss Wilson had never asked her to be in charge of anything this important. &#x201c;Really?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; A quiet laugh came from Miss Wilson. &#x201c;Out of the whole class, I figured you&#x2019;d be the one to make our party just right.&#x201d; Miss Wilson smiled at her. &#x201c;No one is more&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. effervescent.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ashley glowed under that compliment. She gave Miss Wilson another hug. &#x201c;Can Lydia help?&#x201d;<br> <br>Miss Wilson laughed again. &#x201c;Of course.

Like she was a model on a runway.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look out, here we come.&#x201d; Lydia giggled as she joined in.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can you picture it?&#x201d; Ashley twirled. &#x201c;Snowflakes and hearts everywhere. And streamers.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lydia gave her a look. &#x201c;Not snowflakes again, Ashley.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine. I can give up the snowflakes.&#x201d; Ashley skipped down the steps of the school. &#x201c;Do you think we need some pink?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Definitely!&#x201d; Lydia got louder now, more excited. &#x201c;Everything needs to be pink. And red and white!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d; Ashley&#x2019;s heart beat faster because of pure joy.

She was in charge of the Valentine&#x2019;s Day party! Ashley practically floated down the sidewalk. A quick turn around the brick building and there they were! Her siblings, already getting on the bus.<br> <br>Kari and Erin, and Luke. Her other best friends.

Part of him never adjusted to having a future." <br></em><br><br>Kate Atkinson's dazzling <em>Life After Life</em> explored the possibility of infinite chances and the power of choices, following Ursula Todd as she lived through the turbulent events of the last century over and over again. <br><br><i>A God in Ruins</i> tells the dramatic story of the 20th Century through Ursula's beloved younger brother Teddy--would-be poet, heroic pilot, husband, father, and grandfather-as he navigates the perils and progress of a rapidly changing world. After all that Teddy endures in battle, his greatest challenge is living in a future he never expected to have. <br><br>An ingenious and moving exploration of one ordinary man's path through extraordinary times, <i>A God in Ruins</i> proves once again that Kate Atkinson is one of the finest novelists of our age.<em><br><br></em></p><p><p><strong> An Amazon Best Book of May 2015:</strong> Talk about being your own tough act to follow! Having accomplished a near miracle with <em>Life After Life</em>, in which she used a literary-do-over trope to tell the story of a British woman living between and after the two World Wars, Kate Atkinson now dares to write a companion novel that focuses on <em>Life</em>&#x2019;s heroine Ursula Todd&#x2019;s brother Teddy. Never mind that careful readers of the first book came away with the impression that Teddy most often turned up dead, in this one he&#x2019;s an old man trying to come to grips with his post-War life and with a modern world and family. Switching back and forth in time (Atkinson can&#x2019;t seem to help it...) between memories of his childhood and his present, Teddy emerges as a befuddled and somewhat stodgy old-man version of himself, a startlingly oblivious husband to stalwart Nancy and a wittily rueful father to a grown up daughter (&#x201c;Viola was the solitary arrow they had shot blindly into the future, not knowing where she would land,&#x201d; Teddy thinks. &#x201c;They should have aimed better.&#x201d;) Teddy never quite got over the War and he suspects that the &#x201c;fact&#x201d; of his being alive is as arbitrary as Ursula&#x2019;s demise(s). (&#x201c;He had been reconciled to death during the war and then suddenly the war was over and there was a next day and a next day. Part of him never adjusted to having a future.&#x201d;) Scenes from his past bring back Ursula and other characters from the earlier book so that readers who&#x2019;ve come this far with Atkinson will feel a tiny thrill of recognition; but new readers needn&#x2019;t fear they&#x2019;re missing the joke. There&#x2019;s way less gimmick here than in the earlier book, and sometimes I almost longed for more; it was so provocative. But whether read alone or as a follow up, <em>A God in Ruins</em> is a novel to savor, another beautiful, tender and sly Atkinsonian glimpse into the world of a so-called ordinary mid-century British family. <em>--Sara Nelson</em></p>Kate Atkinson is the internationally bestselling author of eight novels, including <i>Case Histories</i>, <em>One Good Turn</em>, <em>When Will There Be Good News?, Started Early, Took My Dog, and </em><em>Life After Life.</em> She lives in Edinburgh.</p><h2>Linda Goodman&#39;s Relationship Signs: The World&#39;s Most Respected Astrological Authority Reveals Her Secrets of Creating and Interpreting Your Personalized Relationship Charts</h2><p>Available in paperback for the very first time, here's everything you need to make your own astrological readings of your most precious relationships<br><br> Why do you feel you've known someone for years when you've just met?<br> Why are you attracted to someone who seems like your complete opposite?<br> Why do you and your loved one argue the way you argue?<br> How can you make your relationships last in spite of your differences?<br><br>The answers to these questions can be found within your birth chart and that of your loved one. <b>Linda Goodman's Relationship Signs</b> is the first astrology book to provide a totally individual, detailed analysis of how compatible you and your partner really are.

But Michell&#x2019;s adventures really begin when, on a weekend in Uruguay, he rescues a penguin covered in oil from an ocean spill, cleans the bird up, and attempts to return him to the sea. The penguin refuses to leave his rescuer&#x2019;s side. &#x201c;That was the moment at which he became my penguin, and whatever the future held, we&#x2019;d face it together,&#x201d; says Michell in this charming memoir.<br><br> Michell names the penguin Juan Salvador (&#x201c;John Saved&#x201d;), but Juan Salvador, as it turns out, is the one who saves Michell.<br><br>After Michell smuggles the bird back to Argentina and into his campus apartment, word spreads about the young Englishman&#x2019;s unusual roommate.

This is his first book.I Pick Up a Penguin<br><br>The seaside resort of Punta del Este can be found at that point on the coast of Uruguay where the great southerly sweep of South America&#x2019;s Atlantic seaboard meets the northern bank of the vast delta of the river Plate, or R�o de la Plata. It lies some sixty miles to the east of the capital, Montevideo, and across the mighty river from Buenos Aires, the capital of the Republic of Argentina. In the 1960s and 1970s Punta del Este was, for the denizens of those two great metropolises, their Nice, Cannes, or St. Tropez. It was the place where the smart set went for summer holidays to escape the city heat, to stay and be seen in luxurious penthouses and apartment blocks facing the sea, and for all I know, they do so still.<br><br>The key to one of those apartments had kindly been lent to me by the Bellamys, friends of mine who, because it was midwinter, were not using it themselves. I was in Uruguay following an extraordinary stay in Paraguay and was making my way back to the Argentine via the gargantuan waterfalls at Iguaz� and then along the coast. After several weeks of exertions and excitements I was content to spend a few days relaxing in quiet out-of-season Punta del Este.<br><br>I had returned to the apartment late in the afternoon on my last day in order to organize my belongings for a very early departure the following morning. My booking for the hydrofoil across the river Plate was for noon, which required that I catch the colectivo, the local bus, from Punta del Este to Montevideo at a quarter to six in the morning. Colectivos were enthusiastically decorated by their drivers with innumerable diverse adornments and good-luck charms, which were supposed to make up for the bald tires, I think.<br><br>Having finished the packing, I cleaned and checked the apartment, then decided to take a final walk by the sea before going out for what would be my last supper at the resort.<br><br>The harbor at Punta del Este, on the western side of the point, was small, sufficient only for a few score fishing boats and pleasure craft, which on that day were rocking gently on their moorings, in harmony with the floating pontoons along which owners could walk to reach their dinghies. Although the harbor is well defended against the Atlantic Ocean to the east, there was little protection from the westerly breeze that was blowing that day.<br><br>The air was full of the cry of gulls, the slap of halyards, and the smell of fish, and this little haven of security basked serenely in the bright winter sunlight. The vibrant colors of the gulls, boats, and houses were shown to their best advantage against the sapphire sea and azure sky. My attention, however, was drawn toward the countless thousands of fish in the cold, crystal-clear water. Swimming in unison, shoals of sprats raced around the harbor, attempting to evade their predators by zigzagging, or by dividing and reuniting every few seconds. I was mesmerized by the scintillating waves of light that pulsed across the water, like an aurora, as the sun reflected off the iridescent bodies of the fish.<br><br>Next to the rusting antiquated fuel pumps marked in gallons, and housed under a corrugated metal roof, a muscle-bound fisherwoman scooped her living from the harbor with a large green net securely tied to a stout bamboo pole. She wore a leather apron, rubber boots, and a satisfied expression, although, I noted, she had bare hands. Her hair was covered with a brown scarf and her face was deeply lined and weathered. Beside her were three wooden casks filled almost to the brim with sprats, which I presumed accounted for her satisfaction. Standing ankle-deep in flapping silver-banded fish, she dropped her net into the water and lifted a fresh catch almost every minute, to the dismay of the gulls, who scolded her noisily. She gave a toothless grin as she shook each new haul into the barrels and picked out the few fish that hadn&#x2019;t fallen from the net, something I realized she couldn&#x2019;t have done wearing gloves. The little black-backed, swallow-tailed gulls, after hovering briefly about ten feet above the sea, dived down, then bobbed up to the surface to sit on the water with sprats glistening like rubber mercury in their beaks. In another flash, the catch was swallowed.<br><br>There were a couple of penguins in the harbor, too, enjoying their share. It was captivating to watch them fly so fast through the water in pursuit of the fish, far more skillfully even than the gulls in the air. Twisting and turning, they tore through the shoals with breathtaking speed and agility, snapping up sprats as the fish scattered before them. Against such a superlative adversary the sprats appeared to be almost defenseless, other, perhaps, than their seemingly limitless numbers. I was only surprised that there weren&#x2019;t more penguins there to feast on such rich and easy pickings.<br><br>I could gladly have watched them for much longer, but as the penguins swam out of view, I turned and walked round the promontory to the eastern side and so on to the next breakwater. Small, white-flecked waves were rolling in from the ocean and breaking on the beach. I had only been strolling along the seashore for ten, maybe fifteen minutes on that beautiful afternoon, reflecting on all my new experiences, the wonderful and awe-inspiring things I had seen and done on holiday, when I caught sight of the first of them: black, unmoving shapes. Initially I was aware of only a few, but as I walked on, they grew in number, until the whole beach appeared to be covered with black lumps in a black carpet. Hundreds of oil-drenched penguins lay dead in the sand, from the high-water mark to the sea, and stretching far away along the shore to the north. Dead penguins, covered in thick, cloying, suffocating oil and tar. The sight was so dreadful, so sickening and depressing, that I could only wonder what future lay ahead for any &#x201c;civilization&#x201d; that could tolerate, let alone perpetrate, such desecration. I understood then why there were so few penguins in the harbor catching sprats, given the abundance of the fish. Evidently only a lucky few had avoided the oil slick.<br><br>Consumed by dark thoughts, I continued my walk above the trail of devastation that covered much of the beach, trying to estimate the number of dead birds. Even if I had been able to calculate how many penguins were on the shore&#x2014;in places heaped on top of each other&#x2014;it was impossible to assess the number of bodies churning in the sea. Each wave that broke piled more birds on top of those already there, while further out every new breaker was sweeping another grim batch of black carcasses toward the shore.<br><br>The beach between the sea and the wall at the side of the road was narrow, possibly only thirty yards at its widest, but the pollution along the beach extended as far as I could see. Clearly thousands of penguins had died in the most horrifying manner while they were making their way north along their ancestral migration routes just as their forebears had done for millions of years.<br><br>I still don&#x2019;t know why I continued to walk along the beach that day. Possibly I needed to understand just how appalling this event was&#x2014;the extent of the damage. I hadn&#x2019;t heard any reports of an oil spill in this part of the world, but in those days regulations regarding the conduct of oil tankers were less stringent and compliance minimal, so occurrences like this were not uncommon. After discharging cargo at their destinations, oil tankers would put to sea again and wash out their tanks while in transit to collect a new consignment.<br><br>It was events such as these that eventually provoked much-needed change. I had little doubt that what I was witnessing on this beach was the inevitable consequence of a hideous collision of cultures. When the instinctive, annual compulsion of seabirds to migrate met a vast, floating oil slick dumped at sea through human thoughtlessness and greed, there was only one possible outcome: the utter and complete annihilation of those penguins. This would have been indescribably ghastly had it been the result of an accident. That it should be the result of deliberate actions taken in the full knowledge of the likely consequences defied any kind of rationalization or acceptance.<br><br>I had been walking briskly, unwilling to focus too closely on the details of the dead creatures, when, out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw a movement. Not from the churning spume of the surf, but from the stillness on the beach. I stopped and watched. I hadn&#x2019;t been mistaken. One valiant bird was alive, a single surviving soul struggling amidst all that death. It was extraordinary! How could one solitary bird still be living when the oil and tar had so comprehensively overwhelmed the rest?<br><br>Although it was lying on its belly and covered in tar like the other birds, this penguin was moving its wings and holding its head up. It wasn&#x2019;t moving much, but its head and wings were giving little spasmodic jerks. The death throes of a defeated creature, I assumed.<br><br>I watched for a short time. Could I walk on and abandon it to the poisonous oil and the exhausting, suffocating tar that would slowly extinguish its life? I decided that I could not; I had to end its suffering as quickly as possible. So I headed toward it, clearing space under each footfall with as much decency and respect for the dead birds as was possible.<br><br>I had no clear plan of how I was going to administer the coup de gr�ce. In fact, I had no plan at all. But as that solitary penguin, indistinguishable from the thousands of other tar-dripping penguins in all but one respect&#x2014;this one was alive&#x2014;struggled to its feet to face yet another adversary, all thoughts of such violence vanished from my mind. Flapping sticky wings at me and with a darting raptor beak, it stood its ground, ready to fight for its life once more. It was almost knee high!<br><br>I checked my advance and looked again at this penguin&#x2019;s companions. Was I wrong? Were they alive after all? Just resting, recovering? I turned a few bodies over with my toe. No spark of life appeared in any bird apart from this one, nothing to distinguish one dead penguin from the next. Their plumage and throats were choked up with tar, hideously deformed tongues were protruding from their beaks, and their eyes were completely covered with the corrosive filth. The stink of tar alone would have overcome the birds, and I wouldn&#x2019;t have been walking along the beach myself had not the wind been blowing from the west, carrying the stench out to sea.<br><br>Amid all this obscenity there was just this single penguin with an open, red-tongued beak and clear eyes, jet black and sparking with anger. I suddenly felt a surge of hope kindling for this exception. Could this one survive if cleaned? I had to give it a chance, surely. But how would I approach this filthy and aggressive bird? We stood there, eyeing each other suspiciously, evaluating our respective opponents.<br><br>Quickly I scanned the accumulated rubbish along the beach: bits of wood, plastic bottles, crumbling Styrofoam, disintegrating fishing net, all the familiar things found along the high-water mark on almost every beach tainted by our advanced society. I also had a paper bag containing an apple in my pocket. As I moved away, the penguin settled back down on its tummy and shook its bottom, as though getting comfortable again. Hurriedly I gathered some of the flotsam and jetsam that I thought might be of assistance. Now, gladiator-like, I approached my quarry, which immediately reared up to its full height in response to this new threat. Swirling a piece of fishing net, I distracted the penguin and, with the swiftness and bravery of Achilles, dropped the net over its head and pushed it over with the stick. I pinned it down and, with my hand inside the bag (it was no time to be eating apples), grabbed its feet.<br><br>I lifted the furious creature, twisting and turning in its efforts to escape, clear of the beach and away from my body and discovered for the first time how heavy penguins could be.<br><br>And so back to the Bellamys&#x2019; apartment with a flapping ten-pound bird. If my arm were to tire and that vicious beak come within striking distance, it would skewer my leg and smear me with tar. I was apprehensive about hurting it or scaring it to death and I was trying to ensure it didn&#x2019;t suffer at my hands, but I was also concerned about my own well-being during the return journey of a mile or more.<br><br>My mind teemed with half-formed plans as I made the return journey. What was I going to say to anyone who challenged me? Was I allowed to pick up tar-soaked penguins in Uruguay? Most countries in South America at that time were police states, and I wouldn&#x2019;t have been surprised had there been some absurd law forbidding such a rescue.<br><br>At least I should be able to clean the penguin, I decided as I jogged unevenly back along the beach road. I remembered we had used butter to remove tar from beach towels when we were children, and I knew I had some butter in the fridge in the flat, as well as olive oil, margarine, and detergent.<br><br>Carrying the bird at arm&#x2019;s length was exhausting work, and I had to change hands frequently. I was holding it by its feet, but, fearful of causing any further injury to the frantic creature, I kept a finger between its legs in order to gauge the strength of my grip. I was under no illusion: this was not comfortable for the bird. However, we eventually reached our destination without major mishap to either of us. Despite its best endeavors, the penguin had failed to wound me&#x2014;and I hadn&#x2019;t been tempted to finish it off en route.<br><br>My next problem was how to slip by the fearsome concierge, who occupied an office under the stairs. Throughout my stay she had come rushing out, like a savage guard dog, to scrutinize all visitors as they came and went, as though we weren&#x2019;t to be trusted. It was abundantly clear why the building management had engaged the services of this particular individual to ensure that visitors behaved respectably during their stay, so naturally suited was she to the task. But by some curious twist of fate, on the one occasion she might have had real cause for concern, she wasn&#x2019;t there. The coast was clear.<br><br>Magellan Penguins<br><br>The populations of penguin colonies have suffered serious decline in the last forty years, some by as much as 80 percent and more.

Their goal: to smash the main factories and production centers of the Luftwaffe while also drawing German planes into an aerial battle of attrition to neutralize the Luftwaffe as a fighting force prior to the cross-channel invasion, planned for a few months later. Officially called Operation ARGUMENT, this aerial offensive quickly became known as &#x201c;Big Week,&#x201d; and it was one of the turning-point engagements of World War II.<br><p><br>In <i>Big Week</i>, acclaimed World War II historian James Holland chronicles the massive air battle through the experiences of those who lived and died during it. Prior to Big Week, the air forces on both sides were in crisis. Allied raids into Germany were being decimated, but German resources&#x2015;fuel and pilots&#x2015;were strained to the breaking point. Ultimately new Allied aircraft&#x2015;especially the American long-range P-51 Mustang&#x2015;and superior tactics won out during Big Week. Through interviews, oral histories, diaries, and official records, Holland follows the fortunes of pilots, crew, and civilians on both sides, taking readers from command headquarters to fighter cockpits to anti-aircraft positions and civilian chaos on the ground, vividly recreating the campaign as it was conceived and unfolded. In the end, the six days of intense air battles largely cleared the skies of enemy aircraft when the invasion took place on June 6, 1944&#x2015;D-Day.<br></p><p><br><i>Big Week</i> is both an original contribution to WWII literature and a brilliant piece of narrative history, recapturing a largely forgotten campaign that was one of the most critically important periods of the entire war.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of November 2018:</strong> In February of 1944, the Allies launched an air offensive against Germany designed to destroy factories and draw the Luftwaffe into a battle of attrition. Dubbed Operation ARGUMENT, the biggest air battle of WWII had a hidden agenda: to soften up German air power in preparation for D-Day later in the summer. The battle was also known as &#x201c;Big Week,&#x201d; and James Holland&#x2019;s book of the same name is a top-rate World War II book, one that describes the big movements and tactical decisions at the same time that it sweeps us into the action and explores the exploits of characters on both sides.

Grant heeded the advice of Mark Twain and finally agreed to write his memoirs. Little did Grant or Twain realize that this seemingly straightforward decision would profoundly alter not only both their lives but the course of American literature. Over the next fifteen months, as the two men became close friends and intimate collaborators, Grant raced against the spread of cancer to compose a triumphant account of his life and times&#x2014;while Twain struggled to complete and publish his greatest novel, <b>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</b><i>.</i>In this deeply moving and meticulously researched book, veteran writer Mark Perry reconstructs the heady months when Grant and Twain inspired and cajoled each other to create two quintessentially American masterpieces.<br><br>In a bold and colorful narrative, Perry recounts the early careers of these two giants, traces their quest for fame and elusive fortunes, and then follows the series of events that brought them together as friends. The reason Grant let Twain talk him into writing his memoirs was simple: He was bankrupt and needed the money. Twain promised Grant princely returns in exchange for the right to edit and publish the book&#x2014;and though the writer&#x2019;s own finances were tottering, he kept his word to the general and his family.<br><br>Mortally ill and battling debts, magazine editors, and a constant crush of reporters, Grant fought bravely to get the story of his life and his Civil War victories down on paper. Twain, meanwhile, staked all his hopes, both financial and literary, on the tale of a ragged boy and a runaway slave that he had been unable to finish for decades. As Perry delves into the story of the men&#x2019;s deepening friendship and mutual influence, he arrives at the startling discovery of the true model for the character of Huckleberry Finn.<br><br>With a cast of fascinating characters, including General William T. Sherman, William Dean Howells, William Henry Vanderbilt, and Abraham Lincoln, Perry&#x2019;s narrative takes in the whole sweep of a glittering, unscrupulous age. A story of friendship and history, inspiration and desperation, genius and ruin, <b>Grant and Twain </b>captures a pivotal moment in the lives of two towering Americans and the age they epitomized.</p><p><b>MARK PERRY</b>, writer, reporter, and foreign policy analyst, has published articles in dozens of magazines and newspapers, including <i>The Nation</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i>, the<i> Los Angeles Times</i>, and <i>New York Newsday</i>.

Grant never understood how to handle money. That was not true of his father, Jesse, who understood it so well that he became a successful and affluent businessman. A tanner by trade, Jesse Grant came to the Ohio country and opened a business in Point Pleasant, a small trading town on the Ohio River. Tanning is a dirty and bloody business, but it&#x2019;s honorable and ancient: The apostle Paul was a tanner, a fact undoubtedly pointed out repeatedly by Jesse&#x2019;s devout and dour Methodist wife, Hannah. Hannah Simpson was a strong-willed Pennsylvania woman who believed that work could save souls and who told people (apparently with some repetition) that she wanted to live &#x201c;unspotted from the world.&#x201d; People noted that she meant what she said. Hannah worked from sunrise to sunset, like her husband, Jesse, whose face was pockmarked by tannic acid but whose biceps were as hard as iron cannon&#x2014;the result of throwing ungainly pickled hides out to dry.<br><br>Ulysses was Jesse and Hannah&#x2019;s first child, born with the name Hiram Ulysses Grant in a single-room clapboard shack at Point Pleasant on April 27, 1822. Jesse worked hard for his new family, and eight months later the shack was replaced by a two-room house at Georgetown, twenty-five miles to the east. The move reflected Jesse Grant&#x2019;s rising status and unerring business sense. Georgetown was not only on a major highway leading from Pittsburgh west into the rich farmlands of Illinois and Wisconsin, it was also in the middle of one of Ohio&#x2019;s most expansive oak forests; oak bark, when mixed with water, makes tannic acid, the potion that produces tanned hides. Within five years, Jesse Grant had transformed his business from a small one-man operation into a burgeoning enterprise employing five workers and dozens of returning satisfied customers. With his profits Jesse acquired fifty acres of prime forest land, two small farms, and a two-story brick house. The house was sparsely furnished, as Hannah insisted, and over the next years she gave birth to five more children, two boys and three girls: Simpson, Clara, Virginia, Orvil, and Mary.<br><br>Just five years after coming to Ohio, Jesse Grant was a success. He not only owned a profitable tanning business, he was one of Georgetown&#x2019;s most important citizens. He ran for office (as an abolitionist), participated in town meetings, and was a regular and outspoken contributor to the town newspaper, the Castigator. He designed and built the town jail and even started another business, opening a carriage service to western Ohio and points south. But Jesse was not well liked: He argued heatedly with Georgetown&#x2019;s pro-southern elite (who were enriched by the region&#x2019;s slave-dependent tobacco-trading industry), became a &#x201c;Clay man&#x201d; (and voted repeatedly for Henry Clay, that most eloquent of voices for the Union), shouted down his opponents at town meetings, and regularly and vocally proselytized for the Whig Party. As his employees were busy slinging hides, Jesse Grant stood in front of his store and argued about slavery. Jesse hated slavery: Before he came to Ohio, he was an apprentice tanner in Kentucky but left the state because, as he said proudly, it was poisoned by &#x201c;the slavocracy.&#x201d; It was his obsession with slavery and his sour personality that made Jesse disliked: His first son once commented that in that part of Ohio, antiabolitionist sentiment was so strong that Jefferson Davis might have been elected president.<br><br>That Jesse Grant could see the coming conflict was certain. He was ahead of his time. Though the nation was not yet divided by the slave question, the first cracks in the foundation of the Union were beginning to show. In the year that Ulysses S. Grant was born, Denmark Vesey was put on trial and executed in Charleston for plotting a slave uprising. Two years before, Henry Clay&#x2014;then a rising young politician from the same Kentucky that Jesse abhorred&#x2014;authored the Missouri Compromise, which saved the Union. The debate over slavery deepened in 1828, when Ulysses was just six, when John Quincy Adams signed the &#x201c;Tariff of Abominations,&#x201d; which favored the business interests of the North and the West over those of the South. South Carolina threatened secession. Two years later, Daniel Webster of Massachusetts and Robert Y. Hayne of South Carolina debated the question of slavery on the Senate floor. The compromises and debates of the 1820s carried over into the next decade. In 1831, Nat Turner launched a bloody and unsuccessful slave rebellion in Virginia. In the years that followed, new &#x201c;slave laws&#x201d; were enacted throughout the South, and the trickle of African Americans that traversed the underground railroad, many of them through Ohio, became a torrent.<br><br>Jesse Grant was proud of his son Ulysses and showed him off to anyone who came into his store. The boy was strong and smart and understood more about horses than anyone Jesse knew. Horses came to Ulysses like money to Jesse. Throughout his life, Grant had an affinity for horses and could gentle the wildest in any herd. His gift with horses was obvious from an early age. When his mother was warned that her three-year-old son was crawling in the yard beneath horses&#x2019; hooves, she dismissed the danger. He will take care of himself, she said, and went back to her washing. Ulysses Grant found in horses a silent trust and compassion that was nonexistent at home. His mother never kissed or hugged him (&#x201c;Well, Ulysses, you&#x2019;ve become quite a great man, haven&#x2019;t you,&#x201d; she said coldly after his return from the war&#x2014;and then went back to her work), and his father, while bragging about his son&#x2019;s strength and spirit, rarely showed any affection. Jesse was self-made, pugnacious, outspoken, and hardworking, and he expected his son to be the same, so he demanded that Ulysses help in the shop at a very early age. Ulysses abhorred the backbreaking work and the animal blood, but he did it. At the age of fifteen, after his father suggested that he might follow him in the business, Ulysses told him he never would. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll work at it though, if you wish me to, until I am twenty-one. But you may depend on it, I&#x2019;ll never work a day longer at it after that,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Grant&#x2019;s personality was formed in opposition to his father. Where Jesse was outgoing and outspoken, Ulysses was shy and contained. He grew up to be a man of few words, though those few, when spoken, were well chosen. His beliefs were held deeply, like his father&#x2019;s, but his aversion to argument was developed at a very young age. While he served two terms as president, he was arguably the least political of any of our presidents, and while he enjoyed those most common of pleasures, smoking cigars and reading, he was nearly an ascetic. He bore the casual hooting and indiscreet bullyings of childhood, most of them the result of his father&#x2019;s outspoken (and often obnoxious) personality, without complaint, as he would later bear the privations of soldiering. He was as fearless in battle as he was beneath the hooves of those horses in his mother&#x2019;s yard, and several times during the Civil War he would look up, surprised, to see his staff scattering before the onslaught of an artillery barrage.<br><br>All of this might have come from his mother, Hannah Simpson, except that unlike her, he was never devout and viewed religion as he might have looked at cannonballs&#x2014;a curious nuisance that caused more fear than harm and simply had to be tolerated. That he was intelligent was never in doubt, but he lacked scholarly brilliance. He mastered mathematics, as a child, simply by working at it. He worked diligently, but without remarkable insight. That perhaps was Grant&#x2019;s most sterling quality. While not the tallest, or strongest, or brightest, or even the most insightful of men or generals, Grant brought a singular concentration to everything he did. When he failed, he would pick himself up and start again. As a child and later as a soldier, he was undeterred, unfazed, and unafraid. This might well have come from working in his father&#x2019;s business, with older and stronger men, or perhaps from those he met on the road&#x2014;as he drove his father&#x2019;s hides to Cincinnati or farther south or west. His only truly unique and eccentric quality was his inability to turn back, to literally retrace his steps. If lost, he plunged on rather than retrace where he had been, and he sometimes went miles out of his way rather than return along a well-worn road. He commented on this himself, often, and admitted that it was an obsessive quirk that he simply could not correct. That oddity defined his life: He would set out to do something and would not stop until he got it done&#x2014;and he would go someplace and get there.<br><br>If Jesse and Hannah were unaffectionate, they still placed great hope in their oldest son. His mother insisted that he receive a better education than his playmates, and while Ulysses was in his teens, Jesse told him that he would be expected to go to college, a privilege reserved for only the most well-educated, and affluent, children. Jesse made enough money to enroll his son in a number of private schools, including a &#x201c;village school&#x201d; run by Thomas White, a strict disciplinarian who gave his students a book, a desk, and little else. White expected his pupils to teach themselves, emphasizing the point by keeping at hand a switch made of hard cane bundled together. At the insistence of his parents, Grant next attended a private school in Maysville, Kentucky. He left home for Maysville at the age of thirteen and lived there with an aunt. He attended school during the day and studied at night. One year later, he was enrolled by his father at a private academy in Ripley, on the Ohio River, where the academic work was more difficult than any he had ever had. &#x201c;They taught me that a noun was the name of a person, place or thing so often that I came to believe it,&#x201d; he later said.<br><br>Jesse Grant&#x2019;s son had big ideas. From the moment he began to lead his father&#x2019;s buckboards out of Georgetown, Grant dreamed of becoming a river trader. He admired the well-dressed men striding onto the steamboats of Cincinnati, bound for those exotic river towns of St. Louis, Natchez, and New Orleans. He also thought of becoming a farmer, though this was far less romantic. But farming was a thing he could do, and it didn&#x2019;t involve dipping his hands in animal blood. And that was good enough for him. It was not good enough for Jesse, however, or for Hannah, who had definite opinions about what their son could become. Downriver traders, Jesse thought, were thoroughly disreputable. Being one would not likely bring honor to the Grant family, and as for being a farmer, well, anyone could be a farmer&#x2014;and most people were. The Grants, as Jesse would say, were not most people. In 1838, Jesse wrote to Ohio senator Thomas Morris about Ulysses, asking that Morris appoint his son to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Morris replied that he did not then have an appointment to give, but that Congressman Thomas Hamer did, if Jesse was willing to write to him.<br><br>It was an audacious request. Jesse had not thought of sending his son to West Point until his wife had suggested it, and she did so only after hearing that a neighbor&#x2019;s son had failed the entrance examination. More important, Hamer and Jesse Grant were political enemies. While Jesse had campaigned for Hamer when Hamer ran for a seat in Ohio&#x2019;s legislature, the two had had a bitter argument over President Andrew Jackson&#x2019;s fiscal policies and had not spoken since. But Jesse swallowed his pride and wrote to Hamer, hoping that his former friend would remember how close they had once been. Hamer received Jesse&#x2019;s letter on the last day of his term and immediately filled out the application for Grant&#x2019;s admission. The application was to have lifelong ramifications for Grant: Struggling to remember the boy&#x2019;s full name, Hamer appointed him to West Point as Ulysses S. Grant, using his mother&#x2019;s maiden name as his middle initial. He then wrote to Jesse, burying the bitter feud: &#x201c;I received your letter and have asked for the appointment of your son which will doubtless be made. Why didn&#x2019;t you apply to me sooner?&#x201d;<br><br>But being appointed to West Point was one thing, passing the entrance examination was another. The people of Georgetown, many of them offended by Jesse Grant&#x2019;s presumption, believed that his son would never attend. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m astonished Hamer did not appoint someone with intellect enough to do credit to our district,&#x201d; one of the townsmen told Jesse. Ulysses knew none of this and protested the appointment when he heard of it. He told his father that he thought he would not go. But, as he later recounted, &#x201c;My father said he thought I would, and I thought so too, if he did.&#x201d; Grant passed the entrance exam and, vowing secretly that he would never like West Point and that he would never be a soldier (no matter what his father thought), left for New York on May 15, 1839. He arrived, a little more than one week later, on the bluffs above the Hudson, to see his name posted with those of the others of the class of 1843.<br>R<br><br>It was then, and still is, a tradition at West Point that en- tering plebes receive a nickname. The West Point of Grant&#x2019;s era is famous for such names. William Tecumseh Sherman (one class ahead of Grant) became &#x201c;Cump,&#x201d; while William Rosecrans (a devoted Catholic, gifted mathematician, and average general) became &#x201c;Rosie.&#x201d; Winfield Scott Hancock (who was named for the old general, and who repelled Pickett&#x2019;s charge at Gettysburg) became &#x201c;Win.&#x201d; All of that is predictable, but how do you explain James Longstreet, who was known ever after as &#x201c;Pete,&#x201d; or George Pickett (a Virginian appointed by a then little-known congressman from Illinois named Abraham Lincoln), who was so dandified that he had no nickname at all (and who graduated dead last in his class), or Lewis Armistead, who became &#x201c;Lo&#x201d;&#x2014;for &#x201c;Lothario&#x201d;&#x2014;and who died in the charge that Pickett commanded? As Hiram Ulysses Grant became Ulysses Simpson Grant, so Ulysses Simpson Grant now became U. S. Grant or, more simply, &#x201c;Sam.&#x201d; No protests that he (Hiram, or Ulysses, or even U. S. Grant) would ever issue would change that name. Among his closest friends, from his plebe year forward, Ulysses S. Grant was &#x201c;Sam&#x201d; Grant, and so he would forever remain.<br><br>Grant entered West Point as the smallest cadet in his class. He stood barely five feet one, and he weighed just 117 pounds. He was issued a uniform that, in using language his father would understand, he described as being &#x201c;as tight to my skin as bark to a tree.&#x201d; It would have been easy to underestimate Grant. He struggled with his studies, but he rarely broke the academy rules, and he seemed to get along well with the upperclass officers. His class of seventy-seven comprised mostly boys from the South and the Northeast, with only a scattering of midwesterners. Grant endured his plebe year and stood aside when others protested, or openly rebelled, or were expelled for fighting or complaining. In that first year he never once received a demerit for disobedience or disrespect, a rarity among cadets in any age. He was well liked, but years later (when it would have been in people&#x2019;s interest to regale listeners with stories of the famous cadet Ulysses S. &#x201c;Sam&#x201d; Grant), he was not well remembered. Pickett, Rosecrans, Longstreet, Sherman, and even future Confederate general Jubal Early (called &#x201c;my bad old man&#x201d; during the war by Robert E. Lee were legends at West Point. Grant was a plodding enigma.<br><br>Grant finished his first year near the bottom of his class, but he had come further than anyone dared imagine. While the people of Georgetown, Kentucky, might well have protested Grant&#x2019;s appointment, no one could argue with his ability to concentrate, to apply himself single-mindedly to his weaknesses and master them.

The oldest stories were from ancient Sumer and these gods were called the Anunnaki or Nephilim, also known as the Fallen Ones. They were considered fallen after co-mingling with the daughters of men, so their realm became the Earth rather than the "heaven" from which they came. Their offspring were said to be giants and these myths and legends are found throughout the world. The author spent years of study to reveal an accurate, chronological history of these ancient beings, unveiling in this book a calendar of their events more accurate than anything previously known. This book takes vast research on worldwide myths, earth changes documented from cultures worldwide, and the author's immense work on planetary cycles to predict the return of these fallen ones, their planet, and the chaos and catastrophe that always came with them.

Founded in New York City in 1816, ABS is dedicated to the purpose of presenting the Bible in compelling ways, enabling readers to experience life in its fullness through faith in Jesus Christ. ABS has a number of &#34;firsts&#34; in its record books: the first Bibles in hotels, the first pocket Bibles for soldiers (during the Civil war), and the first Bibles provided for the U.S. Military in 1817. The Society extends its outreach internationally through the United Bible Societies (UBS), a fellowship of 126 international Bible societies, and was instrumental in founding this global fellowship in the interest of greater ministry impact and efficiency. In 1999 alone, more than 63 million copies of the Society&#39;s publications were distributed throughout the United States and the world. The CONTEMPORARY ENGLISH VERSION was published by the American Bible Society in response to an urgent need for a translation that would reach those many millions who are not reading the Bible. The goal was a Bible that is a serious translation-not a paraphrase-that combines historical and scholarly accuracy with contemporary language that everyone can understand. The result is a Bible that resonates with all people, wherever they may be in their spiritual journey. At last, a Bible that is easy to read, yet allows for a deeper connection to the very God who created us. Never before has there been a Bible that speaks so clearly to the heart and the mind of every reader.</p><h2>Do What You Love, The Money Will Follow: Discovering Your Right Livelihood</h2><p><b>No More Monday Morning Blues...</b><br><br>You're about to be liberated!

His character, manner, and ethic resemble that of Harry Callahan (Dirty Harry), and thanks to James Daniels, so does his voice. When Daniels isn't portraying Pike, his glib delivery moves the action along. And there's plenty of that when Pike is hired to protect a rich 22-year-old from L.A. Seems that she's seen something--or someone--she shouldn't have. Fifteen minutes into this thriller, Pike has blown away five villains, with more to come. In between, Crais's stories of Pike's past lives--as Marine, cop, and mercenary--make Dirty Harry pale in comparison. It appears that Crais has another winning character.

Through dozens of handy tables, diagrams, and charts, Monona Rossol&#x2019;s essential book points out dangerous ingredients found in specific brands of paint, dye, and adhesives; simple supplies such as goggles and ladders that keep classrooms and studios safe; and steps that art educators can take to comply with OSHA regulations. This volume also details helpful and potentially life-saving subjects such as:<br><ul><li>Questions to ask when ordering art supplies </li><li>Recommendations for proper ventilation </li><li>Safe work practices </li><li>Precautions for individual media </li><li>Art materials and projects for children and other high risk individuals</li></ul><br>Not only artists, but those who work in school administration, health care, and risk analysis will benefit from the surprising facts revealed. For example, art and craft supplies labeled as biodegradable, water-based, and natural must be handled with utmost caution, because they can still contain highly toxic properties.</p><p>Artists, craftspeople, and students have witnessed a small revolution in concern for health and safety in their field. High-profile illnesses, accidents, and lawsuits have led to complex laws throughout the United States and Canada. People who handle arts and crafts materials, meanwhile, are still too often confused about what is safe, what is hazardous, and what is legal&#x2014;often neglecting the regulations created for their own protection. For all people involved in arts and crafts, the definitive guide has arrived. Health and safety expert Monona Rossol has fully revised and expanded the classic reference The Artist&#x2019;s Complete Health and Safety Guide.As both a chemist and an artist, Rossol brings much-needed clarity and balance to her subject. This guide emphasizes that health and safety need not be at odds with creativity as it shows artists how to handle their materials safely while practicing their craft. &#x201c;Either we can see these new laws as impositions and resist them at every turn, or we can accept change and do our share in protecting ourselves and the environment,&#x201d; Rossol observes.</p><h2>The Little Airplane (Lois Lenski Books)</h2><p>Mr. Small is a high-flying pilot in this adventure!

But at the age of 24, with his best years still ahead, long-distance runner Steve Prefontaine finally lost. Driving alone at night after a party, Prefontaine crashed his sports car, putting a tragic, shocking end to the life and career of one of the most influential, accomplished runners of our time.<br><br>More than 20 years later, Pre continues to influence the running world.<br><br>From his humble origins in Coos Bay, Oregon, Pre became the first person to win four NCAA titles in one event. Year after year, he was virtually unbeatable. Instead of becoming one of the new breed of professional track athletes, Pre chose to stay amateur and fight for the adequate funding he felt American amateur athletes deserved.<br><br>A man of incredible desire and energy, Pre trained relentlessly. In his drive to be the best, he spurred others to do their best. As one racer said, "He ran every race as if it were his last."<br><br>But Pre not only touched runners; his exciting technique as well as his maverick lifestyle made him a favorite of the fans. A race with Prefontaine in it was automatically an event.<br><br>His brief but brilliant life&#x2014;documented by author Tom Jordan&#x2014;is the tale of a true American hero.<br><br>This is his story.<br><br>"Some people create with words or with music or with a brush and paints. I like to make something beautiful when I run. I like to make people stop and say, 'I've never seen anyone run like that before.' It's more than just a race, it's style. It's doing something better than anyone else. It's being creative." &#x2014;Steve Prefontaine</p><p>Written in 1977, this biography was evidently resurrected because of a recent TV special and two planned motion pictures about the Oregon long-distance runner, whose life was cut short in 1975 when he crashed his sports car at age 24. The book gives details of Prefontaine's efforts on the track?where he set many national records, some even while in college?and demonstrates his dedication to running, but it tells readers little about his personal life, perhaps because, as Jordan points out in the introduction, "His pace was so frenetic... that his deep friendships outside of family and love relationships were few." The two major problems Pre encountered as an athlete were his inability to do as well in Europe as at home and his annoyance with the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) and its demand that amateur athletes accept no formal support, although, the author notes, many meets gave under-the-table payments to top box-office draws. Jordan, who is on the staff of Track &amp; Field News, captures his subject's charisma, but his book seems incomplete. There are six sidebars about Prefontaine by noted runners including Alberto Salazar, Mary Slaney and Frank Shorter. Photos. (Apr.) FYI: The film Prefontaine is playing at theaters now. Disney will release a film on the runner later this year.<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.University of Oregon track star Prefontaine finished fourth in the [5000 meter] race at the 1972 Munich Olympics. Beyond that, he set numerous American records. But it was his personality, not his records, that set him apart. Where his opponents were dry and colorless, Pre was brash and cocky. His tragic death in a 1975 one-car accident established him as the James Dean of distance running, and the release of two 1997 motion pictures about him secures this status. Jordan's updated edition of a 1977 biography is acceptable as sports bios go, but there are too many stride-by-stride race accounts. Still, Jordan does create a vivid sense of Prefontaine's driven personality. Peppered throughout are revealing comments from rivals, teammates, and coaches, including legendary Oregon track coach Bill Bowerman. On balance, this is an intelligent glimpse of an athlete who is destined to be more well known today than he was in his lifetime. Expect demand. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i></p><h2>Gus &amp; Me: The Story of My Granddad and My First Guitar</h2><p>Long before there was a band, there was a boy: a young Keith Richards, who was introduced to the joy of music through his beloved granddad, Theodore Augustus Dupree, affectionately known as "Gus," who was in a jazz big band and is the namesake of Keith's daughter, Theodora Dupree Richards. <i>Gus &amp; Me</i> offers a rare and intimate look into the childhood of the legendary Keith Richards through this poignant and inspiring story that is lovingly illustrated with Theodora Richards's exquisite pen-and-ink collages. This unique autobiographical picture book honors the special bond between a grandfather and grandson and celebrates the artistic talents of the Richards family through the generations. It also includes selected photographs from the Richards family collection and an exclusive audio CD featuring bonus content.</p><p>Keith Richards is a musician, singer, songwriter, and founding member of the rock band the Rolling Stones. Widely considered one of the best guitarists in the world, he has a collection of over 350 guitars. His memoir, <i>Life</i>, received unanimous critical acclaim and was a #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller. Mr. Richards has five children and five grandchildren.<br>Theodora Dupree Richards, named after her great-grandfather Theodore Augustus Dupree, is an artist and a daughter of Keith Richards and Patti Hansen. To research the images for this project, she traveled to the Richards family home in Dartford, England, and consulted family and historical photographs of her father's childhood era. This is her first book.K-Gr 2&#x2014;Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards has penned a poignant picture book depicting his close relationship with his grandfather Gus. The author is keenly aware that his musical accomplishments will mean little to the book's target audience and focuses entirely on his childhood, rather than on his later career. Back matter gives readers some basics on his life, including the charmingly humble statement "Keith later began playing in a band with a group of friends, including Mick Jagger. They called themselves the Rolling Stones." He relates his experiences spending time with Gus, who took the boy on walks and gave him his first guitar, which started a lifelong passion for music. There's little of the hilariously snarky Keith that adult readers will know from his autobiography, Life (Little, Brown, 2011); written in free verse, the text is tender, though never cloying, and both the author's love for music and his grandfather come through. Loose black-and-white pen-and-ink illustrations, done by Keith's daughter, affectionately depict the title characters, as well as the various objects in their orbit (musical instruments, Big Ben, tea kettles, a double-decker bus), while backgrounds provide rich washes of purples, blues, yellows, and green, emphasizing the beauty and the sense of magic of the music.

Chava Rosenfarb, herself a survivor of the Lodz Ghetto, Auschwitz, and Bergen-Belsen, draws on her own history to create characters who struggle daily to retain a sense of humanity and dignity despite the physical and psychological effects of ghetto life. Although the novel depicts horrendous experiences, the light of faith in the human spirit shines through every page.</p><p>Winner, Georges Bugnet Award for Best Novel, Writers Guild of Alberta</p></p><p>Chava Rosenfarb is a Holocaust survivor who has published poetry, prose, and drama in both English and Yiddish. Her English titles include <i>Survivors: Seven Short Stories</i>; <i>Bociany;</i> and <i>Of Lodz and Love</i>. She now resides in Alberta, Canada.Originally published in Yiddish in 1972, this final volume of a trilogy depicting daily life in the Lodz ghetto recreates the frantic desperation as thousands of Jews were forced to board cattle trains bound for Auschwitz. Revisiting characters from the first two books, Rosenfarb&#x2014;herself a Lodz ghetto and concentration-camp survivor&#x2014;gets very close to the horror. Adam Rosenberg, who once owned the biggest factory in town, hides under an assumed name and shovels excrement for a living until he is found out and becomes an informant, identifying other Jewish industrialists and sniffing out their hidden valuables. The poet Bunim Berkovitch discovers that his wife and children, including a newborn, have been arrested while he was out fetching their potato ration. And the hated leader of the Jewish Council who composes the dreaded transport lists can't save himself or his loved ones when the ghetto is "liquidated." In this third volume, the prose is denser, the translation more ungainly, and the plotting more chaotic than in the previous two volumes (also available from Wisconsin), but it carries potent witness. <i>(Sept. 20)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Dr. McCullough&#x2019;s thesis that individuals must be responsible for their own wellness &#x2013; starting in great part through their food awareness &#x2013; is a bedrock rationale for the future." (Pete Hardin, <i>The Milkweed</i>)</p> <p>Americans have stopped being watchdogs over their own food supply. Roughly 100 years ago, with the birth of the FDA, we handed that responsibility over to the government and the food industry. They, in turn, have fundamentally transformed our food supply and it&#x2019;s making us sick, including our children. Not only are we losing our health to food related illnesses like cancer and heart disease, we are losing our freedom. Did you know that government and the food industry have already chosen your dinner for you? In fact, the government nudges you to pick the foods they want you to eat. They&#x2019;ve been doing it your whole life.</p> <p>In <i>Hands Off My Food!</i> Dr. McCullough, a Ph.D. in Nutrition from the University of California at Davis, walks you through the truth behind what&#x2019;s currently in our food and how it got there. You may be surprised to learn that our food system is not designed to protect our long-term health. Both the food industry and the government have played a major role in the demise of our food supply, but they are not the root of the problem. Dr. McCullough reveals who is ultimately responsible for the adulteration of our food and how each of us has the power to restore the integrity of the food we eat by taking back our consent. Together we can reclaim our voice by becoming the watchdogs we were meant to be.

Stelson first heard Sachiko speak in August of 2005. From 2010&#x2013;15, Stelson traveled to and from Nagasaki, conducting a series of five interviews with the singular Sachiko. The result is <strong>a story of staggering hardship and extraordinary resolve</strong>. In it, Stelson outlines the plight of Sachiko, her family, and other <em>hibakusha</em> ('explosion-affected people'), from the Yasuis' lengthy trek to safety in nearby Shimbara and decimating radiation sickness, to the grueling restoration of a barren city. The narrative is further supplemented by two-page educational tidbits, interspersed throughout. Here, Stelson addresses the Japanese government, Emperor Hirohito and prime minister Hideko Tojo, internment camps, the U.S.'s stifling occupation of Japan, and 'long-term effects of radiation.' With Sachiko forever in the foreground, readers learn of her grievous loss, devotion to education, regard for peace (and its devotees: Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., Helen Keller), and her fairly recent decision to give voice to her experiences. <strong>Sachiko and her story</strong>, much like the resilient Nagasaki camphor trees she so admires, <strong>are an indelible force. Luminous, enduring, utterly necessary.</strong>"&#x2015;starred,<em> Booklist</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Caren Stelson's 'Sachiko: A Nagasaki Bomb Survivor's Story' presents with equal clarity the devastation of the atomic bombing on one small girl. Six-year-old Sachiko was playing outside with friends half a mile from the hypocenter when the bomb fell on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945. Her four friends died instantly, but all of Sachiko's family except her 2-year-old brother survived the initial explosion. Within days one brother died of radiation sickness and another from infection. Sachiko, her sister Misa, her mother and her father all suffered terribly from radiation sickness; Misa died of leukemia without ever being strong enough to attend school.<br>Despite their shattered lives, extreme poverty and desolation, Sachiko's father spoke to her of peace: 'Hate only produces hate.' He taught her about Mohandas K. Gandhi and about Helen Keller, who visited Nagasaki in 1948. As hibakusha, or 'explosion-affected people,' Sachiko and her parents remained in the mushroom cloud's shadow: Her father died of liver cancer, and Sachiko herself overcame thyroid cancer but had to work hard to regain the ability to speak. She worked as an accountant and studied the words of Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. As the 50th anniversary of the atomic bomb on Nagasaki approached, Sachiko found she had something to say. For the next 20 years she traveled in North America and Japan, spreading a message of peace.<br>Caren Stelson met Sachiko Yasui in Minneapolis in 2005 and made five trips to Japan to interview her. While the book contains historical notes, informational sidebars, photographs and maps, most of the narrative is <strong>Sachiko's account, magnetic and chilling in its simplicity</strong>. Stelson lets Sachiko become the hero of her own story; her quiet survival is an inspiring trajectory of redemption. Like McCormick, <strong>Stelson has created a book that is both personal and universal, both thoroughly researched and real.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>The New York Times</em></p> (<i>Newspaper</i>)<br><br><p>"The result of extensive interviews with Nagasaki atomic bomb survivor Sachiko Yasui, Stelson's <strong>sensitively crafted account</strong> spans fifty years of Yasui's life, starting in August 1945 when the bomb was dropped (she was six years old) and ending in August 1995, when Yasui agreed to speak publicly about her experiences for the first time. Stelson structures her narrative around Yasui's decades-long struggle to find the courage to share her traumatic story with others; her eventual decision to finally speak up&#x2015;'What happened to me must never happen to you'&#x2015;is movingly foreshadowed when, years after the bomb, Yasui fights to regain her voice after radiation-related thyroid cancer takes away her ability to talk. Stelson wisely uses a limited-omniscient point of view, allowing readers to see events through Yasui's eyes but not become overwhelmed by the horrors she endured. Her <strong>tragic tale is full of terror and despair, but hope and peace also loom large</strong>, as Yasui finds strength and inspiration in such figures as Helen Keller, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr. Interspersed with ten brief, informative essays ('Racism and War,' 'Radiation Sickness,' 'The H-Bomb,' etc.) and illustrated with numerous photos, <strong>this is a significant addition to the available material.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>The Horn Book Magazine</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Books about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki for young people are plentiful, but <strong>very few focus on the hibakusha, survivors of the bombings, and this important biography notably fills that gap</strong>.

After briefly describing the impact of the war on Sachiko's life, Stelson focuses on the immediate aftermath and the years that followed, culminating in 1995, the 50th anniversary of the bombing, when Sachiko began sharing her experiences publicly. The narrative effectively conveys the long-lasting effects of the bombings, including such radiation-related maladies as leukemia and thyroid cancer. Stelson acknowledges that the "necessity" of the atomic bombing to end the war with Japan is debatable. Although Stelson interviewed Sachiko extensively, direct quotes, which would add significant impact to the narrative, are not used, and oddly absent is any sense of Sachiko's feelings about the bombing. Hibakusha typically speak of the atomic bombings as an important lesson to the world and display a sense of goodwill and understanding rather than animosity or bitterness. There is also no discussion about why the United States bombed Nagasaki so soon after Hiroshima, giving the Japanese so little time to assess and respond to the first attack. <strong>An important perspective</strong> on the atomic bombings, a controversial decision that continues to provoke passionate debate."&#x2015;<em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Sachiko Yasui was just six years old when the atomic bomb was dropped on her hometown of Nagasaki. On August 9, 1945, she went from playing house with her friends to burying them. Yasui also lost a brother that day and would lose many more family members because of radiation sickness. Growing up, she was ostracized for her status as <em>hibakusha</em>, a bomb survivor. Despite her trauma and the bullying she faced, Yasui endured. She sought out inspiration from the likes of Helen Keller, Mohandas Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr. Their works allowed her to make peace with the events in her life. Stelson recounts hearing Yasui speak at a ceremony to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This event would spark a long and intimate process in which Stelson repeatedly met with and interviewed Yasui in order to tell her story. Frequent historical notes provide context to the events happening in the narrative: Japan's role in World War II, the issue of racism in the war, President Truman's ultimatum, the effects of radiation sickness, the U.S. occupation of Japan after the war, and more. Back matter includes a glossary of Japanese terms used in the book and detailed maps of where events took place.

Photographs and short essays on topics that include 'Racism and War,' 'Little Boy and Fat Man' (code names for the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively), and 'Long-Term Effects of Radiation' provide illuminating background.

His message of the unity of humankind and harmony of religions was embraced by the public and press of the time as representing the essence of the Parliament. The Swami wished to create a bridge between the East and the West by bringing to America the gift of India's ancient spirituality, in exchange for the scientific and industrial outlook of the West. After four years of traveling and teaching in America and Europe, the Swami returned to India, where he is revered as a "Patriot Saint." The government of India has declared his birthday a national holiday. In 1976 on the occasion of the American Bicentennial, Swami Vivekananda was honored by the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery as one who came to America from abroad during the past 200 years and made a significant impact on its spiritual development. <p>Upon his return to India, Swami Vivekananda founded The Ramakrishna Order of India in the name of his teacher, Sri Ramakrishna, who is regarded as the Prophet of Harmony of Religions. The Order is the pre-eminent religious organization of modern India. More than 1000 monks of the Order serve throughout the world. While in the West the work is mainly in the form of conducting worship, teaching, writing and lecturing, in India the Order is widely known for its vast charitable activities -- running hospitals and schools, rural uplift, and extensive relief work in times of emergency. The Swamis of the Order work tirelessly in the spirit of "Service of God in Man," regarding the service of all people as a veritable form of worship. </p><p>The Centers of the Order in America, often referred to by such names as Ramakrishna or Vivekananda Centers, or Vedanta Societies, were first organized by Swami Vivekananda for the propagation of the Swami's teachings. Today there are Centers in many of America's major cities, including New York, Boston, Providence, Chicago, St. Louis, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Berkeley, Sacramento, and Hollywood. Because of their belief in the underlying truth of all religions, the Centers of the Ramakrishna Order are at the forefront of the Interfaith Movement.

Drawing on photos, anecdotes, and, most important, the way he hears the music, Dyer imaginatively reconstructs scenes from the embattled lives of some of the greats: Lester Young fading away in a hotel room; Charles Mingus storming down the streets of New York on a too-small bicycle; Thelonious Monk creating his own private language on the piano. However, music is the driving force of <i>But Beautiful,</i> and wildly metaphoric prose that mirrors the quirks, eccentricity, and brilliance of each musician's style.</p></p><p>Besides colorful and expressive music, jazz greats such as Lester Young, Thelonius Monk and Duke Ellington led equally colorful, albeit self-destructive, lives. Through this collection of essays, Geoff Dyer recounts some of the more vivid episodes and events these personalities engaged in and illuminates unique aspects of their character that contributed to their music. He also sheds light on the oppression of working within an atmosphere of race-alienation, a hardship that led many to abuse alcohol and drugs, and find solace only in their incredible music.<p><b>Geoff Dyer</b> is the author of <i>Out of Sheer Rage: Wrestling with D.H.

That is, rule by sea power. In the undignified scholarly scramble to identify and distil the empire's early stages this truly defining characteristic is usually overlooked. Yet the Malazan expansion was undeniably one of sea power and this was the key to its early successes. It was also the key to one of its early failures: the ill-conceived incursion into the archipelago and subcontinent known variously as Fist, Korel, or the Storm-cursed. For this archipelago was itself a supreme sea power, if non-expansionist. And in the end of course it was the sea that so definitively, and with such finality, put an end to all hostilities.<i>Imperial Campaigns (The Korel Occupations)</i> Volume II, <i>Fist</i> Imrygyn TallobantDRAMATIS PERSONAEOf the Malazan Expeditionary ForceGreymane / High Fist, Commander of Expeditionary ForceOrjin SamarrMalazan 17th Squad, 4th Company, 2nd Division, Fourth ArmyOthersOf the Malazan Sixth ArmyOn the StormwallIn the Kingdom of RoolOf the Jourilan Army of ReformOf the Crimson GuardBlues Fingers Lazar ShellThe Synod of StyggTotsin Jurth the Third Brother Carfin Sister Gosh Sister Esa Sister Nebras Brother JoolIn the Shadow RealmOf the Sea-FolkCopyright � 2010 by Ian Cameron Esslemont</p><h2>Simple Act of Gratitude</h2><p>One recent December, at age 53, John Kralik found his life at a terrible, frightening low: his small law firm was failing; he was struggling through a painful second divorce; he had grown distant from his two older children and was afraid he might lose contact with his young daughter; he was living in a tiny apartment where he froze in the winter and baked in the summer; he was 40 pounds overweight; his girlfriend had just broken up with him; and overall, his dearest life dreams--including hopes of upholding idealistic legal principles and of becoming a judge--seemed to have slipped beyond his reach.<br><br> Then, during a desperate walk in the hills on New Year's Day, John was struck by the belief that his life might become at least tolerable if, instead of focusing on what he didn't have, he could find some way to be grateful for what he had.<br><br> Inspired by a beautiful, simple note his ex-girlfriend had sent to thank him for his Christmas gift, John imagined that he might find a way to feel grateful by writing thank-you notes.

Dr. Jeff Meldrum has put together a field guide on heavy-duty, waterproof card stock that literally fits in your back pocket or backpack, adding little weight to those ounce-sensitive backpackers with an interest in collecting data from the backcountry. Seemingly thinking of everything, Dr. Meldrum has even included a ruler along the top margin of the Guide so the researcher will always have a scale item for any photos taken in the woods. The Sasquatch Field Guide not only helps researchers with identifying possible spoor left by bigfoots, but it also helps him or her reduce the possibility of misidentifying signs of other animals for those of sasquatches. Also included in the Field Guide are easy-to-understand directions on how to gather and store data in the field in preparation for future analysis. The Guide uses colors and diagrams making it easy to read and understand which could be the difference between successfully gathering data and blowing it when under the pressure of dealing with the real thing out in the field. Sections in the Sasquatch Field Guide include information on visual identification, footprint identification, track casting, gathering footprint metrics, hair samples, scat samples, tree breaks, nests, cultural signs, stacked rocks, habitat and distribution, diet, vocalizations, possible origins, and taphonomy. This hefty brochure-style guide is densely-packed with valuable information that all field researchers should be intimately acquainted with.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Private Truths, Public Lies: The Social Consequences of Preference Falsification</h2><p><p>Preference falsification, according to the economist Timur Kuran, is the act of misrepresenting one's wants under perceived social pressures. It happens frequently in everyday life, such as when we tell the host of a dinner party that we are enjoying the food when we actually find it bland. In <i>Private Truths, Public Lies</i> Kuran argues convincingly that the phenomenon not only is ubiquitous but has huge social and political consequences. Drawing on diverse intellectual traditions, including those rooted in economics, psychology, sociology, and political science, Kuran provides a unified theory of how preference falsification shapes collective decisions, orients structural change, sustains social stability, distorts human knowledge, and conceals political possibilities.</p><p>A common effect of preference falsification is the preservation of widely disliked structures. Another is the conferment of an aura of stability on structures vulnerable to sudden collapse. When the support of a policy, tradition, or regime is largely contrived, a minor event may activate a bandwagon that generates massive yet unanticipated change.</p><p>In distorting public opinion, preference falsification also corrupts public discourse and, hence, human knowledge. So structures held in place by preference falsification may, if the condition lasts long enough, achieve increasingly genuine acceptance. The book demonstrates how human knowledge and social structures co-evolve in complex and imperfectly predictable ways, without any guarantee of social efficiency.</p><p><i>Private Truths, Public Lies</i> uses its theoretical argument to illuminate an array of puzzling social phenomena. They include the unexpected fall of communism, the paucity, until recently, of open opposition to affirmative action in the United States, and the durability of the beliefs that have sustained India's caste system.</p></p><p>&gt;Timur Kuran is Professor of Economics and Political Science &amp; Gorter Family Professor of Islamic Studies, Duke UniversityHow can societies experience such dramatic reversals [as the end of apartheid in South Africa, widespread smoking bans and Republican control of Congress] in such short periods? In his inventive and sometimes astonishing book, Timur Kuran offers an answer--one that bears not just on revolutionary movements, but also on feminism, conformity, cognitive dissonance, the moral majority, 'outing' homosexuals, rationality, hate speech codes, Gorbachev, hippies and the caste system (all of which make prominent appearances in these pages)...Much of the interest of Kuran's book is owed to his insistence, unusual and refreshing among economists (of whom he is one), that people's choices, and even their desires, are not given and fixed, but are a function of social and psychological conditions, above all pressures imposed by other people...Kuran's book is a terrific success. (Cass R. Sunstein <i>New Republic</i>)<br><br>A splendid book. It tackles a long list of interesting and important questions that have been discussed at length, and largely unsuccessfully, by scholars from each of the social sciences. The narrow rational choice model simply cannot answer many of these questions. Psychological theories by themselves cannot even address many of them. And sociological theories that take the group as the unit of analysis have made little progress. Kuran patiently and intelligently blends the insights of these disciplines into a behavioral model that moves the discussion forward on many fronts. (Robert H. Frank <i>Journal of Economic Literature</i>)<br><br>From the caste system of India, to communism's rise and fall, to the continuing controversy over affirmative action, Timur Kuran's new theory of social evolution is as provocative as it is ambitious. Merging insights from many disciplines, <i>Private Truths, Public Lies</i> seeks to show how 'preference falsification' shapes social action, biases knowledge, inhibits change, and (from time to time) unleashes revolution...An excellent book that can be read by scholars of all disciplines. Its interdisciplinary insights illuminate a raft of social, political, and economic phenomena. (Laurence R.

(Popular Patristics) Greek Original &amp; English Translation (Popular Patristics, 59)</h2><p>Popular Patristics Series Volume 59 St Maximus the Confessor (c. 580-662) beautifully expounds the meaning of the Divine Liturgy in On the Ecclesiastical Mystagogy, which had a profound influence on the subsequent tradition, beginning with St Germanus of Constantinople (PPS 8). Maximus&#39; vision of the liturgy contemplates the interpenetrating relationships of all things with each other and with Christ, In whom all things cohere. The church building and the human being and the cosmos are all mutually related and symbolically reflect each other. Further, In the liturgy we enter into the mystery of Christ. As St Maximus puts it, &#34;Let us not be absent from the holy Church of God because she contains such great mysteries of our salvation according to... and she reveals the gift of adoption that is given through holy baptism in the Holy Spirit and that perfects each one into the image of Christ.&#34;</p><p>Jonathan Armstrong is the assistant professor of Bible and theology at Moody Bible Institute.</p><h2>Cadillac Beach: A Novel (Serge Storms, 6)</h2><p><p>And busting out of Chattahoochee State Hospital ... without his meds! The thrill-killing Floridaphile needs to get to the bottom of his bookie grandad's bizarre 1964 death -- not to mention launch "Serge &amp; Lenny's Florida Experience," the new Miami specialty tour venture he's cooked up with his best brain-dead druggie-buddy. It's all good. For Serge A. Storms, anyway. Not so much for anyone else.</p></p><p><p>Tim Dorsey was a reporter and editor for the Tampa Tribune from 1987 to 1999, and is the author of twenty-one novels: <em>Pope of Palm Beach, Clownfish Blues, Coconut Cowboy, Shark Skin Suite, Tiger Shrimp Tango, The Riptide Ultra-Glide, When Elves Attack, Pineapple Grenade, Electric Barracuda, Gator A-Go-Go, Nuclear Jellyfish, Atomic Lobster, Hurricane Punch, The Big Bamboo, Torpedo Juice, Cadillac Beach, The Stingray Shuffle, Triggerfish Twist, Orange Crush, Hammerhead Ranch Motel</em>, and <em>Florida Roadkill</em>. He lives in Tampa, FL. </p>Certifiable nutcase Serge Storms and Lenny, his spacey marijuana-addicted sidekick, are back again in Dorsey's sixth screwball crime-spree novel (after The Stingray Shuffle), this time on the trail of a stash of missing gems. As the novel begins, Serge escapes from Chattahoochee, Florida's state psychiatric hospital, and heads for Miami, obsessed with the idea of clearing up the mystery surrounding his grandfather's alleged suicide, which is tied to the legendary dozen diamonds still missing after Murph the Surf's infamous 1964 jewel heist from the Museum of Natural History. Serge's ambitious crusade gets off to an ill-omened start when he awakens the interest of both the mob and the Feds after getting into a graveside altercation with Tony Marsicano, the mob boss who was alone at the deathbed of Rico Spagliosi, a deceased fence reputed to have a part in the jewel heist. In a typical display of off-the-wall buffoonery, Serge starts a specialty Miami tour service, and his first booking is a group of drunken salesmen who, out to play a practical joke on a colleague, mistakenly kidnap Tony, with dire results. Sporadically moving back and forth between time present and nostalgic flashbacks to Miami Beach in the 1960s, the novel chronicles the methodical murders of Serge's grandfather's old cronies as Serge tracks his grandfather's movements at the time of the infamous gem heist and the return of the most famous of the stolen stones. Studded with psychosocial observations and dopey gags, this latest episode of Florida's hottest helter-skelter, hallucinogenic freak show will delight legions of Dorsey fans. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After moving to Scotland she developed her range and sold to small shops in the area. She named the business Dormouse Designs, as one of her first creatures was a small felt mouse called Timothy. Her collectible bears are now so sought-after that Sue&#39;s work can be found in teddy bear museums in Britain, Japan and collections worldwide. Sue lives in Kilbarchan, Scotland.August 2015 Sue Quinn has designed gorgeous little felt animals for over 30 years and we can produce felt using a knitting machine! She includes clear detailed instructions, full size templates and gives away masses of trade secrets. If you've nimble fingers, add it to your wish list. * Machine Knitting Monthly * July 2015 For over thirty years Sue Quinn has designed gorgeous little felt animals that appeal to both adult collectors and children. Now she would like to share her master secrets and show that these creatures are not only playthings but something you can treasure forever. Colourful and easy to use, felt is the perfect material to make this collection of charming woodland animals. Follow the clear step-by-step instructions to create a group of endearing little creatures that you will want to make and keep. * SEWING WORLD * July 2015 Skilled and experienced bear-maker Sue, presents this collection of small woodland creatures to stitch in felt. Templates and step-by-step instructions, together with Sue's tips and hints, will ensure both beginner and the more experienced can not only create entire families of bears, rabbits, squirrels, moles or mice but their outfits and accessories too. This delightful book is excellent value for money and a must-have for all who love to sew for the young-at-heart of all ages. * East Kent Embroiderer's Guild * June 2015 Make woodland creatures out of felt and dress them. Make them posable, the subject of their own adventures and stories. Collect them, give them as gifts, use them as ornaments or playthings. All you need is felt, a bit of sewing know-how and some imagination. The author has sold her collectable felt toys all over the world, and looking at the photos it is easy to see why they are so popular. They have the polished look of simplicity but character, with their neat features and perfectly scaled clothing. There is a list at the beginning telling you what you need, with helpful captions on why this item has been chosen and what you are going to use it for. None of this is too pricey or hard to source and there is a fair bit of hand sewing with just a plain straight stitch sewing machine used at times. There is advice on basics like needle threading, how to do some simple stitches, filling, adding features and using cotter pins, so if you are new to toy making (or even pretty new to sewing) you can have a go. The rest of the book is divided into five parts for the animals and their clothing. These are bears, squirrels, mice, rabbits and moles. I like the large photo showing what each toy looks like before dressing so you can get a good look at it, and each project has plenty of staged photos with captions. Each set of creatures is engaged in a particular task, so you can make suitable clothes for gardening squirrels, rabbits going to school, bears going to bed, playful mice and moles off to market. The toys are posed with various props but instructions are not given for these - not a major problem as it is obvious what the focus of the book is. There are instructions for accessories such as bags, a blanket, toy teddy etc and suggestions for display. The only alloy in all this excellence is the fact that you require a computer and printer or photocopier in order to enlarge the patterns. A section at the back with them all full sized would have made the book larger, but more instantly accessible. Other than that this is one of the best books I have seen on making professional looking small scale toys out of felt. * Myshelf.com * June 2015 Squuueeee!! Okay I love this book! I couldn't wait to open it to see what was inside and I really wasn't disappointed! All of the techniques are explained as well as instructions how to make each of the animals and each of their outfits. You learn how to make rabbits, squirrels, bear, moles &amp; mice I love the fact that each of the animals is made into a different personality with the clothes that you make. There isn't a single one of the animals that I wouldn't want to make. They are all beautiful! This book would be a fantastic present for someone. The animals themselves would make even better presents. They are just sooo cute! The instructions are clear and easy to follow. The materials that are used are easy to purchase. Even the sewing techniques fully explained with clear and easy to follow pictures. I couldn't recommend this book highly enough! * Crochet Addict UK * June 2015 For each animal you will find a detailed colour photo of the finished animals and a brief note from the author regarding character personality, costuming and possible fabric choices. Each project starts with a material list and a copy of the pattern. The patterns are 3/4 size in the book and will need to be increased 133%. (I think the size increase is a matter of personal preference, you could make the pattern larger or smaller for miniatures or standard sized plush animals.) The author includes detailed step-by-step instructions for each part of the process. There are also descriptive colour photographs to accompany each step. The book begins with information on materials and basic techniques. These include stitches, filling and shaping, sewing features and pattern transfer. These animals are jointed with cotter joints and there are detailed instructions for installing the joint system. (I did not have any joints on hand, so I did not joint my Mole when I made him). Instructions in this book are clear and easy to follow. My favourite character in the book is the Mole, and it did not take long to make this little guy. I am more comfortable sewing by hand, so probably 80% of my project was sewn by hand. I find it easier than fighting a machine on small curves, and I do not have the masterful technique of the author when it comes to machine stitching. This book is probably best for those with some sewing experience if you are going to be installing the joints. There are some intermediate techniques for hidden seams and finishing of the facial features. Beginners should not be afraid to try making these adorable animals. The instructions are very well written and detailed. Overall, I adore this book. These animals and their outfits are really something special. * Renee Everhart * April 2015 This magazine very nearly didn't happen. Everything was going well until I received a preview of Sue Quinn's new book. I just couldn't put it down. It's a forest fiesta; a woodland wonderland... I just had to try making one of the gorgeous patterns it contains. First I wanted to make a rabbit - I have a soft spot for rabbits; but then Mrs Mole was asking me to make her too, with her beautiful pink duster coat... and who could resist the squirrel's bushy tail or the cute baby bear cuddled up with his own tiny ted... Turn just a few pages of Little Felt Animals and your fingers will be twitching to pick up the scissors, needle and thread. Each creature has a little family and every one of them can be dressed in their very own wardrobe. There are beautiful photo illustrations throughout, clear step by step instructions and, for anyone new to the art of making soft sculpture figures, easy to follow basic techniques. All the animals and quite a few accessories are make from felt or wool felt which means no frayed edges - a blessing for anyone sewing! * Teddy Bear Times * August 2015 For over thirty years Sue Quinn has designed gorgeous little felt animals that appeal to both adult collectors and children. Now she would like to share her master secrets and show these creatures are not only playthings but something you can treasure forever. Colourful and easy to use, felt is the perfect material to make this collection of charming woodland animals. Follow the clear step by step instructions to create a group of endearing little creatures that you will want to make and keep * SEWING WORLD * August 2015 Summer school is over, time to get crafty! One of my favorite craft books of 2015 came out earlier this month, How to Sew Little Felt Animals by Sue Quinn. These animals honestly look like they came out of a craft store, they are really cute and detailed, and I love their little outfits. All of the patterns for the different animals are completely separate, which makes them all look unique, and the step-by-step instructions, written and visual, will appeal to any and all beginners. * http://kickassbookreviews.blogspot.co.uk *</p><h2>Whispers in the Tall Grass</h2><p><i>Whispers in the Tall Grass</i> is the second volume of Nick Brokhausen&#x2019;s riveting memoir of his time serving in Recon Teams Habu and Crusader, CNN, part of MACV-SOG.

The enemy are using special formations to hunt recon teams and missions are now rarely accomplished without heavy contact. Despite the teams&#x2019; careful prep, losses are mounting. More and more missions are extracted by Bright Lights until eventually classic recon missions are almost impossible, and the teams briefly trial HALO insertion. Finally, as the US prepares to withdraw, the teams undertake back-to-back missions directing air strikes and disrupting supply lines to ease the pressure on the ARVN.

These early works are seen by some critics as attempting to "establish some ultimate ground for existence in the face of pain, death, doubt, and despair."

Snoopy begins to take up residence atop his doghouse, and his repertoire of impressions increases exponentially. Lucy sets up her booth and offers her first five-cent psychiatric counsel. For the very first time, Linus spends all night in the pumpkin patch on his lonely vigil for the Great Pumpkin. Charlie Brown&#39;s sister Sally makes her appearance, first as an (off-panel) brand-new baby for Charlie to gush over, then as a toddler, and eventually a talking, thinking cast member. All this, and one of the most famous Peanuts strips ever: &#34;Happiness is a warm puppy.&#34; Almost one hundred of the 731 strips collected in this volume (including many Sundays) have never been collected in any book since their original release, with one hundred more having been collected only once.The introduction is by comedienne extraordinaire Whoopi Goldberg, who reveals which Peanuts character she has tattooed on her body (and where), as well as telling of her meeting with &#34;Sparky&#34; Schulz, and her fascinating theory on Snoopy&#39;s brother Spike.</p><p>The fifth volume in Fantagraphics Books' <i>Complete Peanuts</i> series welcomes a new character: Sally, Charlie Brown's baby sister. It's interesting to see how the perpetually beleaguered CB--criticized for having a "face" face or a "failure face--now takes on the responsibility of worrying about the world his sister will grow up in. His role as manager of the baseball team continues to bring him woe, losing 600-0, losing all 20 games of the season, making a daring attempt to steal home, and having to miss a game to push his sister's stroller. Linus, at first wondering if Sally will someday go out with him, gets his answer in spades: "Isn't he the cutest thing?" But he'd much rather lavish his attention on the new teacher, Miss Othmar ("I'm very fond of the ground on which she walks"), even if his eggshell project doesn't work out as planned. Snoopy, though threatened by a hanging icicle and a possible freeway through his home, still finds joy in being a gopher, the Big Man on Campus, or the Mad Punter. "Peanuts" was well into its classic years in the 1959-60 period, with such signature moments as "Happiness is a warm puppy" and a lot of material that would become familiar staples of the Christmas and Halloween television specials. <i>--David Horiuchi</i><p><strong>Charles M. Schulz</strong> was born November 25, 1922, in Minneapolis. His destiny was foreshadowed when an uncle gave him, at the age of two days, the nickname Sparky (after the racehorse Spark Plug in the newspaper strip <em>Barney Google</em>).<br><br> In his senior year in high school, his mother noticed an ad in a local newspaper for a correspondence school, Federal Schools (later called Art Instruction Schools). Schulz passed the talent test, completed the course, and began trying, unsuccessfully, to sell gag cartoons to magazines. (His first published drawing was of his dog, Spike, and appeared in a 1937 <em>Ripley's Believe It or Not!</em> installment.) Between 1948 and 1950, he succeeded in selling 17 cartoons to the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em>&#x2015;as well as, to the local <em>St. Paul Pioneer Press</em>, a weekly comic feature called <em>Li'l Folks</em>. It was run in the women's section and paid $10 a week. After writing and drawing the feature for two years, Schulz asked for a better location in the paper or for daily exposure, as well as a raise. When he was turned down on all three counts, he quit.<br><br> He started submitting strips to the newspaper syndicates. In the spring of 1950, he received a letter from the United Feature Syndicate, announcing their interest in his submission, <em>Li'l Folks</em>. Schulz boarded a train in June for New York City; more interested in doing a strip than a panel, he also brought along the first installments of what would become <em>Peanuts</em>&#x2015;and that was what sold. (The title, which Schulz loathed to his dying day, was imposed by the syndicate.) The first <em>Peanuts</em> daily appeared October 2, 1950; the first Sunday, January 6, 1952.<br><br> Diagnosed with cancer, Schulz retired from <em>Peanuts</em> at the end of 1999. He died on February 13, 2000, the day before Valentine's Day&#x2015;and the day before his last strip was published&#x2015;having completed 17,897 daily and Sunday strips, each and every one fully written, drawn, and lettered entirely by his own hand&#x2015;an unmatched achievement in comics.</p><p><strong>Whoopi Goldberg</strong> is a household name; she&#x2019;s one of the few people to have won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and a Tony.

He graduated from Harvard in 1837, the same year he began his lifelong Journal. Inspired by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Thoreau became a key member of the Transcendentalist movement that included Margaret Fuller and Bronson Alcott. The Transcendentalists' faith in nature was tested by Thoreau between 1845 and 1847 when he lived for twenty-six months in a homemade hut at Walden Pond. While living at Walden, Thoreau worked on the two books published during his lifetime: <b><i>Walden</i></b> (1854) and <b><i>A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers</i></b> (1849). Several of his other works, including <i><b>The Maine Woods, Cape Cod</b>,</i> and <b><i>Excursions</i></b>, were published posthumously. Thoreau died in Concord, at the age of forty-four, in 1862.<br><br><b>Jeffrey S. Cramer</b>&nbsp;is the Curator of Collections at the Thoreau Institute at Walden Woods.

He lives in Maynard, Massachusetts.<p>How vain it is to sit down to write when you have not stood up to live! Methinks that the moment my legs begin to move, my thoughts begin to flow...<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;THOREAU IN HIS JOURNAL, AUGUST 19, 18511<br> &nbsp;<br> When Thoreau moved from Concord to New York in 1843, ostensibly to be the tutor for the children of Ralph Waldo Emerson&#x2019;s brother, William, he was situating himself in the center of the American publishing world. Although for various reasons, including an overwhelming sense of homesickness, he returned to Concord and remained there for the rest of his life, it is clear that at this point Thoreau was determined to be a writer. Whatever else he may have been&#x2014;social reformer, naturalist, surveyor, pencil-maker, teacher&#x2014;his work, as he would write in his journal on October 18, 1856, &#x201c;is writing, and I do not hesitate, though I know that no subject is too trivial for me, tried by ordinary standards.&#x201d;2<br> &nbsp;<br> Henry David Thoreau was born David Henry Thoreau on July 12, 1817, in Concord, and he died in Concord on May 6, 1862. During his forty-four years, or, more precisely, during the twenty-four years when he was actively writing, he wrote works that have become classics of American literature&#x2014;<i>Walden</i>, a book on deliberate and purposeful living; &#x201c;Civil Disobedience,&#x201d; a treatise on a person&#x2019;s rights and duties in relation to an unjust government; and &#x201c;Walking,&#x201d; a piece on man&#x2019;s place in Nature&#x2014;in addition to writing a two-million-word journal.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thoreau&#x2019;s success as a writer lies in the truth he utters. The questions he asks himself are the questions every individual, at his or her most attentive and sentient moments, asks. As he wrote, &#x201c;These same questions that disturb and puzzle and confound us have in their turn occurred to all the wise men; not one has been omitted; and each has answered them, according to his ability, by his words and his life.&#x201d;3 Because the answers change, however, not only from generation to generation but for each individual from year to year, his writings are works to which we return, texts constantly reflecting our own evolution.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;To read well, that is, to read true books in a true spirit,&#x201d; Thoreau wrote in the &#x201c;Reading&#x201d; chapter of&nbsp;<i>Walden</i>, &#x201c;is a noble exercise, and one that will task the reader more than any exercise which the customs of the day esteem. It requires a training such as the athletes underwent, the steady intention almost of the whole life to this object. Books must be read as deliberately and reservedly as they were written.&#x201d;4 Reading in the way Thoreau meant, you will meet with a realization that many other readers will fail to achieve, which ultimately means that a good book must not only be written by a good writer but that it must be read by a good reader.<br> &nbsp;<br> One way to be a good reader is to understand the nature of an essay. Wendell Berry defined it best in writing about Edward Abbey&#x2019;s essay &#x201c;Down the River with Henry Thoreau&#x201d;: &#x201c;It is an essay in the literal sense: a trial. Mr. Abbey tries himself against Thoreau and Thoreau against himself; he tries himself and Thoreau against the river; he tries himself and Thoreau and the river against modern times, and vice versa.&#x201d;5 This is how a reader should approach any piece by Thoreau.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thoreau gave more than seventy lectures between his first in 1838 and his last in 1860. Sometimes he found members of his audience reading the newspaper. He once overheard one person say to another, &#x201c;What does he lecture for?&#x201d;6 But some reviews of his talks indicated a man who could move his audience. A talk on &#x201c;Economy&#x201d; in 1848 caused&nbsp;<i>The Salem Observer</i>&nbsp;to write that his lecture was &#x201c;interspersed observations, speculations, and suggestions upon dress, fashions, food, dwellings, furniture, &amp;c., &amp;c., sufficiently queer to keep the audience in almost constant mirth, and sufficiently wise and new to afford many good practical hints and precepts.&#x201d;7 And&nbsp;<i>The Eastern Argus Semi-Weekly</i>&nbsp;of Portland, Maine, wrote the following year that his talk &#x201c;was unique, original, comical, and high-falutin. It kept the audience wide awake, and pleasantly excited for nearly two hours.&#x201d;8 A decade later,&nbsp;<i>The Liberator</i>&nbsp;wrote of Thoreau&#x2019;s talk on John Brown that a &#x201c;very large audience listened to this lecture, crowding the hall half an hour before the time of its commencement, and giving hearty applause to some of the most energetic expressions of the speaker.&#x201d;9<br> &nbsp;<br> Thoreau wrote in his journal on December 6, 1854: &#x201c;After lecturing twice this winter I feel that I am in danger of cheapening myself by trying to become a successful lecturer, i.e., to interest my audiences. I am disappointed to find that most that I am and value myself for is lost, or worse than lost, on my audience.&#x201d;10 The lyceum, however, served as a testing ground for much of his writing. Early versions of what would become essays or sections of his books were given as lectures, some multiple times in different locations with audiences of differing backgrounds. That much of his work was originally presented, at least in part, on the lecture circuit accounts for the directness with which Thoreau approached his readers. For Thoreau there was always an audience, not an imagined reader but a real man or woman sitting in the front row looking in&nbsp;<i>his</i>&nbsp;eyes and listening to&nbsp;<i>his</i>&nbsp;words. &#x201c;I take it for granted, when I am invited to lecture anywhere...that there is a desire to hear what&nbsp;<i>I think</i>&nbsp;on some subject, though I may be the greatest fool in the country,&#x201d; he wrote in &#x201c;Life Without Principle,&#x201d; resolving &#x201c;that I will give them a strong dose of myself. They have sent for me, and engaged to pay for me, and I am determined that they shall have me, though I bore them beyond all precedent.&#x201d;11<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I would rather write books than lectures,&#x201d;12 Thoreau confessed in his journal. &#x201c;How many a man has dated a new era in his life from the reading of a book,&#x201d; Thoreau wrote in&nbsp;<i>Walden</i>, perhaps understanding at this point the type of work he was trying to present. &#x201c;The book exists for us, perchance,&#x201d; he went on to say, &#x201c;which will explain our miracles and reveal new ones. The at present unutterable things we may find somewhere uttered.&#x201d;13 With wisdom we also learn not to do desperate things such as his neighbors, living their &#x201c;lives of quiet desperation,&#x201d;14 were doing. It was important &#x201c;so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically.&#x201d;15 It was pivotal to Thoreau&#x2019;s philosophy that action follow thought. &#x201c;What I began by reading,&#x201d; he wrote in 1841, &#x201c;I must finish by acting.&#x201d;16<br> &nbsp;<br> Although Thoreau wrote that &#x201c;the writer must to some extent inspire himself,&#x201d;17 no discussion of Thoreau can ignore the influence of Emerson. Although some tend to downplay the influence of Emerson over the young Thoreau, it is impossible to think of Thoreau without hearing echoes of Emerson. This in no way diminishes Thoreau but adds to an understanding of him. Emerson himself knew that it was &#x201c;easy to see that the debt is immense to past thought. None escapes it. The originals are not original. There is imitation, model and suggestion, to the very archangels, if we knew their history.&#x201d;18<br> &nbsp;<br> Emerson was one of the leading men of letters of his day and the center of the transcendental circle as well as a mentor and eventual friend to the younger author. That Emerson was an influence on Thoreau, and a strong one, was as it should be. That Thoreau could take that influence and adapt it without being overwhelmed by it was the key to his strength and individuality. He was a master at absorbing what had come before him and turning it uniquely into his own. Emerson wrote that a &#x201c;great man&#x201d; fills what he quotes &#x201c;with his own voice and humor, and the whole cyclopaedia of his table-talk is presently believed to be his own.&#x201d;19<br> &nbsp;<br> Emerson, in 1837, presented his oration, &#x201c;The American Scholar,&#x201d; to Thoreau&#x2019;s graduating class at Harvard. It is unclear whether Thoreau heard it at that time, but if he hadn&#x2019;t, he would certainly have read it later in its pamphlet form at the Emerson home. In this highly charged essay, Emerson wrote of the unfulfilled potential of young Americans in these words:<br> &nbsp;<br> Young men of the fairest promise, who begin life upon our shores, inflated by the mountain winds, shined upon by all the stars of God, find the earth below not in unison with these, but are hindered from action by the disgust which the principles on which business is managed inspire, and turn drudges, or die of disgust,&#x2014;some of them suicides. What is the remedy? They did not yet see, and thousands of young men as hopeful now crowding to the barriers for the career do not yet see, that if the single man plant himself indomitably on his instincts, and there abide, the huge world will come round to him. Patience,&#x2014;patience; with the shades of all the good and great for company; and for solace the perspective of your own infinite life; and for work the study and the communication of principles, the making those instincts prevalent, the conversion of the world. Is it not the chief disgrace in the world, not to be an unit;&#x2014;not to be reckoned one character;&#x2014;not to yield that peculiar fruit which each man was created to bear.... We will walk on our own feet; we will work with our own hands; we will speak our own minds.20<br> &nbsp;<br> Imagine the power of those words on a young Thoreau, on anyone, who was searching, trying to find out who he was, what he was about; imagine the power of those words as a call to arms, a clarion call, or a call like the crowing of chanticleer waking his neighbors up.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Emerson wrote in the same essay that &#x201c;the ancient precept, &#x2018;Know thyself,&#x2019; and the modern precept, &#x2018;Study nature,&#x2019; become at last one maxim,&#x201d;21 the idea was substantiated that understanding nature was parallel to understanding yourself; that through a close examination of the exterior life you could discern the interior life. Thoreau would be able to put this principle into practice, merging self-examination and the study of nature into one act.<br> &nbsp;<br> A dozen years before Thoreau&#x2019;s Walden experiment, Emerson asked in his journal, &#x201c;But would it not be cowardly to flee out of society &amp; live in the woods?&#x201d;22 Thoreau&#x2019;s move, however, was no escape but only a temporary repositioning to adjust his angle of vision. The place from which one makes an observation is critical, as when he noted that the seashore of Cape Cod formed &#x201c;neutral ground, a most advantageous point from which to contemplate this world,&#x201d;23 or when he wrote in 1852 that the &#x201c;elevated position&#x201d; afforded by climbing a mountain allowed him to &#x201c;see an infinite variety far and near in their relation to each other, thus reduced to a single picture.&#x201d;24<br> &nbsp;<br> Walden Woods was not the place a Harvard graduate usually went to live. It had been home to former slaves, Irish immigrants working on the railroad, lurkers, alcoholics, and, in 1845, Henry David Thoreau. Unlike many of the others who resided in Walden Woods for whom it was less a matter of choice than necessity, Thoreau&#x2019;s move to the woods &#x201c;to live deliberately&#x201d;25 was a matter of consideration, aspiration, and, ultimately, consequence.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thoreau&#x2019;s going to Walden Pond was in part a personal, although not necessarily a private, response to the challenges suggested to him by the utopian communities springing up in the early 1840s, and in particular the two with which some of his friends were closely associated: Fruitlands and Brook Farm. George Ripley, one of the founders of Brook Farm, explained that they were trying to prepare &#x201c;a society of liberal, intelligent, and cultivated persons, whose relations with each other would permit a more simple and wholesome life, than can be led amidst the pressure of our competitive institutions.... If wisely executed, it will be a light over this country and this age.&#x201d;26<br> &nbsp;<br> Thoreau conducted the same experiments in living as these communities, but did so on a smaller scale and from a different direction. He was not trying to re-create society by reinventing how a community should work or by imposing a new constitution upon a self-created communal association, as Brook Farm had done. This was not the way society would be renewed. The failure of these and other similar efforts to fundamentally change the way people lived showed that Thoreau was correct in searching for another method to reform human culture.<br> &nbsp;<br> At Walden Pond Thoreau could question the individual&#x2019;s role and obligations, not only to society but to himself: how should he live, how should he interact with his neighbors, how should he obligate himself to the laws, not only of the society within which he lived, but to those laws that were higher than those of the land: moral or religious principles, or laws of conscience, that take precedence over the constitutions or statutes of society. These questions were paramount.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thoreau wrote in his journal, and repeated in his first book,&nbsp;<i>A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers</i>, that autobiography is preferable to biography: &#x201c;If I am not I, who will be?&#x201d;27 Or again, in his journal: &#x201c;Is not the poet bound to write his own biography?

This is an authoritative, practice-orientated elucidation of a foundational Buddhist text, useful to meditators whatever their tradition or background. <br><br>In the first six chapters An&#x101;layo presents practical instructions comparable to his Satipatth&#x101;na Meditation: A Practice Guide. The remaining chapters contain his translations of extracts from the early Chinese canon.

His aim is to inspire all practitioners to use what he has found helpful to build their own practice and become self-reliant. <br><br>The book is accompanied with freely downloadable audio files offering guided and progressive meditation instructions from the author.</p><p>Bhikkhu Analayo is a faculty member at the Barre Center for Buddhist Studies and a professor at the Numata Center for Buddhist Studies at the University of Hamburg. His main area of academic research is early Buddhism, with a special interest in the topics of meditation and women in Buddhism. At the Barre Center for Buddhist Studies he regularly teaches residential study and practice courses, participates in online programs and undertakes research into meditation-related themes. He completed a PhD on the Satipatthana-sutta at the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka, in 2000, published in 2003, by Windhorse Publications under the title Satipatthana: The Direct Path to Realization.Introduction In this book I explore the practice of mindfulness of breathing in detail and from a predominantly practice-orientated perspective. In other monograph publications on satipatthana meditation, I have already had the opportunity to study aspects of mindfulness of breathing (Analayo 2003b: 125-136, 2013b: 227- 237, 2016b: 242-249, 2017e: 63-66, and 2018c: 90-95). Nevertheless, the practice of mindfulness of breathing in sixteen steps is of such eminent potential that it deserves a study of its own. <br>The first six chapters present practical instructions comparable to my practice guide on satipatthana (Analayo 2018c). As was the case with that earlier practice guide, here as well my presentation is not meant to imply that mindfulness of breathing in ancient India was undertaken exactly in the way which I describe in the following pages. I also do not mean to pretend that my approach is the only viable way of putting into practice the instructions found in the Anapanasati-sutta. My aim is decidedly not to compete with others, but only to enrich. What I am putting out here is done in the spirit of open-source. I present my understanding of the discourse, as the result of my own practice and teaching experience, in the hope of inspiring others to use what they find helpful to build their own practice and become self-reliant. The book comes with audio files that offer meditation instructions, which can be freely downloaded from the publisher's website at https://www.windhorsepublications.com . For each of the six chapters in this book there are audio recordings with guided meditation instructions that build on each other gradually.<br>In the first six chapters I dispense with footnotes, as well as with references to studies by others. I use in-line quotation to refer to relevant passages from the Pali discourses and to provide cross-references to relevant material in the final four chapters which provide a more scholarly perspective as a backup for the preceding six chapters. In the final four chapters I translate extracts from the Chinese Agamas that in one way or another appear to me to be of relevance for appreciating the early Buddhist perspective on the breath and the practice of mindfulness of breathing. The translations come with selected comments from a comparative perspective and attempts to interpret the relevant passage from a practice-related angle. <br>In 1990 I had the great fortune to meet Ajahn Buddhad?sa and sit a retreat on mindfulness of breathing at his monastery Suan Mokkh in Thailand. This has set a firm foundation for my explorations of this practice in the intervening years up to now. In the meantime, my approach to mindfulness of breathing has evolved considerably, so that I cannot claim the venerable Ajahn's authority for anything that I present here. However, if what I describe here should be of use to the reader, then this must be due to the foundation laid back in 1990.<br><br>Mindfulness and the Breath<br>As part of an illustration of the practice mindfulness of breathing with the example of a condor, the preliminaries discussed in this chapter correspond to the condor getting up high into the air.<br>In this chapter I discuss the introductory practice which in the Anapanasati-sutta (MN 118) precedes the actual instructions for mindfulness of breathing in sixteen steps. Besides trying to draw out implications of this description by reference to other discourse passages and pertinent later works, my intention in what follows is also to present a practice-oriented approach to the indications made in this introductory passage. The progression through the sixteen steps being a rather profound and sophisticated form of practice, by way of preparation I take up the preliminaries to these sixteen steps in considerable detail and endeavour to bring in additional perspectives that go beyond what is implied in the actual instructions. In this way I hope to make sure that the needed foundation for proceeding smoothly through the sixteen steps of mindfulness of breathing is in place. The relevant part of the ?n?p?nasati-sutta on these preliminaries proceeds as follows: <br>Here gone to a forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut, one sits down; having folded the legs crosswise, keeping the body erect, and having established mindfulness in front, mindful one breathes in and mindful one breathes out.<br>The above instruction gradually proceeds from the external to the internal. First comes withdrawal to a place that affords seclusion, next a description of the posture of sitting down with folded legs, combined with need to keep the seated body erect, and then the establishing of mindfulness. Central topics in this instruction are thus "seclusion" as the appropriate external setting for cultivating mindfulness of breathing, "the posture" to be adopted for such practice, and how to "establish mindfulness" in front. In what follows I examine each of these topics in turn.<br>SECLUSION<br>The first part of the above description mentions a forest, the root of a tree, and an empty hut as commendable places for the practice of mindfulness of breathing. Other discourses relate the three places of a forest, the root of a tree, and an empty hut to other meditation practices, making it clear that this description is not confined to mindfulness of breathing (An?layo 2003b: 127n39). <br>In the ancient Indian setting, meditation would have regularly been done out in nature. Hence a forest or the root of a tree naturally commend themselves. They provide shelter from the sun as well as from rain, and at the same time afford seclusion from the hustle and bustle of villages or towns. With an empty hut situated in a secluded environment such protection becomes more thorough, as in addition to coverage from sun or rain provided by the leaves of a single tree or a forest, it also affording protection from being disturbed by various other living beings</p><h2>Fire and Ice: A Novel (Buchanan-Renard)</h2><p><p>Sophie Rose is a crime reporter at a major Chicago newspaper and the daughter of Bobby Rose, a charming gentleman and big-time thief.

The biggest damned polar bear anyone had ever seen in or around Prudhoe Bay in the last twenty-five years, or so it was reported.<br><br>Arrogance got him killed, though, and if William Emmett Harrington hadn&#x2019;t been such a narcissist, he might still be alive. But he was a narcissist, and he was also a braggart.<br><br>The only topic of conversation William was interested in was William, and since he hadn&#x2019;t accomplished much of anything significant in his twenty-eight years on earth, he was painfully boring.<br><br>William lived off his inheritance, a hefty trust fund set up by his grandfather, Henry Emmett Harrington, who must have had an inkling of the lazy-ass gene he was passing down, because his son, Morris Emmett Harrington, didn&#x2019;t work a day in his life. And Wil?liam happily followed in his father&#x2019;s footsteps.<br><br>Like all the Harrington men before him, William was a handsome devil and knew it. He didn&#x2019;t have any trouble getting women into his bed, but he could never lure any of them back for a repeat performance. No wonder. William treated sex like a race he had to win in order to prove that he was the best, and because he really was a narcissist, he didn&#x2019;t care about satisfying his partner. What he wanted was all that mattered.<br><br>His past conquests had come up with various nicknames for him. Pig was one. Quick Trip was another. But the one that was uttered most behind his back was The Minute Man. All the women who had gone to bed with him knew exactly what that meant.<br><br>Besides self-gratification, William&#x2019;s other passion was running. He&#x2019;d made it a full-time job because, as with sex, he was shockingly fast. In the past year he had accumulated twenty-four first-place prizes within a six-state area, and he was about to enter a 5K race in his hometown of Chicago to collect his twenty-fifth. Since he believed crossing the finish line first was going to be a momentous event that everyone in Chicago would want to read about, he called the Chicago Tribune and suggested they do a feature article about him in the Sunday paper. Harrington also mentioned more than once how photogenic he was and how a full-color photo of him would enhance the article.<br><br>One of the local news editors at the Tribune took the call and ?patiently listened to William&#x2019;s pitch, then bounced him to one of the entertainment editors, who quickly bounced him to one of the sports columnists, who bounced him to one of the health and fitness editors, who wrote an entire article on the top-five allergens plaguing Chicago while he listened to the spiel. None of them was impressed or interested. The last editor to speak to William suggested that he give him a call back when he had ninety-nine wins under his belt and was going for one hundred.<br><br>William wasn&#x2019;t discouraged. He immediately called the Chicago Sun Times and explained his idea for a story. He was rejected yet again.<br><br>William realized he was going to have to lower his expectations if he wanted to see his name in print, and so he contacted the Illinois Chronicle, a small but popular neighborhood newspaper that focused primarily on local issues and entertainment.<br><br>The editor in chief, Herman Anthony Bitterman, was an antacid-popping seasoned veteran of the press with a pronounced Brooklyn accent. For thirty years he had been on the foreign desk of The New York Times and had garnered several prestigious honors including the RFK Journalism Award and the Polk Award, but when his good-for-nothing son-in-law ran off with another woman&#x2014;his daughter&#x2019;s yoga instructor, for the love of God&#x2014;Herman retired from the Times and moved with his wife, Marissa, to Chicago where she had grown up and where their daughter now lived with her four little girls.<br><br>A newsman at heart, Herman couldn&#x2019;t stay retired long. When the opportunity presented itself, he took the job at the Chronicle as a distraction from boredom and an escape from the horde of meddling in-laws.<br><br>He liked Chicago. He&#x2019;d gone to Northwestern University, where he&#x2019;d met Marissa. After graduation, they had returned to his hometown, New York, so he could take a job at the Times. Coming back to Chicago after decades in New York was a real adjustment. He had lived in a cramped two-bedroom Manhattan apartment for so long that a two-story brownstone took some getting used to. His only real complaint was the lack of noise. He missed falling asleep to the soothing sounds of cars screeching, horns blaring, and sirens shrieking.<br><br>With so much quiet, even at the office, Herman found it difficult to get any work done. To compensate, he brought in an old television set from home, plopped it on top of his mini refrigerator, and left it on all day with the volume turned up.<br><br>When the call came in from William Harrington, Herman hit the mute button before picking up the phone. While he ate his lunch&#x2014;an Italian sausage and green pepper sandwich drenched in ketchup and washed down with an icy cold Kelly&#x2019;s Root Beer&#x2014;he listened to Harrington pitch his story idea.<br><br>It took Bitterman all of half a minute to sum up William Harrington. The man was an egomaniac.<br><br>&#x201c;Red, huh? You always wear red socks and a red T-shirt for every race. And white shorts. Yeah, that&#x2019;s interesting. Even when you run in the winter? Still wear the shorts?&#x201d;<br><br>His question encouraged Harrington to ramble more, allowing Bitterman time to finish his sandwich. He took a long swig of his root beer, then interrupted Harrington&#x2019;s grandiose opinion of himself and said, &#x201c;Yeah, sure. We&#x2019;ll do the story. Why not?&#x201d;<br><br>After scribbling down the particulars, Bitterman disconnected the call, then wadded up his brown lunch sack and tossed it into the trash can.<br><br>He crossed the office to get to the door&#x2014;a no small feat considering nearly every inch of the room was filled with crates of Kelly&#x2019;s Old-Fashioned Root Beer stacked halfway to the ceiling. Since his door wasn&#x2019;t blocked, his office hadn&#x2019;t been deemed a fire hazard, at least not yet. He was hoarding what was left of Kelly&#x2019;s Root Beer because, in his estimation, it was the best damned root beer he had ever tasted, and when he&#x2019;d heard the company had been forced to close its doors and was going out of business, he had done what any root beer addict would do and rushed out to buy as many bottles of the stuff as he could get his hands on.<br><br>&#x201c;Blond Girl!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got another story for you. This one&#x2019;s a humdinger.&#x201d;<br><br>Sophie Summerfield Rose tried to ignore Bitterman&#x2019;s bellow as she put the finishing touches on an article she was about to e-mail him.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Sophie, I think Bitterman&#x2019;s calling you.&#x201d;<br><br>Gary Warner, a brute of a man and the office snitch, leaned over her cubicle. His smile reminded Sophie of a cartoon fox with his teeth bared. He looked a bit like a fox, too. His nose was long and pointy, and his complexion was as dull as his long straggly hair. Mullets had never really been in style, but Gary loved his and used so much hair spray on it, it looked starched.<br><br>&#x201c;Since you&#x2019;re the only female here today and since you&#x2019;re the only blonde in the entire office, I&#x2019;m pretty sure &#x2018;Blond Girl&#x2019; means you.&#x201d; He had a good laugh over what he considered a hilarious observation.<br><br>Sophie didn&#x2019;t respond. No matter how obnoxious Gary became, and he had cornered the market on obnoxious a long time ago, she refused to let him rile her. She carefully pushed her chair back so she wouldn&#x2019;t hit the file cabinet again. It already had so many dents, it looked like someone had taken a baseball bat to it.<br><br>The Chronicle was housed in an old warehouse. It was a huge, gray stone building with gray cement floors, gray brick walls, and a dingy gray ceiling that Sophie suspected had once been white. The fluorescent lighting was nearly as old as the building. The presses were in the basement. Circulation and the other departments were on the first floor, and the editorial offices were on the second floor. It was a huge space, yet each gray-paneled cubicle, including hers, was the size of a refrigerator. A side-by-side, but still a refrigerator.<br><br>The Chronicle could have been a depressing place to work, but it wasn&#x2019;t. Colorful posters hung above the gray file cabinets that lined the far wall, and each cubicle was brightly decorated. Some were more creative than others, but each gave a hint of the occupant&#x2019;s personality.<br><br>Gary&#x2019;s cubicle was decorated with half-eaten sandwiches and pastries, some at least a week old. He wouldn&#x2019;t let the cleaning crew touch his desk, and Sophie didn&#x2019;t think it had ever been cleared of the clutter. She wouldn&#x2019;t have been surprised to find roaches skittering under all the garbage, but Gary probably wouldn&#x2019;t have minded. He was most likely related to some of them.<br><br>Still hanging over her cubicle wall, his frame was so large she thought he might just snap the panels. When Sophie stood, Gary was entirely too close, his rancid aftershave overwhelming.<br><br>So that he couldn&#x2019;t snoop while she was in Bitterman&#x2019;s office, Sophie turned her computer off and made sure he saw her do it. She wasn&#x2019;t being paranoid. Just last week she had caught him sitting at her desk trying to get around her password to access her e-mail. He had already rifled through her desk. Two drawers were open, and he hadn&#x2019;t bothered to put the stack of papers back where she had left them. When she demanded to know what he was doing at her desk, he stammered lamely about his computer being down and how he was checking to see if hers was down, too.<br><br>Bitterman roared again, and Sophie, feeling somewhat like a mouse navigating a maze, hurriedly zigzagged her way around the cubicles to reach his office at the end of the long room. She pictured a piece of yellow cheese dangling from a string in front of her boss&#x2019;s door. Wasn&#x2019;t that the reward for the little mouse at the end of the maze?<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Sophie, heard from your father lately?&#x201d; Gary shouted from behind.<br><br>He had asked her that same question about ten minutes after she had started working at the Chronicle, which was probably why she had taken such a quick dislike to him. Not only was Gary a snoop, but at times he could be downright antagonistic. Usually, people skirted around the subject of her dad, Bobby Rose, when they first met Sophie, but not Gary. She had just started writing her first ?article when Gary had called over the cubicle wall, &#x201c;Hey, Sophie Rose . . . oops, it&#x2019;s Sophie Summerfield, isn&#x2019;t it? I forgot, you&#x2019;re not using your daddy&#x2019;s name. Guess you don&#x2019;t want the world to know who you are, huh? I wouldn&#x2019;t either if my old man was a crook. Who&#x2019;s he scammed lately? Heard he&#x2019;s made off with a butt-load of money. If you ever see him again, tell him ol&#x2019; Gary could sure use a loan. Tell him a couple of million would do just fine. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>She hadn&#x2019;t answered him then or the hundred or so other times he&#x2019;d asked about her father, and she wasn&#x2019;t about to answer him now.<br><br>Gary wasn&#x2019;t the only one interested in finding her father. She received regular visits from the FBI, the IRS, the CIA, and just about every other government agency with initials. All of them wanted to know where Bobby Rose was; all of them wanted a pound of his flesh.<br><br>She heard Gary call out his question again, but she continued to ignore him as she rounded the last cubicle and reached Bitterman&#x2019;s office.</p><h2>Isard&#39;s Revenge (Star Wars, X-Wing #8)</h2><p>Sleek, swift and deadly, the famed X-Wing fighters have earned their reputation as the Rebel Alliance's ultimate strike force the hard way--first in battle, the last line of defense.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they must make a deal with the devil herself--an enemy whose ultimate goal is their total annihilation.<br><br>It's the kind of mission only Wedge Antilles and the Rogue Squadron would dare to undertake.&nbsp;&nbsp;Against impossible odds they will stage a daring raid into an enemy stronghold--only to be rescued from certain destruction by an unexpected ally.<br><br>Ysanne Isard, the ruthless Imperial commander, has appeared on the scene seemingly from out of nowhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now she proposes a most unusual alliance, offering to help Wedge rescue his captured comrades from Imperial Warlord Admiral Krennel's sadistic prison camp.<br><br>But her offer is not without a price.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wedge must lead Rogue Squadron in Isard's deadly struggle against an enemy made in her own image.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's an offer Wedge would love to refuse, for Isard is certain to betray them.&nbsp;&nbsp;But how can they leave their comrades at Krennel's mercy?&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is: they can't--even if it means being caught between Krennel's ruthlessness and Isard's treachery.</p><p>Michael A.

Wedge Antilles has transferred back from Wraith to Rogue Squadron, and many of the characters from Stackpole's first four books reappear, including Ysanne Isard, the villain of Book 4, <i>The Bacta War</i>.<p> Now that Grand Admiral Thrawn is dead, the New Republic wants to go after the warlords and decides to make an example of Krennel, who murdered a whole family in his rise to power. But Krennel has an unexpected ally: the treacherous Isard, whom the Rogues thought they had killed, is now plotting their downfall. She uses New Republic prisoners, with whom Rogue pilot Corran Horn was held for a while, as bait. The plot twists and turns, sometimes confusingly, as Krennel, Isard, and the Rogues try to outguess one another.</p><p> As ever in the X-Wing books, there are plenty of space battles, with Wedge Antilles, now promoted to general, leading the way. Meanwhile, the aversion Imperials feel toward nonhumans and the tensions between the various species making up the New Republic provide a couple of subplots that make this a thoughtful, action-packed installment in the series. <i>--Liz Sourbut, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><b>Michael A.

It took him from the colossal supermarkets of California to India&#x2019;s wrecked paddy-fields and Africa&#x2019;s bankrupt coffee farms, while along the way he ate genetically engineered soy beans and dodged flying objects in the protestor-packed streets of South Korea.<br><br> What he found was shocking, from the false choices given us by supermarkets to a global epidemic of farmer suicides, and real reasons for famine in Asia and Africa.<br><br> Yet he also found great cause for hope&#x2014;in international resistance movements working to create a more democratic, sustainable and joyful food system. Going beyond ethical consumerism, Patel explains, from seed to store to plate, the steps to regain control of the global food economy, stop the exploitation of both farmers and consumers, and rebalance global sustenance.</p><p><b>Raj Patel, </b>a fellow at Food First, is a visiting scholar at the UC Berkeley Center for African Studies.

He is the author of <i>The Value of Nothing: How to Reshape Market Society and Redefine Democracy.</i><p>Today, when we produce more food than ever before, more than one in ten people on Earth are hungry. The hunger of 800 million happens at the same time as another historical first: that they are outnumbered by the one billion people on this planet who are overweight. Global hunger and obesity are symptoms of the same problem and, what&#x2019;s more, the route to eradicating world hunger is also the way to prevent global epidemics of diabetes and heart disease, and to address a host of environmental and social ills. Overweight and hungry people are linked through the chains of production that bring food from fields to our plate. Guided by the profit motive, the corporations that sell our food shape and constrain how we eat, and how we think about food. The limitations are clearest at the fast food outlet, where the spectrum of choice runs from McMuffin to McNugget. But there are hidden and systemic constraints even when we feel we&#x2019;re beyond the purview of Ronald McDonald.<br><br> Even when we want to buy something healthy, something to keep the doctor away, we&#x2019;re trapped in the very same system that has created our &#x2018;Fast Food Nations&#x2019;. Try, for example, shopping for apples. At supermarkets in North America and Europe, the choice is restricted to half a dozen varieties: Fuji, Braeburn, Granny Smith, Golden Delicious and perhaps a couple of others. Why these? Because they&#x2019;re pretty: we like the polished and unblemished skin.&nbsp;Because their taste is one that&#x2019;s largely unobjectionable to the majority. But also because they can stand transportation over long distances. Their skin won&#x2019;t tear or blemish if they&#x2019;re knocked about in the miles from orchard to aisle. They take well to the waxing technologies and compounds that make this transportation possible and keep the apples pretty on the shelves. They are easy to harvest. They respond well to pesticides and industrial production. These are reasons why we won&#x2019;t find Calville Blanc, Black Oxford, Zabergau Reinette, Kandil Sinap or the ancient and venerable Rambo on the shelves. Our choices are not entirely our own because, even in a supermarket, the menu is crafted not by our choices, nor by the seasons, nor where we find ourselves, nor by the full range of apples available, nor by the full spectrum of available nutrition and tastes, but by the power of food corporations.<br><br> The concerns of food production companies have ramifications far beyond what appears on supermarket shelves. Their concerns are the rot at the core of the modern food system. To show the systemic ability of a few to impact the health of the many demands a global investigation, travelling from the &#x2018;green deserts&#x2019; of Brazil to the architecture of the modern city, and moving through history from the time of the first domesticated plants to the Battle of Seattle. It&#x2019;s an enquiry that uncovers the real reasons for famine in Asia and Africa, why there is a worldwide epidemic of farmer suicides, why we don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s in our food any more, why black people in the United States are more likely to be overweight than white, why there are cowboys in South Central Los Angeles, and how the world&#x2019;s largest social movement is discovering ways, large and small, for us to think about, and live differently with, food.<br><br> The alternative to eating the way we do today promises to solve hunger and diet-related disease, by offering a way of eating and growing food that is environmentally sustainable and socially just. Understanding the ills of the way food is grown and eaten also offers&nbsp;the key to greater freedom, and a way of reclaiming the joy of eating. The task is as urgent as the prize is great.&nbsp;In every country, the contradictions of obesity, hunger, poverty and wealth are becoming more acute. India has, for example, destroyed millions of tons of grains, permitting food to rot in silos, while the quality of food eaten by India&#x2019;s poorest is getting worse for the first time since Independence in 1947. In 1992, in the same towns and villages where malnutrition had begun to grip the poorest families, the Indian government admitted foreign soft drinks manufacturers and food multinationals to its previously protected economy. Within a decade, India has become home to the world&#x2019;s largest concentration of diabetics: people &#x2013; often children &#x2013; whose bodies have fractured under the pressure of eating too much of the wrong kinds of food.&nbsp;India isn&#x2019;t the only home to these contrasts. They&#x2019;re global, and they&#x2019;re present even in the world&#x2019;s richest country. In the United States in 2005, 35.1 million people didn&#x2019;t know where their next meal was coming from. At the same time there is more diet-related disease like diabetes, and more food, in the US than ever before.<br><br> It&#x2019;s easy to become inured to this contradiction; its daily version causes only mild discomfort, walking past the &#x2018;homeless and hungry&#x2019; signs on the way to supermarkets bursting with food. There are moral emollients to balm a troubled conscience: the poor are hungry because they&#x2019;re lazy, or perhaps the wealthy are fat because they eat too richly. This vein of folk wisdom has a long pedigree. Every culture has had, in some form or other, an understanding of our bodies as public ledgers on which is written the catalogue of our private vices. The language of condemnation doesn&#x2019;t, however, help us understand why hunger, abundance and obesity are more compatible on our planet than they&#x2019;ve ever been.&nbsp;Moral condemnation only works if the condemned could have done things differently, if they had choices. Yet the prevalence of hunger and obesity affect populations with far too much&nbsp;regularity, in too many different places, for it to be the result of some personal failing. Part of the reason our judgement is so out of kilter is because the way we read bodies hasn&#x2019;t kept up with the times. Although it may once have been true, the assumption that to be overweight is to be rich no longer holds. Obesity can no longer be explained exclusively as a curse of individual aff luence. There are systemic features that make a difference. Here&#x2019;s an example: many teenagers in Mexico, a developing country with an average income of US$6,000, are bloated as never before, even as the ranks of the Mexican poor swell. Individual wealth doesn&#x2019;t explain why the children of some families are more obese than others: the crucial factor turns out not to be income, but proximity to the US border. The closer a Mexican family lives to its northern neighbours and to their sugar- and fat-rich processed food habits, the more overweight the family&#x2019;s children are likely to be.2 That geography matters so much rather overturns the idea that personal choice is the key to preventing obesity or, by the same token, preventing hunger. And it helps to renew the lament of Porfirio Diaz, one of Mexico&#x2019;s late-nineteenth-century presidents and autocrats: &#x2018;�Pobre Mexico! Tan lejos de Dios; y tan cerca de los Estados Unidos&#x2019; (Poor Mexico: so far from God, so close to the United States).<br><br> A perversity of the way our food comes to us is that it&#x2019;s now possible for people who can&#x2019;t afford enough to eat to be obese. Children growing up malnourished in the favelas of S�o Paulo, for instance, are at greater risk from obesity when they become adults. Their bodies, broken by childhood poverty, metabolize and store food poorly. As a result, they&#x2019;re at greater risk of storing as fat the (poor-quality) food that they can access.3 Across the planet, the poor can&#x2019;t afford to eat well. Again, this is true even in the world&#x2019;s richest country; and in the US, it&#x2019;s children who will pay the price. One research team recently suggested that if consumption patterns stay the way they are, today&#x2019;s US children will live five fewer years,&nbsp;because of the diet-related diseases to which they will be exposed in their lifetimes.<br><br> As consumers, we&#x2019;re encouraged to think that an economic system based on individual choice will save us from the collective ills of hunger and obesity. Yet it is precisely &#x2018;freedom of choice&#x2019; that has incubated these ills. Those of us able to head to the supermarket can boggle at the possibility of choosing from fifty brands of sugared cereals, from half a dozen kinds of milk that all taste like chalk, from shelves of bread so sopped in chemicals that they will never go off, from aisles of products in which the principal ingredient is sugar. British children are, for instance, able to select from twenty-eight branded breakfast cereals the marketing of which is aimed directly at them. The sugar content of twenty-seven of these exceeds the government&#x2019;s recommendations. Nine of these children&#x2019;s cereals are&nbsp;40 per cent sugar. It&#x2019;s hardly surprising, then, that 8.5 per cent of six-year-olds and more than one in ten fifteen-year-olds in the UK are obese. And the levels are increasing. The breakfast cereal story is a sign of a wider systemic feature: there&#x2019;s every incentive for food producing corporations to sell food that has undergone processing which renders it more profitable, if less nutritious. Incidentally, this explains why there are so many more varieties of breakfast cereals on sale than varieties of apples.<br><br> There are natural limits to our choices. There are, for instance, only so many naturally occurring fruits, vegetables and animals that people are prepared to eat. But even here, a little advertising can persuade us to expand the ambit of our choices. Think of the kiwi fruit, once known as the Chinese gooseberry, but rebranded to accommodate Cold War prejudices by the New Zealand food company that marketed it to the world at the end of the 1950s. It&#x2019;s a taste no-one had grown up with, but which now seems as if it has always been there. And while new natural foods are slowly added to our menus, the food industry adds tens of thousands of new products to the shelves every year, some of which become&nbsp;indispensable fixtures which, after a generation, make life unimaginable without them. It&#x2019;s a sign of how limited our gastronomic imaginations can be. And also a sign that we&#x2019;re not altogether sure how or where or why certain foods end up on our plate.</p></p><h2>How Philosophy Works: The Concepts Visually Explained (DK How Stuff Works)</h2><p><b>What is the meaning of life?

As in her previous novels, Mones&#x2019;s captivating story also brings into focus a changing China -- this time the hidden world of high culinary culture.<br><br>When Maggie McElroy, a widowed American food writer, learns of a Chinese paternity claim against her late husband&#x2019;s estate, she has to go immediately to Beijing. She asks her magazine for time off, but her editor counters with an assignment: to profile the rising culinary star Sam Liang.<br><br>In China Maggie unties the knots of her husband&#x2019;s past, finding out more than she expected about him and about herself. With Sam as her guide, she is also drawn deep into a world of food rooted in centuries of history and philosophy. To her surprise she begins to be transformed by the cuisine, by Sam&#x2019;s family -- a querulous but loving pack of cooks and diners -- and most of all by Sam himself. The Last Chinese Chef is the exhilarating story of a woman regaining her soul in the most unexpected of places.</p><p>Nicole Mones has mined the endless riches of China once again in <i>The Last Chinese Chef</i>. This time she hits the trifecta: the personal stories of Sam and Maggie, the history and lore of Chinese cuisine, and an inside look at cultural dislocation. Maggie McElroy is a widowed American food writer who is suddenly confronted with a paternity claim against her late husband's estate--by a Chinese family. Her editor offers her another reason to go to Beijing: write an article about a rising young Chinese-American-Jewish chef, Sam Liang. Having sold the home she had with her late husband Matt and reduced her possessions to only the barest necessities, with her life feeling as though it is contracting around her, Maggie embraces the oppportunity to sort out her feelings about Matt's supposed infidelity and do some work at the same time. <p> She and Sam hit it off right away, even though he is involved in a very important competition for a place on the Chinese national cooking team for the 2008 Olympics. They travel together to the south of China where she meets her husband's possible daughter--with Sam standing by to act as translator--and where Maggie meets much of Sam's family. He has been welcomed back with open arms, even though he occasionally feels that he has one foot in China and one in Ohio. The Beijing uncles and the Hangzhou uncle are a raucous, loving, argumentative bunch of foodies who advise Sam about menus, encourage a romance with Maggie, make him start over again when the dish isn't perfect, and alternately praise and criticize his cooking. </p><p> Maggie loves being in the middle of it all and finds herself more and more drawn to Sam. She begins, with Sam's help, to see food as "healing" and understands the guanxi or "connectedness" that takes place around food. At the beginning of each chapter is a paragraph taken from a book entitled <i>The Last Chinese Chef</i>, written by Sam's grandfather and translated by Sam and his father. Mones has written that book, too, which is an explanation of the place of food in Chinese history and family life. The novel is rich with meaning and lore and an examination of loving relationships. Don't even touch this book when you're hungry. The descriptions make the aromas and textures float right off the page. --<i>Valerie Ryan</i></p><p>Nicole Mones is the prizewinning author of three previous novels, <i>The Last Chinese Chef</i>, <i>Lost in Translation</i>, and <i>A Cup of Light</i>, which are published in more than twenty-five countries.</p></p><h2>The Soul&#39;s Upward Yearning: Clues to Our Transcendent Nature from Experience and Reason (Happiness, Suffering, and Transcendence) (Volume 2)</h2><p><p></p><p>Since the early twentieth century, scientific materialism has so undermined our belief in the human capacity for transcendence that many people find it difficult to believe in God and the human soul. The materialist perspective has not only cast its spell on the natural sciences, psychology, philosophy, and literature, it has also enthralled popular culture, which offers very little to encourage the &#x201c;soul&#x2019;s upward yearning&#x201d;.</p><p></p><p></p><p>There are many signs of the widespread loss of confidence in our ability to soar upward, and these have been noted by thinkers as diverse as Carl Jung (psychiatrist), Mircea Eliade (historian of religion), Gabriel Marcel (philosopher), and authors C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien. Their observations were validated by a 2004 study published in the American Journal of Psychiatry that linked the absence of religion with a marked increase in suicide, meaninglessness, substance abuse, separation from family members, and other psychological problems.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Thus, the loss of transcendence is negatively affecting an entire society. It is stealing from countless individuals their sense of happiness, dignity, ideals, virtues, and destiny.Ironically, the evidence for transcendence is greater today than in any other period in history. The problem is, this evidence has not been compiled and made widely available&#x2014;a challenge Father Spitzer aspires to meet with this book.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Father Spitzer&#x2019;s work provides a bright light in the midst of the darkness by presenting traditional and contemporary evidence for God and a transphysical soul from several major sources. It shows that we are transcendent beings with souls capable of surviving bodily death; that we are self-reflective beings aware of and able to strive toward perfect truth, love, goodness, and beauty; that we have the dignity of being created in the very image of God. If we underestimate these truths, we undervalue one another, underlive our lives, and underachieve our destiny.&nbsp;</p><p></p></p><p><p><b>Robert Spitzer, S.J., Ph.D.</b>, is the former president of Gonzaga University.

The product of that plan was the first great empirical book on the Negro in American society. William Edward Burghardt DuBois (1868-1963), Ph.D. from Harvard (class of 1890), was given a temporary post as Assistant in Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania in order to conduct in-depth studies on the Negro community in Philadelphia. The provost of the university was interested and sympathetic, but DuBois knew early on that white interest and sympathy were far from enough. He knew that scholarship was itself a great weapon in the Negro&#39;s struggle for a decent life. The Philadelphia Negro was originally published by the University of Pennsylvania Press in 1899. One of the first works to combine the use of urban ethnography, social history, and descriptive statistics, it has become a classic work in the social science literature. Both the issues the book raises and the evolution of DuBois&#39;s own thinking about the problems of black integration into American society sound strikingly contemporary. Among the intriguing aspects of The Philadelphia Negro are what it says about the author, about race in urban America and about social science at the time, but even more important is the fact that many of DuBois&#39;s observations can be made - in fact are being made - by investigators today. In his introduction to this edition, Elijah Anderson traces DuBois&#39;s life before his move to Philadelphia. He then examines how the neighborhood studied by DuBois has changed over the years, and he compares thestatus of blacks today with their status when the book was initially published.Elijah Anderson is Charles and William L.

She and her husband, Bill, coauthor a series of Victorian-Edwardian mysteries under the name Robin Paige, which includes such titles as <i>Death at Glamis Castle </i>and <i>Death at Whitechapel</i>.In this promising though conventional debut mystery, Albert (Work of Her Oum) ably invents a central Texas town called Pecan Springs. While the plotting is somewhat mundane, the book's appealing late-summer setting and descriptions of home cooking are nicely evocative. Narrator China Bayels, 42, a former fast-track Houston attorney who now owns a slowlane Pecan Springs herb emporium, erdoys her laid-back lifestyle until the untimely death of her friend Jo Gilbert. Jo, who was battling cancer, is found after she downed a bottle of sleeping pills with vodka, but some in the closeknit community insist that suicide wasn't Jo's style. China and her brassy, New-Agey pal Ruby snoop around and learn that Jo once had an affair with another woman, a prominent childrens'-TV personality. Did the famous lover fear that gossip might ruin her career? Suspicion in Jo's death-and two subsequent slayings-shifts among members of the insular community before the plausible yet slightly disappointing finale. Motives are determined and a guilty party pegged, but there's a sense that all is not resolved; the narrative loses sight of China's romance with an excop and puts the herb business on the back burner. Presumably these aspects of China's life will be detailed as the projected series progresses, but their obvious neglect here leaves readers with mixed feelings about this story's conclusion. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Qualitative Research &amp; Evaluation Methods: Integrating Theory and Practice</h2><p><p>Drawing on more than 40 years of experience conducting applied social science research and program evaluation, author Michael Quinn Patton has crafted the most comprehensive and systematic book on qualitative research and evaluation methods, inquiry frameworks, and analysis options available today.

And if they did, was it done uncritically? A respected Old Testament scholar and archaeologist engages with this controversial question by carefully comparing the biblical text to other ancient Near Eastern documents. Well-researched and thoughtfully nuanced, Currid aims to outline the precise relationship between the biblical worldview and that of Israel&#x2019;s neighbors.</p></p><p><p><strong>John D.

John Currid&#x2019;s books and commentaries have proven invaluable, and in this additional volume, his thorough research, theological acumen, and nuanced argumentation makes it an essential requirement for ministers, theological students, and serious students of Scripture. This is an invaluable aid in furthering our understanding of the Old Testament and a loud affirmation of the Bible&#x2019;s utter trustworthiness and inerrancy. A marvelous book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Derek W. H. Thomas,</strong>&nbsp;Chancellor&#x2019;s Professor of Systematic and Practical Theology, Reformed Theological Seminary; Teaching Fellow, Ligonier Ministries; Senior Minister, First Presbyterian Church, Columbia, South Carolina</p><p>&#x201c;This is a splendid introduction to the use that the Old Testament makes of the religious ideas of Israel&#x2019;s ancient neighbors. Currid compares the biblical accounts of creation and the flood with the versions from neighboring cultures and shows how the Bible puts down and rejects the theological ideas of Babylon, Egypt, the Hittites, and the Canaanites. This process, which Currid terms &#x2018;polemical theology&#x2019;, serves to demonstrate the unique sovereignty of the God of Israel. This is a very positive approach to the issues raised by the extrabiblical parallels and is greatly preferable to seeing the parallels as showing the Bible as simply borrowed pagan ideas and myths.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Gordon Wenham,</strong>&nbsp;Emeritus Professor of Old Testament, University of Gloucestershire, United Kingdom</p><p>&#x201c;In this vital work John Currid presents an enormously useful approach to understanding the relationship of the Old Testament to the literature and thought of Israel&#x2019;s ancient Near Eastern neighbors. This book is certainly a must read for any Old Testament scholar, yet it also provides a relevant and readable introduction for every student of Scripture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>David W. Chapman,</strong> Professor of New Testament and Archaeology, Covenant Theological Seminary; author, <em>Ancient Jewish and Christian Perceptions of Crucifixion</em></p><p>&#x201c;A rising influential voice in Old Testament studies is asserting that the biblical worldview, while monotheistic, often parallels and at times pirates with minimal discrimination the pre-enlightened religious ideas and rituals of ancient Israel&#x2019;s neighbors. In contrast, John Currid persuasively demonstrates in <em>Against the Gods</em> that the Bible&#x2019;s tendency is not to appropriate but to dispute and repudiate pagan myths, ideas, identities, and customs. This important introduction to Old Testament polemical theology provides a balanced corrective to many current comparative studies.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Jason S.

This is a chronicle of a couple coming together and breaking apart. There is courage in these pages because so much of what McClanahan details is ugly and desperate and raw&#x2015;everything, food, drink, love, heartbreak, to excess. The writing is so intimate you want to reach into the book to save this man from himself but you can't. That impossibility is what makes this book so memorable, so powerful." &#x2015;<strong>Roxane Gay</strong></p><p>"Scott McClanahan's writing is so pure, honest and immediately engaging, it felt like I wasn't just reading prose: it felt like I was reading the prose. THE SARAH BOOK is hilarious, unflinching and deeply sad. Its every chapter, every page, every observation an addictive delight. I read it in one sitting and days later am still stumbling around from its unexpected wallop." &#x2015;<strong>Maria Semple</strong></p><p>The Sarah Book (Tyrant Books, June '17) is indie lit icon Scott McClanahan's semi-autobiographical novel about love and loss in contemporary West Virginia. The Sarah Book is as humorous as it is sad, as tragic as it is hopeful, and as redeeming as it is damned. Through McClanahan&#x2019;s unique Appalachian vision, we watch a young couple fall in love, begin their life together and then fall apart as the marriage breaks down. The story is told all with the purple mountains and Wal-Marts of modern life in Appalachia as the backdrop. McClanahan weaves the telling of his life through a mix of language akin to the Romantic poets and hick twang that is unforgettable.</p><p>"The romance and destruction of a marriage. I couldn't put it down. Written with all the punches left in. McClanahan shows us the dents and scrapes and breakdowns of a man trying to be to a husband and father while at the same time sabotaging the very things he loves. Unnerving but remarkable." &#x2015;<strong>Willy Vlautin</strong></p><p>"Remarkably painful, funny, and grotesque, The Sarah Book offers a particularly American form of abjection. But what's remarkable is less the way McClanahan makes us gawk at this sodden car wreck of a life, but the way in which, despite all the messing up, he manages to touch on something tender and altogether human." &#x2015;<strong>Brian Evenson</strong></p><p>"Welcomely (and sometimes uncomfortably) honest, incredibly funny, and strangely beautiful." &#x2015;<strong>Vox</strong></p><p>"McClanahan writes as if he might be the illegitimate literary offspring produced from an accidental coupling of Flannery O'Connor and Harry Crews after a long night of bourbon drinking and something going awry during the birth." &#x2015;<strong>3:AM</strong></p><p>Scott McClanahan writes like Walt Whitman and Barry Hannah had a love child who grew up addicted to speed and porn and The History Channel. I've never read anything with so much wide-armed, grief-stricken love inside descriptions of strip clubs and drug deals and excrement and road kill and drunkenness and child neglect. I feel like there's almost no way to describe the book, it's so packed&#x2015;like McClanahan flung his arms open and gathered all the objects and people and emotions in his world, then compressed them into three-hundred thousand tiny quivering black marks, each one ready to explode with the slightest touch. I can't come up with a single adjective to capture the multiplicity of emotions I experienced as a reader, so I'll just say that The Sarah Book is a crazy heartbreaking surprising sad delicious desperate horrifying hilarious ride." &#x2015;<strong>Jamie Quatro</strong></p><p>The <i> Sarah Book </i> is the saddest song you've ever heard. It's the last sip of whiskey from a bottle that's been kicking around for too long. It's a mixed-up story of a great romance gone awry, told in Scott McClanahan's distinctive voice. The main characters are true love, paranoia, the devil, and God. It's set in parking lots and strip clubs and in shopping malls. It's fiction and it's memoir and it's also neither of those things. It's a hell of a read. &#x2015;<strong>The Fader</strong></p> (Maria Semple)</p><h2>Loose Woman: Poems</h2><p>A candid, sexy and wonderfully mood-strewn collection of poetry that celebrates the female aspects of love, from the reflective to the overtly erotic.

The book he inhabits shares his dimensions in its evocation of an aristocracy confronting democratic upheaval and the new force of nationalism. In the decades since its publication shortly after the author's death in 1957, <i>The Leopard</i> has come to be regarded as the twentieth century's greatest historical fiction.<br><br>Introduction by David Gilmour; Translation by Archibald Colquhoun<br><br>(Book Jacket Status: Not Jacketed)</p></p><p><i>The Leopard</i> is set in Sicily in 1860, as Italian unification is coming violently into being, but it transcends the historical-novel classification. E.M. Forster called it, instead, "a novel which happens to take place in history." Lampedusa's Sicily is a land where each social gesture is freighted with nuance, threat, and nostalgia, and his skeptical protagonist, Don Fabrizio, is uniquely placed to witness all and alter absolutely nothing. Like his creator, the prince is an aristocrat and an astronomer, a man "watching the ruin of his own class and his own inheritance without ever making, still less wanting to make, any move toward saving it." Far better to take refuge in the night skies. <p> What renders <i>The Leopard</i> so beautiful, and so despairing, is Lampedusa's grasp of human frailty and his vision of Sicily's arid terrain--"comfortless and irrational, with no lines that the mind could grasp, conceived apparently in a delirious moment of creation; a sea suddenly petrified at the instant when a change of wind had flung waves into frenzy." Though the author had long had the book in mind, he didn't begin writing it until he was in his late 50s. He died at 60, soon after it was rejected as unpublishable. </p><p> Archibald Colquhoun's lyrical translation also contains 70 more precious pages of Lampedusa--a memoir, a short story, and the first chapter of a novel. In "Places of My Infancy" the author warns that "the reader (who won't exist) must expect to be led meandering through a lost Earthly Paradise. If it bores him. I don't mind." Luckily, the reader does exist; even more luckily, boredom is not an option.</p>Introduction by David Gilmour; Translation by Archibald Colquhoun</p><h2>The Teacher&#39;s Grammar of English with Answers: A Course Book and Reference Guide</h2><p>The Teacher&#39;s Grammar of English is a comprehensive resource text designed to help ESL/EFL teachers understand and teach American English grammar.

It is the story of two cities at the height of their powers&#x2013;the hedonistic Mughal capital, in which the brilliant emperor Akbar the Great wrestles daily with questions of belief, desire, and the treachery of his sons, and the equally sensual city of Florence during the High Renaissance, where Niccol� Machiavelli takes a starring role as he learns, the hard way, about the true brutality of power. Profoundly moving and completely absorbing, <i>The Enchantress of Florence</i> is a dazzling book full of wonders by one of the world&#x2019;s most important living writers.</p><p><b>Amazon Best of the Month, June 2008</b>: Trying to describe a Salman Rushdie novel is like trying to describe music to someone who has never heard it--you can fumble with a plot summary but you won't be able to convey the wonder of his dazzling prose or the imaginative complexity of his vision. At its heart, <i>The Enchantress of Florence</i> is about the power of story--whether it is the imagined life of a Mughal queen, or the devastating secret held by a silver-tongued Florentine. Make no mistake, it is Rushdie who is the true "enchanter" of this story, conjuring readers into his gilded fairy tale from the very first sentence: "In the day's last light the glowing lake below the palace-city looked like a sea of molten gold." At once bawdy, gorgeous, gory, and hilarious, <i>The Enchantress of Florence</i> is a study in contradiction, highlighted in its barbarian philosopher-king who detests his bloodthirsty heritage even while he carries it out.

Dement, M.D., Ph.D. According to Dr. Dement, "sleep science" has yielded a great deal of scientific knowledge about sleep--yet the general public, and even doctors, aren't aware of it. Sleep disorders are routinely misdiagnosed or ignored, sometimes resulting in medical tragedy and death, frequently leading to chronic exhaustion. In <i>The Promise of Sleep</i>, Dr. Dement aims to remedy that by making the latest sleep information accessible to health professionals and lay readers. He describes the sleep cycle and gives a short history of sleep research. Then he dives into clear and detailed explanations of concepts and conditions we've all heard about, but that few of us understand: sleep debt, biological clock, circadian rhythm, insomnia, sleep apnea, narcolepsy. He discusses why we need sleep (sounds obvious, but it isn't) and the role of dreams. After 300 pages of sleep facts, Dr. Dement teaches you how to "reclaim healthy sleep" in your own life. You learn to assess your personal sleep situation by keeping a sleep diary, measuring your sleep debt, and evaluating your risk of sleep disorders; find appropriate treatment; manage sleep crises; and adopt a "sleep-smart lifestyle." A three-week "sleep camp" program at the end helps you put all the strategies together. This book will put you to sleep--and that's meant as praise! <i>--Joan Price</i>SLEEP BETTER, LIVE LONGER WITH THE GROUNDBREAKING INFORMATION AND STEP-BY-STEP PROGRAM IN THIS REVOLUTIONARY BOOK<p>Healthful sleep has been empirically proven to be the single most important factor in predicting longevity, more influential than diet, exercise, or heredity.

As Buddhism continues to grow in the West, Goldstein shows us the value of uniting this movement rather than allowing it to become fractured by its subtle differences. He does not advocate a watering down or mixing up of the various traditions. Rather, "We can practice each of them in its own integrity and come to a genuine depth of understanding." Readers who are wary of a scholarly analysis of Buddhist nuances need not worry. Goldstein (<i>The Experience of Insight</i>) relies on personal anecdotes and accessible language to explore the common themes in all Buddhist teachings. Though purists will no doubt quibble, Goldstein believes that following one Dharma is the way the West will be won, weaving together the methods of mindfulness, the motivation of compassion, and the liberating wisdom of nonclinging. "These three pillars--mindfulness, compassion, and wisdom--are not Indian or Burmese, Japanese or Tibetan; they are qualities in our own minds." <i>--Gail Hudson</i><p>Joseph Goldstein is a cofounder of the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, Massachusetts, where he is one of the resident guiding teachers.

While slavery had ended with the Civil War, the Jim Crow laws still separated blacks from whites, and the excesses of the Gilded Age created an elite upper class.

The first man, Louis de Franklin Munger, was a lissome figure, with a hawkish gaze, a bristle-thick mustache, and close-cropped hair parted at the apex of his forehead. Munger had once been crowned the world&#x2019;s fastest man and now, at the age of thirty-three, his championship days behind him, he was still widely recognized by an admiring public. Everyone called him &#x201c;Birdie,&#x201d; an appellation that evoked his love of speed and freedom. Now he had new ambitions. The second man, just eighteen years old, was described somewhat mysteriously in press accounts as Munger&#x2019;s &#x201c;valet.&#x201d; He seemed at first glance a short, slight figure, but a close look revealed a compact body with remarkably muscular legs.<br> <br>As the pair approached Madison Avenue and 26th Street, the arena&#x2014;the second of what would be several iterations of Madison Square Garden&#x2014;came into view. The structure was one of the city&#x2019;s greatest architectural confections, designed by the legendary Stanford White, whose firm was responsible for many of the Gilded Age mansions that lined the most fashionable streets of Manhattan. The Garden&#x2019;s Moorish arches marched down the avenue; a succession of teardrop-shaped cupolas ringed a fifth-story roof garden. High above, an Italianate tower concealed a private apartment and climbed another three hundred feet into the sky. Atop it all, an Augustus Saint-Gaudens sculpture of Diana, a twelve-foot-tall unclothed gilded figure aiming a bow and arrow at the winds, proclaimed to all who could see her from miles around that this was the grandest public palace in America.<br> <br>Munger and his young friend arrived early, before most of the spectators would stream through the Garden&#x2019;s granite pillars and into the marbled, mosaic entryway. Inside, parquet boards had been laid to create a bicycle-racing oval. More than nine thousand people could be squeezed into the galleries around the track, with standing room for several thousand more. A sliding glass roof opened for ventilation. Within hours, the crowds gathered, and the Garden buzzed with excited murmurs. At eight p.m., a group of racers assembled on the oval and mounted their bicycles. The twenty-five-foot-wide track was sharply curved and steeply banked to a degree that some riders deemed too dangerous. Workmen had applied a coating to the track that failed to cure evenly, leaving it slippery. The crowd noise reached a low roar as the racers readied. One of those at the starting line stood out. It was the teenager who had been called Munger&#x2019;s &#x201c;valet.&#x201d;<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Munger had been a legendary figure at the dawn of cycling, winning world records on a high-wheeler, which typically featured a large, solid wheel in the front and a small one in back. As his career faded in the early 1890s, a new type of bicycle had become wildly popular, with two equal-sized wheels and air-filled tubes. Munger had also raced the early, heavy versions of those models, and he now was in a contest to build the world&#x2019;s lightest, fastest &#x201c;safety&#x201d; cycles, as the new bikes were called.<br> <br>Indeed, Munger had appeared in this arena earlier in the year touting his bicycles as the world&#x2019;s best. Tens of thousands of New Yorkers viewed the wares of hundreds of exhibiters, marveling at the latest racing cycle, or a $5,000 showpiece festooned with diamonds, or an Army-designed model bristling with weaponry. The age of the automobile was more than a decade away. This was the time of the &#x201c;silent steed,&#x201d; ballyhooed as a replacement for the horse. One of every three patents in the 1890s was related to bicycle manufacture, and more than one million new bikes were expected to be sold in this boom year of 1896. The country had 30,000 bicycle shops and 250 bicycle factories. The main sports of the day were baseball, boxing, and bicycle racing&#x2014;and cycling was by far the most popular.<br> <br>Now, as the great annual race began at Madison Square Garden, the crowd focused on Munger&#x2019;s companion standing on the starting line with a lightweight, state-of-the-art bicycle. The prot�g� was unlike any racer the spectators had seen before at Madison Square Garden. He was a black man. Not just black, the press reported, but &#x201c;ebony,&#x201d; &#x201c;a veritable black diamond,&#x201d; &#x201c;the black meteor.&#x201d; Those were the kind descriptions. He was housed and sponsored by the South Brooklyn Wheelmen, which called him the &#x201c;dark secret of Gowanus,&#x201d; a reference to the Brooklyn neighborhood of brick industrial buildings where he began his training routes with the club&#x2019;s riders.<br> <br>The crowd buzzed as they realized they were about to witness a race of white versus black. At stake was much more than a bicycling victory; there was also the prevalent notion among whites that their race was superior. On one side of this contest was a clutch of the world&#x2019;s most experienced racers, all of them white. On the other was the little-known eighteen-year-old who had come to this unlikely moment under Birdie&#x2019;s wing.<br> <br>His name was Marshall Taylor, known as &#x201c;Major.&#x201d; The son of a soldier who had fought for the Union in the Civil War, Taylor had raced in amateur competitions but nothing like the vaunted venue of Madison Square Garden. This would be Taylor&#x2019;s professional racing debut. Logic might have dictated such a start should take place out of the spotlight, but Munger had suggested Taylor&#x2019;s professional career would begin at the top on this great stage. There was a band on hand, as usual, and the members looked through their sheaves of music for &#x201c;Dixie,&#x201d; known as the unofficial anthem of the Confederacy.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>How remarkable that Major Taylor was there at all. Six months earlier, in May 1896, the US Supreme Court had decided Plessy v. Ferguson, the case of Homer Plessy of Louisiana, who was determined to be seven-eighths Caucasian and one-eighth African, and had sought to ride in the first-class compartment of the East Louisiana Railroad. When he refused a detective&#x2019;s request to move to a blacks-only car, he was arrested for violating the 1890 Separate Car Act, which mandated that blacks and whites ride separately. The Supreme Court upheld the action on grounds that the cars were separate but equal. The ruling effectively accelerated the already heinous racism of the post&#x2013;Civil War era, institutionalizing Jim Crow laws for decades to come. Only one justice, John Marshall Harlan, dissented, saying &#x201c;It cannot be justified upon any legal grounds.&#x201d;<br> <br>One month after Plessy and five months before Taylor arrived at Madison Square Garden, William Jennings Bryan stood in the same arena and accepted the Democratic presidential nomination, saying, &#x201c;We believe, as asserted in the Declaration of Independence, that all men are created equal.&#x201d; Bryan, who nonetheless supported some segregationist policies to woo Southern voters, lost to William McKinley, a former Union officer who would do little to stop the growth of the Jim Crow era.<br> <br>If the world of sports had its own great dissenter amid this climate of racism, however, it was Munger. He bet his reputation that Taylor could, while riding a Munger-built bicycle, disprove those who believed that blacks were inferior and deserved segregation. Thus the symbolism represented by the starting line was extraordinary. A black man would compete with whites at Madison Square Garden, and may the best racer win.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Taylor wore skintight, woolen racing shorts and a shirt as he pushed his bike to the starting line. He was a son of two worlds: raised first by his poor family of black farmers, then taken in and tutored by a wealthy white family. He was better educated than most of his competitors, despite the insults hurled against him. He aimed to beat them not just with speed, but with knowledge, tactics, and cunning.<br> <br>The curtain raiser was a series of half-mile races, each five laps around the track. In every heat, the improperly treated surface caused racers to fall or go flying over the handlebars, but they would reappear in the next heat, &#x201c;legs and arms swathed up in bandages.&#x201d; The crowd cheered wildly as the racers who remained on their wheels dodged their fallen competitors.<br> <br>Taylor made his debut in the third heat. Riding a bicycle made by Munger, he bolted from the starting line and gained ground with every lap. He won easily to qualify for the final heat, pitting him against several of the world&#x2019;s fastest riders. A starter&#x2019;s pistol fired. Taylor&#x2019;s powerful legs turned the pedals. Quickly, he put ten yards between him and his closest competitor. &#x201c;Round and round the track whirled the colored rider, pedaling away like a steam engine,&#x201d; wrote the Brooklyn Eagle&#x2019;s correspondent. Taylor swiveled his head to see a racer named Eddie &#x201c;Cannon&#x201d; Bald&#x2014;considered one of the world&#x2019;s fastest sprinters&#x2014;closing in. Bald was &#x201c;straining every nerve&#x201d; to catch Taylor. The crowd surged from their seats to see if Taylor could hold on to his narrowing lead.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>In time, the rivalry between Bald and Taylor would be billed by a promoter as the white &#x201c;Adonis&#x201d; versus the &#x201c;great Negro.&#x201d; Bald would swear that he never wanted to &#x201c;let a nigger beat&#x201d; him, while Taylor saw Bald as the embodiment of the racism against him. Their rivalry would serve as a microcosm of the greater social history of the time, and come to an extraordinary conclusion for both men.<br> <br>Taylor&#x2019;s epic journey began twelve years before Jack Johnson, a black man, became heavyweight champion, and fifty years before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball. Yet here he was in 1896, wheel to wheel against white racers. His life would be one of the most singular of his era, a black man who took on Jim Crow, who crested at the height of the Gilded Age that was dominated by elite whites. His name eventually faded, but his story is far larger than one of sports. It is a story of one man&#x2019;s perseverance against relentless waves of prejudice, and of the enduring friendship of two men, one black and the other white, who joined together to push history forward.<br> <br>Taylor said from the beginning that Munger was pushing not only for the fastest time on the racetrack but also for the larger principle of equality, which victory would help make possible. So, Munger said of Taylor, &#x201c;I am going to make him the fastest bicycle rider in the world.&#x201d;<br> <br>And that, improbably, is what was about to happen.</p><h2>Global Dexterity: How to Adapt Your Behavior Across Cultures without Losing Yourself in the Process</h2><p><b> <i>I wrote this book because I believe that there is a serious gap in what has been written and communicated about cross-cultural management and what people actually struggle with on the ground</i>.&#x201d; From the Introduction</b><br><br>What does it mean to be a global worker and a true citizen of the world&#x201d; today?

He has never granted a writer access to his inner life &#x2013; until now. Based on six years of interviews with more than three hundred of Young&#x2019;s associates, and on more than fifty hours of interviews with Young himself, <b>Shakey</b> is a fascinating, prodigious account of the singer&#x2019;s life and career. Jimmy McDonough follows Young from his childhood in Canada to his cofounding of Buffalo Springfield to the huge success of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young to his comeback in the nineties. Filled with never-before-published words directly from the artist himself, <b>Shakey</b> is an essential addition to the top shelf of rock biographies.</p><p>Cantankerous and secretive, Neil Young has banished authors from his inner sanctum--until now. In <i>Shakey</i>, Jimmy McDonough distills more than 300 interviews (including guarded yet revealing interrogations of Young himself) into the definitive biography: the skyrocket success, willful disasters, health horrors and triumphs, stunning comebacks, and highly colorful scuffles with equally impossible characters like Stephen Stills, David Crosby, and the incompetent yet brilliant musicians of Crazy Horse. Young is not quite the noble soul some thought--he's an astounding control freak. But he is never less than fascinating. "As ruthless as I may seem to be," Young tells McDonough, "you gotta do what ya gotta do. Just like a f-----' vampire. Heh heh heh." <i>--Tim Appelo</i>&#x201c;Jimmy McDonough&#x2019;s fat, teeming, obsessive, and revelatory biography of Young is a pure shot of all-access pleasure. . . .

McDonough gets it all: the chaos, the grandeur, the good times and dreary deaths, the alcohol- and drug-besotted recording sessions, the broken hearts, and the sheer unfettered joy of a seriously gifted artist.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Salon<br><br></i>&#x201c;The definitive book on the subject.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Washington Post<br><br></i>&#x201c;Exhaustive, quarrelsome, and sometimes maddening . . . there are revelations in abundance.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review<br><br></i>&#x201c;Where the average rock-star biography is a tepid, toothless thing, McDonough has approached his task like a literary Terminator, steaming ahead with lethal thoroughness.

The long passages in which McDonough steps aside to let Young talk are the most revealing. &#x2018;One day I'm a jerk,&#x2019; Young says, &#x2018;the next day I'm a genius.&#x2019; This book argues artfully for the latter.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>People <br><br></i>&#x201c;Like meeting Brando's Kurtz in a cave at the end of <i>Apocalypse Now</i>. . . .

Her heart beat so hard she was afraid anyone close would hear. Everything hinged on making the official believe her. Josef had forged the papers, and he was the best. He could hack any computer, provide information or get it. She didn&#x2019;t doubt for a minute that the papers he created would be in order and pass close scrutiny, but she still had to make the official believe her.<br><br>The tin building was rusted and looked as if it might fall apart at any moment. A man came forward to meet her, looking solemn as the casket was wheeled ahead of her into the shade of the building. Fortunately the sun was setting and shadows fell around her, helping to make it more difficult to see her clearly.<br><br>&#x201c;Your papers?&#x201d; he said. His voice was kind. The name on his badge identified him as Erno Varga.<br><br>She glanced back toward the small plane she&#x2019;d flown to the airport and then handed her papers to the official, making certain her eyes were downcast and she looked weepy. She had taken care to use drops to make her eyes red and watery, just in case she couldn&#x2019;t pull off acting on her own.<br><br>Varga looked over her papers and then up at her several times with sharp, disbelieving eyes. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re young to be bringing home your brother&#x2019;s body alone. No one else is traveling with you?&#x201d;<br><br>She shook her head, trying to look more tragic than ever. &#x201c;My father is dead, and now my brother.&#x201d; She choked back a sob worthy, she was certain, of an Oscar performance. &#x201c;There is no one else to bring him home to our mother.&#x201d;<br><br>The official looked at her again and studied her papers closer. &#x201c;He died of a broken heart?&#x201d; There was skepticism in his voice.<br><br>Skyler nearly choked. When I get my hands on you, Josef, you&#x2019;re going to die of more than a broken heart. She used her telepathic connection with Josef to let him know he was in huge trouble.<br><br>A terrible tragedy. Josef was unrepentant as always. There was amusement in his tone. No matter how serious a situation, he didn&#x2019;t mind in the least being mischievous.<br><br>She managed to keep a straight face and gave Varga a solemn nod. &#x201c;He just wasted away when his girl left him. He refused to eat.&#x201d; She had no choice but to go with it, even if it meant twisting her fingers together hard in order to prevent the official from seeing she was shaking. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a terrible tragedy. Nothing could save him.&#x201d;<br><br>Okay, even to her ears, that sounded totally lame. But a broken heart? Only Josef would come up with something so dramatic and unbelievable. How else could she explain he&#x2019;d died of a broken heart? There was definitely going to be another cause of death after they opened the casket.<br><br>She could feel Josef&#x2019;s laughter. Of course you&#x2019;re laughing. You&#x2019;re safe in the coffin, the tragically dead brother, while I&#x2019;m lying my ass off to this man who could put me in prison for the rest of my life.<br><br>She knew Josef would never let that happen. If necessary he&#x2019;d give the official a &#x201c;push&#x201d; to believe her. Right now, he was having too much fun listening to her squirm&#x2014;and she supposed she deserved it. She was making him do something highly dangerous, and he would be blamed more than she would be if anything went wrong. Her father would probably just kill him on sight.<br><br>He will, too, Josef said. He&#x2019;ll rip me from limb to limb.<br><br>You should be worrying about me ripping you from limb to limb, she threatened.<br><br>&#x201c;How old are you?&#x201d; The official stared at her passport and papers and then back up to her face. &#x201c;Did you pilot that plane?&#x201d;<br><br>She lifted her chin, trying for older and much sterner. She knew she looked young, but not her eyes. If he looked her directly in the eye, he would believe what those forged papers said. And they were great forgeries. Josef had many talents, although making up stories was clearly not one of them.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m much older than I look,&#x201d; Skyler replied. It was partially the truth. She felt older, and that should count for something. She&#x2019;d been through more than most women&#x2014;okay, teens.<br><br>&#x201c;Twenty-five?&#x201d; he said skeptically.<br><br>Josef had insisted she be twenty-five if she was going to pilot the plane. Piloting planes had come easy to her and it was something she especially loved, so her adopted father, Gabriel, had allowed her to learn.<br><br>&#x201c;I have to open the coffin,&#x201d; the official added, watching her closely.<br><br>Skyler managed a little sob and covered her mouth, nodding slightly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. Yes, of course. They said you would. I was expecting you to.&#x201d; She straightened her shoulders and spine courageously.<br><br>He looked at her much more kindly. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to watch. Stand over there.&#x201d; He nodded to a corner of the building just a few feet away.<br><br>She felt a little sorry for him. If she knew anything at all about Josef, she knew he would put on some kind of show.<br><br>Don&#x2019;t you dare blow this by scaring him, she warned. I mean it, Josef.<br><br>You&#x2019;re no fun. I can always remove his memories. Wouldn&#x2019;t it be so delicious to do an impression of Count Dracula? I&#x2019;ve watched the movie a million times. I&#x2019;ve got the look and accent down perfectly.<br><br>He sounded far too eager. It took a lot of discipline to keep amusement from her mind where he could read it. She didn&#x2019;t doubt for a moment that Josef could do a perfect Dracula impression.<br><br>Resist the urge. We aren&#x2019;t out of the woods and we can&#x2019;t afford to take any chances. We&#x2019;re in Carpathian territory. Or at least close enough that someone might be near us to sense the use of energy. Restrain yourself, Josef.<br><br>He heaved a sigh. No matter what the outcome, your father is going to kill me, a slow and painful death, too. I should be able to have a little fun.<br><br>That was hitting very close to the truth. Gabriel was going to murder all of them, but if their plan worked, it would be well worth it.<br><br>She gave Varga a small, grateful smile and moved away from the coffin. Standing in the open door, her arms wrapped around her middle for comfort, she stared outside into the gathering darkness, holding herself very still. Their plan had to work.<br><br>Behave Josef, or else. Gabriel&#x2019;s in London and I&#x2019;m here. She had never been on the receiving end of Gabriel&#x2019;s wrath, but he and her uncle Lucian were legendary vampire hunters. The Carpathian people, most extremely powerful, whispered their names in awe.<br><br>You&#x2019;ve got a point. Laughter bubbled over in Josef&#x2019;s voice. What a sorry waste of a good coffin. Now there was disgust in his tone.<br><br>Skyler couldn&#x2019;t tell if he was going to behave or not. It was impossible with Josef. He marched to his own drum. She sent up a silent prayer, hoping for the best.<br><br>Right now, Francesca and Gabriel were probably awake and would soon be preparing to fly to the Carpathian Mountains. They thought she was a continent away, safe with her human college friend Maria, using her vacation to help build homes and run irrigation to farmers in South America. She had never lied to them before. Not once. And it hurt her to do it now, but there was no other way.<br><br>She knew her parents had been summoned to the huge meeting between Lycan and Carpathian to discuss an alliance between the two species. Most of the Carpathians had been called home. Gabriel and Francesca had been more than happy to receive a call from her from school asking to go with Maria. They didn&#x2019;t want her anywhere near the Carpathian Mountains.<br><br>She would never think of repaying their extraordinary kindness, the love they had given her from the moment she&#x2019;d been taken into their home, with lies and betrayal&#x2014;not for anything or anyone accept Dimitri. Dimitri Tirunul was her unexpected miracle. A man beyond any she&#x2019;d ever dreamt of. She was human. He was Carpathian&#x2014;nearly immortal. She was nineteen years old. He was an ancient, centuries old. She held the other half of his soul, the light to his darkness. Without her, he would not survive. She was his lifemate&#x2014;his savior. Yet she knew just the opposite was true&#x2014;Dimitri was the one saving her.<br><br>He knew she was his lifemate when she was just a child, and he had given her time. Space. Unconditional love. He never demanded anything of her. He never told her how difficult it was for him&#x2014;that she was his salvation&#x2014;just out of his reach. He had always been there for her, in the middle of the night, when her violent past was too close and she couldn&#x2019;t sleep, when nightmares haunted her to the point she couldn&#x2019;t breathe. He was there, in her mind, holding all those terrifying memories at bay. Dimitri. Her Dimitri.<br><br>Dimitri was caught in the middle between the two species. The Lycans had taken him and planned to kill him. No one had gone after him to save him. He had spent centuries hunting the undead to keep his people as well as humans safe. He had survived honorably when others had chosen to give up their souls. Yet there was no rescue party. No hunters were rushing to save him. He was badly injured. She felt that much before he cut himself off from her to protect her from his pain&#x2014;or his death.<br><br>Dimitri was stoic about life or death. He was a Carpathian hunter and he&#x2019;d been around for centuries, protecting innocents from vampires. Her lineage was complicated, but for all intents and purposes, she was human. The Lycans would never expect a teenage, human girl to mount a rescue operation for a Carpathian. She had the element of surprise on her side. That, as well as good, trustworthy friends and her very powerful but untested abilities.<br><br>Skyler had faith in herself. She knew her every strength and every weakness. Like Josef, she was extremely intelligent and most of the time underestimated. She believed the Lycans would underestimate her&#x2014;she was counting on it.<br><br>No one would start a war over a Carpathian hunter it seemed, but she knew her father would come after her, and if anyone harmed one hair on her head, the Lycan world would be in for a nightmare it couldn&#x2019;t possibly conceive. Not only would Gabriel come after her, but so would her uncle Lucian. She was fairly certain her biological father, Razvan, and his lifemate, Ivory, would join the hunt for her. They were extremely lethal as well. There was satisfaction in knowing if she was injured or killed, she would be avenged. No one, not even Mikhail Dubrinsky, the prince of the Carpathian people, would be able to stop a war if the Lycans harmed her.<br><br>She lifted her chin. Dimitri would never leave her in danger. He would rush to her side the moment he knew there was trouble; he had&#x2014;more than once&#x2014;just to soothe bad dreams when she had too many in a row. She couldn&#x2019;t do less for him.<br><br>Holding her breath, she turned back to watch the official gingerly open the coffin. It creaked ominously. Hideously. Just like in the movies. The sound sent a chill down her spine. The lid rose slowly and darn Josef anyway, it looked as if it was lifting all by itself. Varga stepped back, one hand going up defensively.<br><br>There was silence as the lid came to a stop. Nothing moved. She could hear the sound of a clock ticking loudly. Varga coughed nervously. He glanced at her. Skyler put her hand over her mouth and lowered her eyes.<br><br>Josef! Behave yourself. Skyler was somewhere between laughing and crying with nervous tension.<br><br>Varga stepped back to the coffin and peered in, beads of sweat visible on his forehead. He cleared his throat. &#x201c;He certainly looks robust for a man who starved himself to death.&#x201d;<br><br>The least you could have done was make yourself look emaciated if you wanted him to believe your preposterous story, she scolded.<br><br>Skyler pressed a handkerchief to her mouth. &#x201c;They did such a good job at the funeral home. I particularly asked them to make certain he looked good for our mother.&#x201d;<br><br>Varga pressed his lips together and studied the body. He was suspicious, but she wasn&#x2019;t certain of what. Clearly there was a dead body in the coffin. Did he suspect her of running drugs? Guns? If so, that didn&#x2019;t bode well for what she had planned. She needed to look like a na�ve, young teenager who might be slightly ditzy.<br><br>She held her breath as he reached for the lid of the coffin and slowly closed it.<br><br>&#x201c;Is someone coming for you?&#x201d; Varga asked as he locked the coffin lid and glanced at his watch. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stay. You were the last plane coming in.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My brother&#x2019;s friend arranged for a truck to pick us up. He&#x2019;ll be here any minute,&#x201d; Skyler assured him solemnly. &#x201c;Thank you so much for all your help.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You can wait in here,&#x201d; Varga said in a kind voice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come back in a couple of hours and lock up.&#x201d; He looked around the dilapidated building. It was nothing more than four metal walls, mostly rusted, some so badly there were holes. &#x201c;Not that there&#x2019;s much to lock up.&#x201d; He glanced again at his watch. &#x201c;I would wait with you, but I have another job to go to.&#x201d;<br><br>She sent him a wan smile. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right. Really. He&#x2019;ll be here any minute.&#x201d;<br><br>Varga gave her one last look and exited the rickety building, leaving her there alone with the locked coffin. Skyler waited until she saw his car drive off and the lights disappear completely down the road. She took a careful look around. She appeared to be alone.<br><br>&#x201c;Josef, you can quit playing dead,&#x201d; Skyler said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. She banged on the coffin lid with her fist. &#x201c;Died of a broken heart? Really? You couldn&#x2019;t think of anything else, anything, say, more realistic?&#x201d;<br><br>The lid of the coffin opened with the same series of ominous, horror film creaks he&#x2019;d used when Varga had opened the lid. There was silence. Skyler&#x2019;s heart beat steadily. She leaned over the coffin and glared at the young man who lay as if dead, his arms crossed over his chest and his eyes closed. His skin was pale porcelain and his black spiky hair with the dyed blue tips stood out starkly against the white backdrop.<br><br>&#x201c;You look amazingly robust for a man who starved himself to death,&#x201d; she said sarcastically, mimicking the official. &#x201c;You could have blown everything with your absurd story.&#x201d;<br><br>Josef&#x2019;s eyes snapped open dramatically. He faked an accent as he slowly sat up. &#x201c;I could use a drop of blood or two, my dear.&#x201d;<br><br>She smacked him over the head with her papers. &#x201c;The customs official didn&#x2019;t believe I was twenty-five.&#x201d;<br><br>Josef flashed a cocky grin. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not. You&#x2019;re barely nineteen, and when Gabriel and Lucian find out what we&#x2019;ve done, we&#x2019;re both going to be in more trouble than either of us has ever known.&#x201d; He paused, the smile fading from his mouth. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ve been in a lot of trouble.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We have no choice,&#x201d; Skyler said.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t kid yourself, Sky, there&#x2019;s always a choice. And you aren&#x2019;t the one they&#x2019;re going to kill. I&#x2019;m going to be their prime target. When Gabriel and Lucian come looking for you&#x2014;and they will,&#x201d; Josef said, &#x201c;they&#x2019;ll find you. They have a reputation for a reason. If we really do this, every Carpathian hunter will be out looking.&#x201d;<br><br>Her father, Gabriel, was extremely powerful, a legendary Carpathian hunter. Her uncle Lucian, Gabriel&#x2019;s twin, had helped to create that legend among the Carpathian people, and when they discovered her gone, of course they would come after her.<br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that the point?&#x201d; Skyler replied with a small shrug. &#x201c;By the time they wake and realize we&#x2019;re gone, we&#x2019;ll have a good head start. We should be able to find Dimitri.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You do realize,&#x201d; Josef said, floating out of the coffin, &#x201c;this could very well cause an international incident. Or worse, war. All-out war.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You agreed to help me,&#x201d; Skyler said. &#x201c;Have you changed your mind?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. You&#x2019;re my best friend, Sky. Dimitri probably despises me and wishes I was dead, but he&#x2019;s your lifemate and he&#x2019;s been literally thrown to the ...</p><h2>The Sculptor In The Sky</h2><p><p>"You can not have a life, you can not lose a life...

In the first years of her life, it became apparent that she had been born with extrasensory abilities. Among these abilities she was born with were clairvoyance, clairsentience, clairaudience, the ability to manipulate electromagnetic fields and the ability to communicate with thought forms. As she grew, unlike many children born with extrasensory abilities, her gifts did not go away. Her parents, who were both Wilderness Rangers, later accepted a job in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest of Utah, not knowing at the time about the intensely religious climate of the location. Word of her abilities got out very quickly and were not only frowned upon but feared by many in the religious community. It was because of Teal&#39;s extrasensory abilities that she was inducted as a child into a local cult by a family acquaintance, where she was routinely ritualistically tortured and programmed for a period of thirteen years. She managed to escape from the cult when she was 19 years old. Since then, Teal has become a contemporary spiritual guide, both accepting and utilizing her extraordinary abilities to remind people of the united, energetic nature of this universe and to teach people how to find bliss in the midst of even the most extreme circumstances.

The teachings in this book show how to recognize resistance in its many forms, not take it personally, and be free of its control. The platform is that the voice of resistance&#x2014;thoughts such as <i>I'll do it later</i>&#x2014;is not personal; everyone has it. Instead, it is the voice of a survival system that can take people from commitment to inaction in a matter of seconds. Then, self-hating voices level internal accusations for not having followed through, including thoughts of failure, shame, and lack of self-discipline.</p></p><p><p><b>Cheri Huber</b> is the founder of the Zen Center in Palo Alto, California, and the Zen Monastery Peace Center in Murphys, California.

It&#x2019;s meant to be taken out and shared with others when the reader feels moved. You, dear reader, are the inspiration for this sweet collection, because of your love of prayer, of ritual, of ceremony, and of the hundreds of SouLodge sisters and their families who have come to prayer in your own language, in your own time, in dialogue with the Source of All Life as you understand it.Among its pages are twenty-eight prayers of gratitude and support for new beginnings, vision, purpose, freedom, community, movement, forgiveness, transitions, surrender, descent, rites of passage, releasing, completion, wisdom, leadership, balance, connection, oneness, and peace.Grounding, uplifting, and inspiring, the purpose of this portable collection is to access the reader&#x2019;s open heart space to the divine light which lives in us through the Great Mystery, and provide connection to the bountiful Earth upon which we live.It&#x2019;s been said that the Earth and Sky are mirrors for our human experiences.

It gestated for a year before I began to compile the poem-like prayers into a collection for sharing with others. They are very personal to me and also universal in their application. My inspiration for writing the book was to create a portable compendium of friends to call on for almost any occasion. Each prayer is connected to a cycle of life, a transient place we visit when our experiences find us at the crossroads. I wrote them to honor that which is seldom celebrated: those intimate moments in nature which mirror our human experiences.<br>I wrote Prayers of Honoring because I wanted to restore faith in the reader's dialogue with the Source of Life As He or She Understands It. The natural world is my altar and the spirit energy which lives between the cells of every living thing is what I am in awe of.<br>I hope you're inspired to read the prayers and add your own thoughts on the lined pages provided.

For the first time, English-language audiences have access to her artistry with the publication of the French bestseller, <i>Mes Confitures: The Jams and Jellies of Christine Ferber</i>. Written in a clear,accessible style, <i>Mes Confitures</i> brings hand-made jams to life for home cooks and professional chefs alike.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>Mes Confitures</i>, Ferber opens her personal recipe book, sharing such treasures as Black Cherry with Pinot Noir, Apricot and Spiced Apple, and Rosehip and Vanilla. Organized seasonally, uncommon recipes like Rhubarb with Acacia Honey and Rosemary, or Banana, Orange, and Chocolate jams raise the craft of confiture to a new level. Ferber also divulges her secrets, identifying the proper tools and equipment for foolproof, exciting, and unusual creations.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ferber&#x2019;s use of locally grown, extraordinary ingredients, most of which are accessible in farmers&#x2019; markets, gourmet foodshops, or by mail-order, makes for exquisite jams that are far more interesting than the everyday. Ferber&#x2019;s jams are artisanal in their reliance on seasonal fruits, traditional techniques, and their emphasis on simplicity and freshness.</p></p><p><p>Christine Ferber lives in Alsace, where she continues to make jams, pastry, and confections by hand, with only the freshest local ingredients. She is the author of several books on French cookery.</p>Ferber is a fourth-generation French patissiere whose specialty is her unusual, delicious jams and jellies, which have gained an international following among chefs (Alain Ducasse, who wrote the foreword, serves them at his renowned restaurants) and other gourmands. This book, a best seller in France, presents dozens of recipes, organized by season, for preserves from Black Cherry with Pinot Noir to Greengage and Mirabelle Plum with Mint; a number of them include chocolate, not a standard addition. Few of the recipes include headnotes, although translator's notes identify the more exotic ingredients; instructions are on the brief side. However, any jam maker will find Ferber's book fascinating.

Today he is a curiosity in American history, but as Gail Collins shows in this entertaining and revelatory biography, he and his career are worth a closer look. The son of a signer of the Declaration of Independence, Harrison was a celebrated general whose exploits at the Battle of Tippecanoe and in the War of 1812 propelled him into politics, and in time he became a leader of the new Whig Party, alongside Daniel Webster and Henry Clay. But it was his presidential campaign of 1840 that made an indelible mark on American political history. </p><p>Collins takes us back to that pivotal year, when Harrison's "Log Cabin and Hard Cider" campaign transformed the way candidates pursued the presidency. It was the first campaign that featured mass rallies, personal appearances by the candidate, and catchy campaign slogans like "Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too." Harrison's victory marked the coming-of-age of a new political system, and its impact is still felt in American politics today. It may have been only a one-month administration, but we're still feeling the effects.</p></p><p><b>Gail Collins</b> is an op-ed columnist for <i>The New York Times</i>, where she previously served as editorial page editor&#x2015;the first woman to hold that position.

Harrison's one-month term in office was really nothing more than a list of nonachievements (only president never to appoint a federal judge; his wife the only first lady since the construction of the White House who never saw it) and a cautionary tale about the importance of not making long speeches in the rain.</p> <p>My answer is that I felt I owed him.</p> <p>This goes back to a time when I was in Cincinnati, on a publicity tour for a book I'd written about gossip and its effect on politics in American history. Cincinnati is my hometown. It's also the place where Harrison settled, after a childhood in plantation Virginia and a stint governing the Indiana Territory. When I was in high school I won the local Veterans of Foreign Wars' "Speak for Democracy" contest and my reward was to read my speech to some of the veterans and my loyal parents at Harrison's tomb, which was large but rather bleak.</p> <p>William Henry was a character in my gossip book&#x2014;mainly to illustrate my theory that his embarrassment over having been criticized as too old and feeble to be president had led him to demonstrate his strength and virility by giving a nearly two-hour-long inauguration speech in bad weather, which made him sick and then&#x2014;with the help of a team of overenergetic doctors&#x2014;dead.</p> <p>Since it is always a good idea to push the local angle, I was interviewed by an Ohio TV station while standing in front of a statue of Harrison, mounted on a steed I presumed was Whitey, the faithful companion he rode in the inauguration parade and which the ever-quotable John Quincy Adams dismissed as "a mean horse."</p> <p>Later, visiting my family, I was telling the story of how Harrison was born a Virginia aristocrat but was marketed to the voters as a humble old soldier drinking cider in a log cabin.</p> <p>"And he really had this big, beautiful house," I said, in what I thought was going to be the final word on the subject.</p> <p>"Yes," my father said matter-of-factly. "That was a really big house."</p> <p>Several seconds of silence.</p> <p>"How do you know about William Henry Harrison's house?" I asked.</p> <p>"I tore it down," he said somberly.</p> <p>My father worked for the Cincinnati Gas and Electric Company, and he said that back in the 1960s he was told to get together a crew of workers and demolish the "Harrison Mansion," which was still standing on part of the site of the North Bend, Ohio, power station, where he worked.</p> <p>I looked this up, my family's big intersection with presidential history. It turns out that the house was part of a Harrison family compound on two thousand acres of farmland that the Harrisons owned along the Ohio River. It was called The Point and was occupied by one of the Harrison sons, John Scott. William Henry's own sixteen-room home burned down before the Civil War. By then he was dead, as were nine of his ten children. His widow, Anna, moved into The Point with John Scott and his family, which included a Harrison grandson, Benjamin, who would eventually become president of the United States himself.</p> <p>It was a serious landmark&#x2014;home of one future president and proof of the lifestyle choices of his alleged log-cabin-dwelling grandfather. By the time the modern era came around, the two Presidents Harrison had become so blurred in history that the preservationists couldn't raise money to restore it. "The house now so desolate a picture, is of brick built in colonial style," a Cincinnati newspaper reported in 1940. "That hardware and glass in it, most of which is still intact, was brought over the Allegheny Mountains and down the river by boat . . . two features of unusual beauty are the circular staircase in the entrance hall and the original leaded glass transom over the front door."</p> <p>Cincinnati Gas and Electric declared itself perfectly willing to hand over the house to any public-spirited group that wanted to move it someplace else, but the management was clearly a little worried that it would be declared a historic monument right there in the middle of the power plant. And one day they quietly ordered a crew of men, including my father, to decimate it.</p> <p>So this book began as an act of familial penance.</p> <p>Researching it, I was relieved to learn that there's another Harrison home that has been preserved&#x2014;Grouseland, the house William Henry built for his family in Vincennes, Indiana, when he was sent there as territorial governor when he was still a young man in his twenties. It's a very impressive place even now, but back in 1801, when the territory had no roads and Vincennes had only about seven hundred people, it was regarded as the eighth wonder of the world. Everything had to be imported, often from Europe. Grouseland tells you more about Harrison than the North Bend home ever could have&#x2014;how he wanted the people he was responsible for governing to see that, even though he was very young, he was a man to be reckoned with. How determined he was to make sure his children were raised at the same level of privilege that he had been on the Virginia plantation. Why Harrison, a man without any large personal fortune, was going to spend his entire life desperately searching for cash.</p> <p>Besides catching pneumonia during his inauguration, Harrison is famous for things he didn't actually do. He didn't win a big military victory at Tippecanoe&#x2014;it was a minor fight against an outnumbered village of Indians, and because Harrison screwed up the defense of his camp the white Americans suffered most of the casualties. He did better during the War of 1812. But his real impact on history arguably came from the work he did in the Grouseland years&#x2014;acquiring several states' worth of territory from the Indians in deals that cost the federal government only pennies per acre. This is not a part of our history that we celebrate, and even back in 1840 the voters preferred the stories of battlefield heroics.</p> <p>Politically, Harrison's greatest achievement was to star in what is still celebrated as one of the most ridiculous presidential campaigns in history. But even then, other men came up with the story line about Harrison the humble soldier and pushed it into the national memory forever with months of singing from The Log Cabin Songbook and dancing "The Log Cabin Two-Step."</p> <p>William Henry's own contribution was to become the first presidential candidate to personally campaign for the job, and he willingly plowed into crowds to shake endless hands and at least pretend to remember all the veterans who wanted to reminisce about serving under him.</p> <p>Then he won and then he died. I am going to take a big historic leap and guess that if he had lived&#x2014;if Anna Harrison had accompanied her husband to Washington and demanded that he carry an umbrella at all times&#x2014;William Henry would still not have been the sort of chief executive who gets his head carved on the side of a mountain. He was living in a bad time for presidents, that long gray period between Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln when the great cloud of slavery and approaching civil war would make everybody&#x2014;even an effective president like James Polk&#x2014;seem like a historic asterisk.</p> <p>There was nothing in Harrison's history that suggests transformational leader. If he had lived, the country would still have made its long march toward the Civil War. Perhaps the Whig Party would have made a bigger, longer impact if he had spent four years in the White House instead of John Tyler. But it is my experience that there are not many Americans, or even many American historians, who are particularly interested in speculating on what it would have meant if things had worked out better for the Whigs.</p> <p>The William Henry Harrison story is less about issues than about the accidents of fate and silly campaigns. It's always tempting to look back on American history and marvel about how things were just like today. They weren't. In 1840, the nation was full of wide-open spaces, but it was also dark and dirty. In the countryside, people lived in small, gloomy homes. The cities were dangerous places full of violence, horse dung, and men who chewed tobacco and spit everywhere. Women could not vote, and the average baby had a life expectancy of about forty-five years.</p> <p>Yet the campaign of 1840 seems so . . . modern. Besides the cold pragmatism of the Tippecanoe mythmakers, what stuns us about the Harrison campaign is the apparent gullibility of the voters. The Whigs were describing him as a simple product of a log cabin in one breath and bragging about his father signing the Declaration of Independence in the next. Didn't they think the people were listening?</p> <p>Well they were, in the same way we are today, although we can hear the rapid responses in less than a minute, while they had to wait a couple of weeks for the mail. The voters had their ears open for any suggestion that one of the candidates had an answer to their problems. And if not, they looked for the one who might have their trials in mind when he had to make a decision about banks or budgets or foreign affairs.</p> <p>And William Henry Harrison answered the bill, sort of. He was very good at things paternal. As a general he was extremely kind to his men, willing to share their privations and the dangers to which he exposed them. He was open and friendly with people of every station. As a politician, his only consistent and passionate cause was getting federal aid for disabled veterans and for the families of those who had fallen. His own dinner table, which was crowded enough with his many relatives, was also filled with the widows and children of dead comrades.</p> <p>His central mission was actually just taking care of his family. He had ten kids, plus quite a few orphan wards. If the land along the Ohio had produced enough money to support them all in a Virginia-gentry lifestyle, he probably would have spent his post-military life worrying about crops and livestock and going to the occasional testimonial dinner where his neighbors would recall the glories of the War of 1812. But as it was, he spent much of his time nagging important politicians to give him a job that would provide enough cash to bridge the difference between the farm's income and his household budget.</p> <p>He reminds me in many ways of my own father, although unlike William Henry my dad really did come from humble roots. And unlike William Henry, his hard work did not pay off in the end with a sudden burst of fortune that would propel him into American history. But they both had to make their own way from the time they were young. They both found themselves responsible for a passel of kinfolk and they readily accepted the burden of providing for them.</p> <p>If the Harrison mansion in Cincinnati had been preserved, school groups could go through it today, take note of the awesomeness of the architectural embellishments, and be tasked to compare the site to the vision of the log cabin homestead that the Whig Party marketed in 1840. It would be an excellent lesson in the unreliability of campaign literature, but my impression is that the youth of America is already cynical enough on this point.</p> <p>Maybe someday he'll be repackaged in a way that's more inspiring&#x2014;not as the guy who got elected president by pretending to be something he wasn't and then made a fatal inauguration speech in the rain, but as a struggling American dad in a difficult era, trying to keep food on the table and a roof over everybody's head. And maybe an imported leaded-glass transom over the door.</p> <p>Copyright � 2012 by Gail Collins</p></p><h2>Realizing Genjokoan: The Key to Dogen&#39;s Shobogenzo</h2><p>Dogen, the thirteenth-century Zen master who founded the Japanese Soto school of Zen, is renowned as one the world's most remarkable religious geniuses.

After four days, a community search party comes upon Sarah's footprints with bear tracks beside them, and concludes the worst: "She's been torn to pieces!" The next day, a stranger appears, claiming that he has seen the child in a dream. The vision leads to Sarah's rescue, and the community celebrates her safe return with a great feast. Readers will be intrigued by the authors' real-life connection to the story's heroine (Sarah is an ancestor of sisters Kinsey and Kinsey-Warnock). Although Rand's watercolors include some cliched poses (as when Sarah curls up beside the bear with her hands neatly clasped under her head), their luminous gray-green palette is appropriately woodsy. Without being overtly cute, Sarah's ursine rescuer is a particularly benign and cozy presence. Plainly told, this sturdy tale exudes comfort.

Reeve&#x2019;s mom and dad are both at work&#x2014;his mom cutting hair at a local salon called Sasha&#x2019;s and his dad selling beds at the Mattress Firm. The blinds are pulled down to block the afternoon sun, and harsh spears of light stab between the slits in the darkened living room. They&#x2019;ve eaten an entire bag of Doritos when Sam sits up straight and turns to Reeve. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s do something,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;These shows are so boring.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Whaddya want to do?&#x201d; Reeve asks.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Anything.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Want to go outside?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Too hot,&#x201d; Sam groans.<br> <br>Reeve pries himself away from the couch cushion and sits forward, wiping his Dorito-stained fingers on the side of his shorts. &#x201c;I wish it was already my birthday,&#x201d; Reeve says, thinking of the day just a few weeks away, August seventh.<br> <br>&#x201c;Me too. You gonna have a party?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Probably. I think my parents got me a Nintendo.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No way,&#x201d; Sam says.<br> <br>&#x201c;I swear.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah? Where is it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where would they hide it?&#x201d; Sam asks.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Reeve shrugs. &#x201c;Probably in their bedroom.&#x201d;<br> <br>A mischievous expression brightens Sam&#x2019;s face&#x2014;one familiar to Reeve. It&#x2019;s one he&#x2019;s seen many times, the product of their age&#x2014;two nine-year-old boys eager to explore. Once when they were playing by a creek, Sam found some old shark&#x2019;s teeth mixed up in the gravel, and after they&#x2019;d plucked them all out and put them in a plastic bag they&#x2019;d gotten from Sam&#x2019;s mom, Sam wanted to find more. He insisted they cross the creek to the other side. But Reeve knew water moccasins nested in that part of the stream where it was deep and cool from lush ferns draping over the water. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think we should,&#x201d; Reeve said. Reeve was a cautious boy. Nobody would have ever described him as a daredevil. But Sam&#x2014;he didn&#x2019;t mind taking risks. &#x201c;See you on the other side, scaredy-cat,&#x201d; he had called as he took off his sneakers and fearlessly waded into the water.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s look,&#x201d; Sam says, getting off the couch, wearing the same expression as the time he crossed the shadowy creek.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, my mom and dad said I can&#x2019;t go in their room.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, come on.&#x201d; He runs out of the family room, down the hallway to the master bedroom. Reeve hops off the couch and follows, worried only about the transgression of going into his parents&#x2019; room for maybe a second.<br> <br>The room is dim like the TV room, the stiff green curtains drawn, also to block out the August sun. The king-size bed is made with a stiff, gaudy floral-print bedspread perfectly smooth and neatly creased in all four corners.<br> <br>Sam opens Reeve&#x2019;s parents&#x2019; closet doors first and searches the floor, crouching down and shoving shoes aside to look into the corners. Then he stands and lifts his head to eye the upper shelf that he can&#x2019;t reach. He jumps up to see if he can get high enough to peer over the top and to the sides to spy a box big enough to hold a Nintendo.<br> <br>Reeve opens drawers by the bed, but sees nothing but papers and envelopes containing Polaroid family photos, school portraits of him and his younger sister, progress reports from their elementary school, and other miscellaneous papers and special certificates. Sam comes over and torpedoes himself onto the bed, stands, and begins hopping on it. Reeve laughs and joins him&#x2014;two giggling boys caught up in the giddiness of being in a forbidden place. They bounce as if it&#x2019;s a trampoline, the springs of the mattress squeaking, protesting with each landing, the bedspread no longer perfect.<br> <br>&#x201c;What about in that chest?&#x201d; Sam points to the base of the bed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nah, she doesn&#x2019;t usually put anything in there except clothes.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sam launches himself off the mattress and lands with a thump on the floor. He flings an afghan folded across the wooden chest onto the now-rumpled bedspread, lifts the lid, and peers in. &#x201c;Not in here,&#x201d; he says, moving its contents around with his free arm. &#x201c;Just a blanket and bunch of old sweaters.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Told ya.&#x201d; Reeve hops off too, his cheeks hot and flushed from the jumping. He kneels down to look under the bed, lifting the skirt. White stringy strands worn free from under the lining of the mattress box drape down like webbing made from a huge spider. Reeve blows at them, but they fall right back into place, so he moves them aside with his hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;Whoa,&#x201d; Reeve says when he spots the rifle. He&#x2019;s seen it only once before. He&#x2019;d been out playing in the neighborhood when several other kids spotted a rattlesnake curled up in a cement drainage ditch at the end of the cul-de-sac. Word spread, and everyone in the neighborhood gathered around while his father came out to take a look. His dad told the kids and other neighbors who&#x2019;d gathered to stay away from the ditch until he returned. When he did, he carried the gun, walked over with purpose, instructed all the other parents to keep their kids back, but when he looked down into the ditch, there was nothing but moss and twigs. The snake had slithered away into the brush.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wow!&#x201d; Sam says, walking over to Reeve, who&#x2019;s kneeling beside the bed and holding the rifle across his thighs. The barrel is shiny smooth, its heft intimidating but stealth-like, and Reeve is excited to show Sam that he&#x2019;s not always a bore. For a second, Reeve thinks he shouldn&#x2019;t have pulled it out from under the bed, but it&#x2019;s as tempting as shark&#x2019;s teeth and Sam would have grabbed it if he hadn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;Cool,&#x201d; Sam says.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; Reeve breathes hard with excitement, the back of his neck slick with sweat. He&#x2019;s sure the gun is not loaded, and in one quick motion, he stands and lifts the rifle to take aim at . . . at . . . he&#x2019;s not sure what, maybe the chair in the corner of the room, maybe the curtains. He barely feels his finger on the trigger when a deafening boom blasts his ears&#x2014;the report so explosive and the kick so violent that he thinks that he&#x2019;s just launched himself into something vast, like the sky or outer space. And that&#x2019;s where he remains&#x2014;tumbling through that empty void, never really landing&#x2014;for a very long time.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>I also imagine the six-foot diameter spatter of reddish-brown blood because he fired a .30-06 caliber rifle. The force of it at close range is quite destructive and would blow a ragged hole through the victim, typically shattering bone and tissue. There would have been spatter on the wall, the carpet, and the bed. The bullet tore through the victim&#x2019;s shoulder, blew through his heart and lodged into the wall behind them, so there would have been a hole about the size of a pea in the plaster.<br> <br>The boy&#x2014;the shooter&#x2014;attempted to stop the flow of blood by putting his hands over the wound, so ugly smears would stretch across both the victim&#x2019;s and the shooter&#x2019;s clothes. He also tried to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to the victim, which he&#x2019;d apparently learned about in school just months before, so his DNA could be easily collected from the victim&#x2019;s mouth if they&#x2019;d needed it, but they didn&#x2019;t because the boy admitted everything.<br> <br>Bloodstains as well as the spatter would also be on the bedside table and phone because the boy called 911 and frantically said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve shot my best friend. My best friend is dead. I didn&#x2019;t know my dad&#x2019;s gun was loaded.&#x201d; He shouted this in a guttural panic that was recorded by the 911 emergency service operator and would later be played over and over by the press in the aftermath of the gun-control debates that eventually ensued across the state.<br> <br>I always consider details like this since I&#x2019;m trained to look at the particulars. I used to work in the bustling Newark field office until I was transferred to a resident agency, a smaller office with only one or two agents that have jurisdiction over an area, usually someplace more rural. For an agent, the best way to gain experience is to work in a variety of settings, even if it means moving across the country to the remote resident office in Kalispell, Montana.<br> <br>I miss the city, but I don&#x2019;t mind Montana. I remember seeing the great spine of the Rockies for the first time when I drove across the eastern plains from Newark toward the Continental Divide. I&#x2019;ll admit I was a little freaked out at the sight of bleak fields the color of camel hair stretching into oblivion; the glimpses of old long-abandoned cabins and wood barns buckling and decomposing onto the bare ground; the rain blowing horizontally against the ribs of horses and cows; the Blackfoot Indian town of Browning settled in the high plains like an oversize, unkempt Easter basket with its turquoise, pink, and yellow ramshackle houses&#x2014;as if colorful paint were all it took to lift one out of poverty. Stray dogs ran amuck, and I couldn&#x2019;t tell if they were neglected or if they were contented community pets wandering around and being fed by local business owners and residents. It gave me an unsettled feeling&#x2014;that the new life I was stepping into was unprotected, not propped up by the busy cacophony of city life.<br> <br>But when I glimpsed the Great Divide, the way the mountains heaved out of the brown prairies toward the expansive sky both warned and comforted me. I&#x2019;d never seen anything like it, anything so stunning and dramatic, so separate from my sense of everyday city life. Is this why people went west, because the mountains bucking up to kiss the expansive sky made you feel as if you could have a fresh start or reach your highest dreams? Maybe, I had thought, I could grow accustomed to a place with such striking scenery, a place with buildings no higher than two stories and people with unsuspicious eyes.<br> <br>It was in Montana that I met that nine-year-old shooter, Reeve Landon, when he was twenty-nine and I was twenty-eight, and he had suspicious eyes. We began dating, and when I brought up the incident, he said, &#x201c;I figured you&#x2019;d find out. Not because you&#x2019;re FBI, but because anyone googling my name would find out. It&#x2019;s not really a secret. I just don&#x2019;t like to bring it up every time I meet someone.&#x201d; Reeve then recounted to me the incident that made him one of the unlucky children whose tragedies altered Florida&#x2019;s gun laws in the late 1980s.<br> <br>Ten months later&#x2014;a year and a half after I had moved west&#x2014;over coffee in a Starbucks, he told me he couldn&#x2019;t do it any longer, it referring to our blossoming relationship. He&#x2019;d been thinking about it for weeks. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; he had said. &#x201c;I just can&#x2019;t, Ali. I thought I could, but I&#x2019;m not sure I&#x2019;ll ever be able to.&#x201d; He never said it had anything to do with what happened all those years ago, but I have a good imagination and I find myself going back to it&#x2014;running my mind over and over the story like a cloth polishing silver to make it shine clearly in my mind.<br> <br>The baby, though&#x2014;that was a surprise. I found out I was pregnant three weeks after Reeve told me he couldn&#x2019;t see me any longer. We had used birth control, but it failed. I kept it from him for a time. I was at my wit&#x2019;s end when I found out. It felt like I was being swept away by powerful currents spinning me around and around. I even thought about ending it at first, but I was twenty-nine and had already been bitten by the bug. I&#x2019;d been thinking of being a mother since my mid-twenties. I considered having the baby without ever telling him.<br> <br>But then I thought about how hard it was not having a dad present in my own life. Having an absent parent can take a toll on you. I used to waste so much time fantasizing about my father&#x2019;s turning things around and driving up at any minute, like a prince, to rescue me. Every summer, when the other kids were heading to the Jersey Shore with their moms and dads, I desperately wanted him to show up with his smile and his dark unruly hair and say, &#x201c;Hop in, chickadee. I&#x2019;m all better now. Let&#x2019;s go to the beach.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d wait every year on my birthday for him to arrive with a cake and presents as if I were starring in a cheesy movie, a lonely child sitting patiently on a curb in front of her apartment building. When I didn&#x2019;t even get a card, my heart closed up a little further like a dying daisy, knowing deep down that he&#x2019;d never change and that actually having him in our lives would be so much worse, with the chronic yelling and fighting.<br> <br>I decided that I could not deny the child growing inside me a father. Reeve may have a few issues, but he&#x2019;s not abusive or volatile, so I told him about the pregnancy. He was shocked, but had enough sense not to try to talk me out of going through with it. He offered to marry me, but the suggestion seemed pathetic&#x2014;an offer he made over greasy burgers and fries while we sat in a cheap restaurant with Kenny Chesney playing in the background. Deep down, I knew it could never work, even though I deeply wanted it to, so I said no thanks and we worked out a plan. Turns out, fear can be greater than desire.<br> <br>My daughter&#x2019;s arrival the following spring, a perfect bundle of beauty with a tiny head of fine, dark hair, compelled us to figure out a parenting plan on our own terms without legal assistance. I picked her name, Emily, and we decided that when she got old enough, Reeve would take her every other weekend, and I&#x2019;d have her the rest of the time. We also agreed that Emily would keep my surname and he&#x2019;d contribute what he could, when he could. I never cared about the money, though, and so far he&#x2019;s been pretty consistent, sending me a check every month. No paperwork or lawyers necessary. We never went through the nastiness that some couples go through when their relationship collapses. It was almost like we both knew we wouldn&#x2019;t last, and at the slightest provocation, we quickly assumed cordial, cooperative attitudes. Both of us probably thought we couldn&#x2019;t get too hurt if we kept things businesslike.<br> <br>Now we rarely speak other than to discuss Emily or her schedule or when I see him to either drop her off or pick her up from his place. It&#x2019;s possible to get over your attraction to someone; it just takes time and the ability to move the feelings to the corner of your mind, where they pop up only occasionally, similar to old acquaintances at the grocery store, sometimes welcome, sometimes not. It&#x2019;s not ideal&#x2014;coparenting never is&#x2014;but Emily, who is five now, loves to spend time with her daddy and his dog, McKay.<br> <br>So when I get the call from Reeve on a chilly early November day, I assume it has something to do with Emily, that he needs to reschedule his weekend with her for a work excursion, which irritates me because I know if he misses the little time he has with Emily, she&#x2019;ll be sad. But the second I hear his voice, I sense something is up, because he sounds a little breathless and worried.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d; I ask, sitting at my desk in my office in Kalispell. The day is cloudy and dim, so I have my desk lamp on and it&#x2019;s exposing every bit of dust on the black chrome-framed furniture even though I dust the damn thing all the time.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ali,&#x201d; he says after clearing his throat, &#x201c;I need your help.&#x201d;<br> <br>Help? Reeve Landon doesn&#x2019;t ask for help any more than I do, so I pause before saying more.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ali,&#x201d; he says again, his voice slightly rising, a trace of worry in the pitch of it, which is also unusual. &#x201c;You still there?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here. What kind of help?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I need you to go to my place. I need you to get McKay and take care of him for a few hours. Just until I c...</p><h2>Daring to Ask for More</h2><p>God longs for us to pray large, much larger than we do. In Daring to Ask for More, Melody Mason has shone the light of God s Word on the path to true revival Holy Spirit-inspired, daring, audacious prayer. I know this book will be a tremendous blessing to many. Doug Batchelor, President and Speaker, Amazing Facts If prayer is the key in the hand of faith to unlock heaven s storehouse as Steps to Christ declares, then Melody Mason s new book is long overdue. Daring to Ask for More is precisely God s strategic appeal to this generation living on the edge of eternity. Daring to Ask for More indeed! May our hearts be stirred up as never before to seek God through prayer as never before, while there is still time. Dwight K. Nelson, Senior Pastor, Pioneer Memorial Church, Andrews University Melody Mason s new book, Daring to Ask for More, is driving me to my knees. My needs are so great and my resources so few, what self-righteousness it is to pray so little. Thank you for that push!

We&#x2019;d been away so long, first in swampy country, then in a big city&#x2014;maybe called Foggy Bottom&#x2014;that confused me from the get-go. Is there time to mention the air in both those places before we really get started? Soggy and heavy: that sums it up.<br> <br>Where were we? Was it possibly&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. home? Yes! Home! Home at last! Our home&#x2014;mine and Bernie&#x2019;s&#x2014;is on Mesquite Road. Mesquite Road&#x2019;s in the Valley. Quite recently I might have heard that the Valley&#x2019;s in Arizona, but don&#x2019;t count on that. What matters is that right now I was inhaling a nice big noseful of Valley air. Light and dry, with a hint of greasewood and just plain grease: perfect. I felt tip-top. Bernie opened our door, kicked aside a huge pile of mail, and we went in.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said Bernie, dropping our duffel bag on the floor. I did the first thing that came to mind&#x2014;just about always my MO&#x2014;which in this case meant sniffing my way from room to room, zigzagging back and forth, nose to the floor. Front hall, our bedroom, Charlie&#x2019;s bedroom&#x2014;mattress bare on account of Charlie not being around much since the divorce&#x2014;office, with the circus-elephant-pattern rug, where I actually picked up a faint whiff of elephant, even though no elephant had ever been in the office. I&#x2019;d had some experience with elephants, specifically an elephant name of Peanut, no time to go into that now. The point was: somehow I was smelling elephants in the office. Had to mean I was on a roll. Chet the Jet!<br> <br>Sniff sniff sniffing gets your nostrils quivering real fast, a nice feeling, as you might not know, the human sense of smell&#x2014;even in huge-nosed dudes and gals&#x2014;always turning out to be shockingly weak, in my experience. Take Bernie, for example, and his lovely big nose, somewhat crooked, although he plans to get it fixed when he&#x2019;s sure no more dustups are in his future, which I hope is never, on account of how satisfying it is to see that sweet uppercut of his, followed by some perp toppling limp to the floor, all set for me to grab him by the pant leg, meaning case closed, closing cases being what we do at the Little Detective Agency. Little on account of Bernie&#x2019;s last name being Little. I&#x2019;m Chet, pure and simple. As for Bernie&#x2019;s big crooked nose: What&#x2019;s it for? Just beauty? Is that enough? I tried to think about that, got as far as: Why not? Hey! Beauty was enough! And of course Bernie&#x2019;s the most beautiful human I&#x2019;ve ever seen. Hold on to that fact, if nothing else.<br> <br>I sniffed my way over toward the wall where we&#x2019;ve got our safe, hidden behind a framed picture of a waterfall. We&#x2019;ve got lots of waterfall pictures, water being one of Bernie&#x2019;s biggest worries. Why worry, you might think, when we had bright green golf courses out the yingyang here in the Valley, sprinklers on full blast morning and night, making beautiful rainbows? A lovely sight, but not to Bernie. What was the aquifer, again? Maybe Bernie and I should go find it, put things right. Wow! One of my best ideas ever! The next thing I knew I was flat on my back, wriggling around on the elephant-patterned rug to my heart&#x2019;s content. After a while I thought: Why? Why am I doing this? I tried to remember, came up blank, stopped wriggling, and in that blank and motionless pause, I caught another unexpected smell, this time not of elephants but of Iggy.<br> <br>Iggy? Iggy&#x2019;s my best pal, lives next door with the Parsons. The fun we used to have! But that was before the Parsons&#x2014;a real old couple&#x2014;bought an electric fence that they never managed to work right, so now Iggy didn&#x2019;t get out much. And even in the old days, had he ever been in our house? Not that I remembered. So what was his smell doing here, not a faint, long-ago kind of smell by the way, but strong and recent?<br> <br>I rolled over, popped up on my feet, barked one of my barks, of which I&#x2019;ve got many, one or two that can tear the roof off, as Bernie says. The truth is he only said it once, but it led to a whole night of me trying to bark the roof off where we were, which happened to be a hotel&#x2014;possibly the Ritz&#x2014;where we&#x2019;d gone for a special weekend with Suzie, Suzie being Bernie&#x2019;s girlfriend, a crack reporter now working for the Washington Post&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which might be in Foggy Bottom! I came real close to figuring out something about the past. But no cigar, which didn&#x2019;t bother me at all. Once I chewed on a cigar butt, and believe me it&#x2019;s not something you&#x2019;d want to repeat. Although I did. And then again.<br> <br>Back to this particular bark. Not close to my loudest, but sharp and quickly cut off, sending a message. I was about to try it again, even sharper, when Bernie stuck his head in the room.<br> <br>&#x201c;You okay, big guy?&#x201d;<br> <br>There he was! My Bernie. Hadn&#x2019;t seen him in way too long. My tail started wagging, closed in on blur speed. The room got breezy, not sure why, but that breeze carried Iggy&#x2019;s scent. My tail hit the brakes in mid-wag, stood tall and stiff, and I was back to barking that sharp bark, eyes on Bernie.<br> <br>&#x201c;Going through some mood changes, huh?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Which I didn&#x2019;t get at all. I was about to bark one more time&#x2014;Bernie! We&#x2019;ve got a problem!&#x2014;when he took a gun from his pocket and moved toward the waterfall picture. We&#x2019;d had several guns in our career&#x2014;including the .38 Special, now at the bottom of the sea for reasons I couldn&#x2019;t remember even if I tried, which I did not&#x2014;and for a while quite recently we&#x2019;d been completely gunless, not good in our line of work, but that .45&#x2014;a big stopper&#x2014;in Bernie&#x2019;s hand meant we were good to go again. A big stopper, by the way, that I&#x2019;d taken off a perp or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or possibly a cop of some sort? I was wondering about wondering about that, as Bernie reached for the waterfall painting. A gun not in use belonged in the safe, where we also kept some papers, plus our most valuable possession, Bernie&#x2019;s grandfather&#x2019;s watch.<br> <br>Bernie removed the painting, spun the dial on the safe, put the gun&#x2014;but no. What was this? No safe? No safe behind the waterfall painting, but instead just a hole in the wall? Bernie went still. So did I. We&#x2019;re a lot alike in some ways, although the only one actually panting was me.<br> <br>Bernie lowered the painting, leaned it against the wall. He put the gun back in his pocket, all his movements real slow now, his gaze on the hole in our office wall. I could feel his thoughts. He was thinking his hardest. When Bernie thinks his hardest, the air feels like a storm&#x2019;s coming on. Then he gets an idea and you feel light as a balloon when someone lets go of the string. Feeling light as a balloon when someone lets go of the string&#x2014;Charlie, for example&#x2014;is the best. I waited as patiently as I could for Bernie to get an idea. All I knew was that Iggy couldn&#x2019;t be the perp. He&#x2019;s way too small, for one thing, and not much of a leaper. Leaping is my best thing, although I&#x2019;d somehow flunked the leaping test at K-9 School on my very last day. Was a cat involved? And maybe some blood? It didn&#x2019;t matter. That was how I&#x2019;d met Bernie, meaning it was the best day of my life, except for all those that followed. But I still wouldn&#x2019;t mind a do-over on the leaping test.<br> <br>Bernie went to the desk, checked all the drawers. Then he walked slowly around the room, eyeing everything real careful, the way he does when we&#x2019;re on a case. Was this a case? If so, who was paying? The Little Detective Agency is the best in town, not counting the finances part. We&#x2019;d had some bumps in the road when it comes to finances. Don&#x2019;t get me started on Hawaiian pants or tin futures in Bolivia. In fact, I&#x2019;m never mentioning them again.<br> <br>We left the office and went through the whole house, starting with the front door&#x2014;not a mark on it&#x2014;and going all the way to the back door, off the kitchen. No marks on the back door, either. Bernie opened it, worked the lock a few times.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are we dealing with a pro?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>I had no idea, wasn&#x2019;t sure I understood the question. We walked out onto the back patio. The swan fountain&#x2014;pretty much all Leda had left behind after the divorce&#x2014;wasn&#x2019;t running. Bernie reached for the faucet on the side wall and was just about to start the water flowing out of the swan&#x2019;s stone mouth, when he noticed something shiny on the tiles of the empty pool bottom. He picked it up, and held it so we could both have a good look. A small but thick silver snakehead on a broken chain?<br> <br>&#x201c;Pendant,&#x201d; Bernie said. He took a closer look at the edge of the pool, bent over, and pointed to a reddish patch on a blue tile, although I can&#x2019;t be trusted when it comes to red, according to Bernie, so skip this part. &#x201c;See what happened here? Dude doesn&#x2019;t see the fountain&#x2014;meaning nighttime and maybe not a pro after all&#x2014;falls in, scrapes off some skin, loses the pendant. On the way out or the way in? I&#x2019;m thinking the way in. On the way out he&#x2019;d have the safe, and a dropped safe leaves marks. So, not a pro, plus no sign of forced entry.&#x201d; Bernie rose. &#x201c;Meaning he had a key.&#x201d; He gazed at the silver snakehead&#x2014;who would want that around his neck?&#x2014;and the heavy broken chain lying on his palm. &#x201c;Yeah. He for sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>&#x201c;Leda?&#x201d; Bernie said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s me.&#x201d;<br> <br>We were back in the kitchen. Leda came over the speaker. &#x201c;I recognize the voice,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh, right. It hasn&#x2019;t changed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What does?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry? Not quite following you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My point exactly.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bernie laughed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re in a good mood.&#x201d;<br> <br>Silence.<br> <br>&#x201c;The thing is, we&#x2019;re back,&#x201d; Bernie said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know that. You texted me an hour ago. I&#x2019;ll bring Charlie over Saturday morning, as agreed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Right. Good. Thanks. But that&#x2019;s not why I called.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I was wondering if you still had a key to the place.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your place?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Um, yeah.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Another one, you mean?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You sound a little slow today, Bernie.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bernie&#x2019;s voice got a bit edgy. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just trying to find out about the key.&#x201d;<br> <br>Leda&#x2019;s voice got even edgier. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m not in the mood for one of your blamefests. I humbly apologize for my indiscretion, but I had no idea I even still had a key until last week. I was sending some things over for the homeless, and the stupid thing fell out of an old Gucci bag. I drove by to drop it off with Mr. Parsons. That&#x2019;s the only key I had. Unknowingly, as I&#x2019;m trying to make clear.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why him?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. Parsons? One&#x2014;he was outside. Two&#x2014;I&#x2019;d tried your slot, but it was blocked by the mountain of mail in the hall. Three&#x2014;if you don&#x2019;t trust Mr. Parsons, you&#x2019;ve got paranoia issues.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, okay, I was just&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Click.<br> <br>Bernie looked at me. I looked at him. &#x201c;Started well but cratered fast,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Where do I go wrong?&#x201d;<br> <br>Bernie going wrong? That made no sense to me. I pressed my head against his leg, pressed my very hardest. It was all I could think of to do. Bernie recovered his balance in a flash. He&#x2019;s quick on his feet, just another wonderful thing about him.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>We went over to the Parsonses&#x2019; house. &#x201c;Wow!&#x201d; Bernie said. &#x201c;This is new.&#x201d; A big saguaro stood in the Parsonses&#x2019; front yard, freshly dug earth piled around the base. I&#x2019;m not a fan of saguaros, especially the kind that look like giant green men, such as this one. I laid my mark on it in my quickest and most efficient manner, and we walked to the front door.<br> <br>Bernie knocked. Right away I heard Iggy start up on the other side. How I&#x2019;d missed that amazingly high-pitched yip-yip-yip yip-yip-yip, a yip-yip-yipping Iggy could sustain all night if he wanted, and he often did! But now it was saying Welcome home, buddy! Let&#x2019;s do something fun! Like dig up old man Heydrich&#x2019;s lawn, old man Heydrich being our neighbor on the other side. Dig it up so it stayed that way! What a brilliant idea, especially coming from Iggy.<br> <br>&#x201c;Chet! What do you think you&#x2019;re doing?&#x201d;<br> <br>Uh-oh. Possibly standing on my back legs, pawing at the door? Maybe more like clawing into it, somewhat deeply? If that was really happening, I got it under control and pronto. If you&#x2019;d looked, you&#x2019;d have seen me standing silent and still beside Bernie, like a good citizen, whatever that happened to be. You&#x2019;d have thought I&#x2019;d been like that the whole time. And&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and hadn&#x2019;t I? Hey! You&#x2019;d have been right! And me, too! Which made me like you! What a day I was having, and it had hardly begun! It was great to be home.<br> <br>Stump stump stump. That was the sound of Mr. Parsons on his walker, stumping toward the door. Stumping mixed with yipping in a way I found quite pleasant. Then came some grunting, the grunting of an old dude bending down to do something, and after that the door opened. Not much, but enough for Iggy to shoot through. Iggy! My best pal. We bounced off each other, Iggy spinning high in the air, and took off for parts unknown&#x2014;my favorite kind of parts!&#x2014;ears flat back from the wind we were making with our own speed, knocking over this and that, chasing every living&#x2014;But no. None of that happened, except Iggy shooting through and bouncing off me. Why? Because Iggy was on a leash. A leash in the house? I&#x2019;d never heard of such a thing. And even so, it almost didn&#x2019;t matter because the leash slipped from old Mr. Parsons&#x2019;s hand. But Bernie grabbed it, and Iggy came to a sudden halt, hanging in midair for what seemed like the longest time, before thumping back down.<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh, sorry to bother you, Daniel,&#x201d; Bernie said.<br> <br>&#x201c;No bother,&#x201d; said Mr. Parsons. &#x201c;Nice to see you back. Read a rather hair-raising account of your recent adventures in the Sunday paper.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know how they exaggerate,&#x201d; Bernie said. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t amount to much.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice to see you anyhow.&#x201d;<br> <br>And it was nice to see old Mr. Parsons. Was he getting skinnier? His shirt, buttoned to the neck, hung kind of loose on him. So did his long pants. His feet were bare, nice broad feet I&#x2019;d always liked. I was considering giving them a quick lick when he said, &#x201c;Anything I can do for you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Actually,&#x201d; Bernie said, getting a tighter grip on the leash, Iggy&#x2019;s stubby legs now churning at top speed, although he was going nowhere, &#x201c;I was hoping to pick up the key Leda left with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure thing,&#x201d; Mr. Parsons said. &#x201c;Come on in.&#x201d;<br> <br>We entered the Parsonses&#x2019; front hall, me first, after a little confusion in the doorway. Bernie tugged Iggy in after him and closed the door. Meanwhile, Mr. Parsons went to a small corner desk and opened the front drawer.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s funny,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I know I put it here.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Family That Couldn&#39;t Sleep: A Medical Mystery</h2><p>For two hundred years a noble Venetian family has suffered from an inherited disease that strikes their members in middle age, stealing their sleep, eating holes in their brains, and ending their lives in a matter of months. In Papua New Guinea, a primitive tribe is nearly obliterated by a sickness whose chief symptom is uncontrollable laughter. Across Europe, millions of sheep rub their fleeces raw before collapsing. In England, cows attack their owners in the milking parlors, while in the American West, thousands of deer starve to death in fields full of grass.<br><br>What these strange conditions&#x2013;including fatal familial insomnia, kuru, scrapie, and mad cow disease&#x2013;share is their cause: prions. Prions are ordinary proteins that sometimes go wrong, resulting in neurological illnesses that are always fatal. Even more mysterious and frightening, prions are almost impossible to destroy because they are not alive and have no DNA&#x2013;and the diseases they bring are now spreading around the world.<br><br>In <i>The Family That Couldn&#x2019;t Sleep</i>, essayist and journalist D. T. Max tells the spellbinding story of the prion&#x2019;s hidden past and deadly future. Through exclusive interviews and original archival research, Max explains this story&#x2019;s connection to human greed and ambition&#x2013;from the Prussian chemist Justus von Liebig, who made cattle meatier by feeding them the flesh of other cows, to New Guinean natives whose custom of eating the brains of the dead nearly wiped them out. The biologists who have investigated these afflictions are just as extraordinary&#x2013;for example, Daniel Carleton Gajdusek, a self-described <br>&#x201c;pedagogic pedophiliac pediatrician&#x201d; who cracked kuru and won the Nobel Prize, and another Nobel winner, Stanley Prusiner, a driven, feared self-promoter who identified the key protein that revolutionized prion study.<br><br>With remarkable precision, grace, and sympathy, Max&#x2013;who himself suffers from an inherited neurological illness&#x2013;explores maladies that have tormented humanity for centuries and gives reason to hope that someday cures will be found. And he eloquently demonstrates that in our relationship to nature and these ailments, we have been our own worst enemy.<br><br>Advance praise<br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Family that Couldn&#x2019;t Sleep</i> is a riveting detective story that plumbs one of the deepest mysteries of biology. The story takes the reader from the torments of an Italian family cursed with sleeplessness to the mad cows of England (and, now, America), following an unlikely trail of misfolded proteins. D. T.

Throw all those other &#x201c;Mad Cow&#x201d; books in the trash: This is the book to read about prions&#x2013;or whatever you want to call them.

The cause of his death was &#x201c;an organic defect of the heart&#x2019;s sack&#x201d;&#x2014;or so contemporary parish records state. In truth no one would have known for sure what he suffered from and we can&#x2019;t know either. But priests ordinarily only wrote detailed descriptions of diseases when what they saw was noteworthy, and it is intriguing that the description of the doctor&#x2019;s illness in the parish book is one of the longest of the year.<br> &nbsp;<br> The entry records that the deceased suffered for more than a year from &#x201c;intermittent difficulty in breathing&#x201d; and adds that he was bedridden and &#x201c;totally paralyzed for two months&#x201d; before his death. Many of the doctor&#x2019;s descendants would experience similar symptoms in the course of dying from fatal familial insomnia, suggesting that the Venetian doctor may have been the earliest recorded case of a disease that has gone on to torment his relatives for more than two centuries.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Mid-eighteenth-century Venice was a place of gaiety and vice. The city always had a fairy-tale aspect, but until the seventeenth century its irreality was checked by an appetite for business. Venice stood at the crossroads of east and west, Asia and Europe, and it avidly cashed in on its location. But with the colonization of the Americas, trade turned the other way&#x2014;across the Atlantic&#x2014;and Venice began spending down its inheritance. Goethe, visiting the city in 1786, noted that the Venetians&#x2019; lagoon was silting up, their trade &#x201c;declining, their political power dwindling...Venice, like everything else that has a phenomenal existence, is subject to Time.&#x201d; The end was near, and everyone there knew it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Venice&#x2019;s fall, though, was the time of its greatest opulence. This was the era of Casanova&#x2019;s wanton memoirs and the splendid Venetian regattas and processions painted by Canaletto and Francesco Guardi. One story may help to convey the moment: in 1709, there was a ball at the home of a Venetian noble in honor of the king of Denmark, Frederick IV. As the king danced with one of the guests, a newly married noblewoman named Caterina Quirini, his buckle caught a string of pearls that adorned the belt of her dress, scattering them on the floor. The lady paid them no mind. The king was about to bend down to retrieve the pearls, whereupon her husband stood up, walked across the dance floor, and crushed them under his feet, while his wife danced on.<br> &nbsp;<br> Venice was a hereditary oligarchy. Its ruling class&#x2014;its doges, procurators, and ambassadors&#x2014;were drawn from two hundred families whose names, like that of the Quirini, had been inscribed in a &#x201c;book of nobility&#x201d; in the early fourteenth century. The Venetian doctor descended from one of these patrician families, great merchants and secretaries of state, whose surname adorned one of the central squares of the city. Though he was not himself entitled to wear the red toga that indicated patrician status, he enjoyed many of the other privileges of high birth in the republic.<br> &nbsp;<br> The doctor had a three-story palazzo on a canal and a country home in the Veneto (both still standing today). The country house was in a town near the Piave River, a trip the doctor could make in three days, by crossing the lagoon by gondola to Portegrandi and then continuing in a carriage. In the country, on terra firma, a doctor of good family could play cards and chess with well-born friends, and supervise his gardens and the collection of rents from his tenant farmers, all the while staying clear of the infections summer brought to Venice.<br> &nbsp;<br> If the doctor did have fatal familial insomnia&#x2014;the idea has been suggested by his descendants in their search for the origin of their mutation&#x2014;he likely would have noticed his first symptoms there in the summer of 1764. His servants, seeing his glassy eyes and sweaty forehead, might have gossiped that a witch had hexed him, but the doctor would not have entertained that idea for a moment. He was a graduate of the School of Medicine at Padua, the best in Europe. For him, sickness was not a magical but a natural process. The scientific method was blossoming in the Venetian state, of which Padua was a part. Its secular saint, Galileo, had set out the goal for all to see. &#x201c;Science,&#x201d; he had written, could be found &#x201c;in a huge book that stands always open before our eyes&#x2014;I mean the universe.&#x201d; To read it, though, you needed to understand the language it was written in: &#x201c;the language is mathematics.&#x201d; A physician&#x2019;s job, then, was to substitute exact observation for speculation, to look with vision unclouded by metaphysics or theology.<br> &nbsp;<br> The sleepless doctor could trace his medical pedigree directly to Galileo. Galileo had taught the monk Castell, who had taught Borelli, who had taught the anatomist Malpighi, who had taught Valsalva, who had taught Morgagni, who had taught him. They had many of them learned their craft in the Acquapendente in Padua, the most beautiful autopsy theater in Europe. Its wooden balconies rose up in a narrowing series of concentric ovals&#x2014;a &#x201c;high funnel,&#x201d; as Goethe described it&#x2014;from which the audience could look down on the human body lying in Euclidean splendor. Italian doctors were brilliant with their scalpels; seen from above, their work would have seemed to promise to the eager medical student the doctor had once been that if you studied nature hard enough, it would give up its secrets.<br> &nbsp;<br> That promise wasn&#x2019;t working for him now, though. He was no longer sleeping well and he did not know why. In the beginning, the feeling might not have been unpleasant&#x2014;he could stay up all night playing cards or maybe read Morgagni&#x2019;s famous comparisons of the body to a machine, published just a few years before. Just as any machine needed rest to prepare for the next day, so did the human. Yet the doctor&#x2019;s machinery seemed to be running nonstop. He was sweating more and more and his servants would by now be bringing him fresh shirts several times a day.<br> &nbsp;<br> If the doctor had turned to contemporary authorities on insomnia, he would have found little of use. Sleep, even now a mystery in many ways to science and medicine, was utterly obscure to the doctors of his time, who were still struggling to understand what went on in plain sight in the day. Indeed, the unsleeping doctor would have had to go all the way back to Galen, the ancient Roman physician whose teachings had dominated medicine until Galileo had challenged him a century before. Galen had learned most of what he knew about sleep from Aristotle, who had pronounced confidently on the question (as he had on most scientific issues). &#x201c;All things that have a natural function,&#x201d; he wrote authoritatively in On Sleep and Dreams, &#x201c;must, whenever they exceed the time for which they can do a certain thing, lose their capacity and cease from doing it, e.g., the eyes from seeing. Necessarily, everything that wakes must be capable of sleeping. For it is unable to be active at all times.&#x201d; Aristotle proposed that sleep was a byproduct of eating. After a person had a big meal the warm fumes from the process of digestion entered the veins, thence to the brain, and thither to the heart, the seat of consciousness, where their cooling brought about sleep. Galen, writing five centuries after him, corrected Aristotle&#x2014; the warm meal went directly to the brain, where it plugged the pores by which sensations entered and exited.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is unlikely the Venetian doctor took either Galen or Aristotle seriously. Both would have seemed speculative to him when compared to the certainties of the Acquapendente. Still, back in Venice now, to be on the safe side, he might have ordered his cook to produce bigger meals&#x2014;roast fowls and hams and sausages and fish from the Adriatic doused in the heavy French sauces that were newly in style. If so, the results would have confirmed his skepticism about the learnedness of anyone who had not gone to Padua. He would have sat awake in a chair, his stomach distended, waiting for the meal to warm his head. To help the process along he would have had plenty of wine, as well&#x2014;wine was particularly recommended for insomnia&#x2014;and then sat up through the night until the sun rose over the Lido.<br> &nbsp;<br> Or maybe he got up and went out, frustrated by the noise&#x2014;the hawkers and prostitutes and gondoliers singing to one another filled the nighttime air of a city in which, as the fussy Goethe noted, &#x201c;the people...appreciate volume more than anything else.&#x201d; If it was Lent, the doctor could have gone to one of the huge carnevale masked balls in the palaces on the Grand Canal, where, as a man of noble birth, he was always welcome. There, dressed as the medico della peste, he could have kept his vigil. It was the sort of wit Venetians admired&#x2014;a doctor in the black cape, the long white nose, and the face mask of the plague fighter. Dressed this way, the only evidence of his problem would have been the twin pinpricks of his eyes, peering from behind his mask. He&#x2019;d have come home to the sound of the Marangona, the great bell in Piazza San Marco, tolling the beginning of the work day, sleep still well beyond his grasp.<br> &nbsp;<br> The doctor would have asked himself whether he had caught something. Infection was on the mind of mid-eighteenth-century Venice. The city had a public health department well versed in the subject. They burned the bedding of disease victims and left their clothes out in the sun and air for a week to help neutralize the contagion. But what were they neutralizing? Here there was less agreement. The predominant view was that infection was an invisible substance carried in the air as smell. Thus the plague doctor costume of carnevale had a sponge at the tip of the long white nose, and workers who disinfected clothing for the Venetian authorities were also required to perfume the room and the personal effects of the deceased.<br> &nbsp;<br> But in the lexicon of disease there was no infection that corresponded to what the doctor was feeling. He was not just hot but extraordinarily anxious, like a horse at full gallop, sweaty and prone to a shaking that seemed to come from deep within. He was exhausted, falling in and out of a light, dream-wracked sleep. His servants might have heard him knocking on his own window, thinking it was a door, or spied him preparing the leeches for use, swishing around imaginary water in the dark glass jar where he kept them. The servants would have gone into his room to waken him, followed by his distraught wife. He would not remember sleeping, nor would he feel at all rested. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m tired&#x201d;&#x2014;&#x201c;Mi so straco,&#x201d; he would say in Venetian. And when the servants had left the room, to his wife alone he would express his deepest horror: &#x201c;Mi divento mato.&#x201d; Was he indeed going crazy? Was he destined for the ships of fools, those boats in the farthest parts of the lagoon where the Serenissima housed the poor souls from whom God had taken the power of reason?<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>MS.

Yet these disturbing images are at odds with a faith that most adherents--who now number over a billion worldwide--would regard as no less pacific than Buddhism or Christianity. Indeed, the word Islam in Arabic means "self-surrender" and is closely related to <em>salaam</em>, the word for peace. <br><br>In this thoroughly revised new edition, Malise Ruthven offers a balance, compact, and reliable overview of Islam. An internationally recognized authority on Islam, Ruthven offers essential insights into this major world religion, examining such issues as why Islam has such major divisions between movements such as the Shi'ites, the Sunnis, and the Wahhabis, and the central importance of the Shar'ia (Islamic law) in Islamic life. He also provides fresh perspectives on contemporary questions: Why is the greatest Jihad (holy war) now against the enemies of Islam, rather than the struggle against evil? Can women find fulfillment in Islamic societies? How must Islam adapt as it confronts the modern world? <br><br>For the new edition, Ruthven brings the text up-to-date, shedding light on some of the most significant changes in the Muslim world in recent years; from the emergence of al-Qaeda and the attacks on New York and Washington on 9/11 and the ensuing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, to the uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa.

In this ground-breaking book, Dr Nida Chenagtsang draws on his extensive training in Tibetan medicine and yoga to clarify major misconceptions relating to Tibetan Buddhist Tantra in general and Tibetan Buddhist sexual yoga practices in particular. Demystifying sexual yoga without depreciating it, Dr Nida provides an overview of the relationship between Sutric and Tantric orientations in Tibetan Buddhism, offers explanations of Tantric vows, initiations, and subtle anatomy, and explores both bio-medical and traditional Tibetan ideas about sexual health and well-being.</p><p>Speaking in a colloquial style as a physician, teacher, yogi, and parent, he addresses issues of sexual abuse, well-being and empowerment in a learned, down-to-earth and compassionate way. Aiming to inform and empower, this book offers vital context and instructions through which beginner and advanced students of any gender or sexual orientation can learn to engage with typically destructive and distracting emotions in a skillful way. Drawing on special Karmamudra teachings found in the Yuthok Nyingthig tradition that are aimed at practitioners without any prior training in tantric yoga, it offers safe and simple methods through which students can work with the raw energy of their desire and transform it into a source of blessings and benefit in their everyday lives.</p></p><p>Dr. Nida Chenagtsang was born in Amdo, in North Eastern Tibet and trained in Sowa Rigpa (Traditional Tibetan Medicine) at the Lhasa Tibetan Medical University.

She liked sitting outside on the wide, wraparound porch where the wind could touch her face. Sometimes, that small touch was the only relief she got from the relentless pain winding through her body every minute of the night and day.<br><br> Rain had given the air a clean, fresh scent. The world looked shiny and new, every leaf on the trees a vivid green or silver. Small birds sang to one another, hopping from tree branches to gnarled limbs. They were bright red spots of color, adding to the beauty of the compound. The property was owned by Tariq Asenguard, co-owner of a string of high-end nightclubs. He had a unique piece of property, and she would have loved to live there if things had been different. Tariq was Carpathian, an ancient race with amazing gifts, but they needed to drink blood to survive. She knew they were forced to sleep in the ground during daylight hours and only came out at night. If they didn't find their lifemate in time, many succumbed to the temptation to feel by becoming the vilest of creatures-vampire.<br><br> "Emeline." A tall woman with long, dark hair and forest green eyes waved at her from the play yard. "It's a beautiful day."<br><br> Genevieve Marten was gorgeous. Model thin. Tall with long legs that went on forever. Dressed in slim jeans and leather boots, she looked far too elegant, even in that attire, to be playing nanny to five children. Emeline knew Genevieve was independently wealthy and had traveled the world, yet she was as sweet as anyone could be, and she'd taken on the job of looking after the children when Tariq and Charlotte couldn't. Emeline was certain Genevieve didn't have a mean bone in her body.<br><br> "It is, isn't it?" she called back. For that one moment, Emeline felt normal, like she had a friend and they shared a joyous moment just because it was such a beautiful day.<br><br> As she waved, a long tangle of blue-black hair fell around her face and she pushed it back, vaguely thinking she was going to have to cut it soon. She'd always loved her hair, the one feature she thought was attractive about her. But it fell below her waist, and she was just too exhausted to take proper care of it. Merely lifting her arms to brush it, much less wash it, was becoming a terrible chore. She sighed and rested her chin on the heel of her hand, her eyes on the five children running.<br><br> She loved watching the children. She didn't really know true happiness anymore, but the closest she came was at times like this, observing them playing and laughing, seemingly carefree and happy. They were alive because of her deliberate sacrifice. The sound of their laughter, seeing them on swings and slides and doing normal things, was worth every horrific moment she'd suffered. They were alive. Traumatized, yes, but still alive and hopefully recovering very quickly.<br><br> "Come join us," Genevieve called.<br><br> Emeline wanted to join them. She even needed to, but she couldn't take the chance. She didn't think Genevieve would turn on her, but there were others . . .<br><br> "I'm drinking tea," she said. "You should join me. I baked cookies."<br><br> The children had become aware she was out on her porch, something she often did during the daylight hours, even in the middle of a violent storm, but never at night. At night, she stayed in the house, her heart beating too hard, terrified he would come for her. She knew Vadim was coming, it was only a matter of time. He whispered to her sometimes, when she wasn't strong enough to keep him out of her head. Those times were becoming more and more frequent. Emeline often had prophetic dreams. She could replay them over and over, changing small details in an effort to change the outcome of what occurred. Vadim had found her in those dreams, he had found a way to trap her and capture her. She escaped, but he was still with her in her mind now, impossible to get out.<br><br> "Emeline!" the chorus of voices called to her. Happy. Affectionate. Although she rarely left her porch, they knew she had their backs. She'd saved them more than once at a great cost to herself. They weren't fully aware of that expense, and she hoped they never would be. They were too young to bear any more burdens than they already did.<br><br> "Swing with us, Em," Danny called. At fifteen, he was tall and gangly, his form just beginning to show the promise of who he would become. Emeline knew he had great courage, as well as love for his siblings. He'd kept them together after their parents had died, and when the girls were taken by the monstrous men down in the labyrinth beneath the city, he had gone after them. She couldn't help but admire Danny.<br><br> "Not right now, but I have a plate full of warm chocolate chip cookies. And, Genevieve, I also have fresh cranberry and pistachio biscotti dipped in white chocolate."<br><br> Tariq Asenguard had taken the children in, become a foster parent of sorts, until the adoptions came through, protecting them with his friends and unique security system-just as he protected her. Emeline was grateful to him, but she knew she couldn't stay much longer.<br><br> Danny raced to the porch, leaned down and brushed the top of her head with a kiss, scooped up a handful of cookies and was back at the swings before either three-year-old, Lourdes or Bella, could protest. Bella was his youngest sister. Lourdes was the orphaned niece of Tariq's wife, Charlotte.<br><br> "Thanks, Em!" Danny yelled, stuffing one into his mouth whole. "So good." Both little girls immediately held out their hand for one, and Danny obliged them.<br><br> Despite his youth, Danny watched over his family with a fierce protectiveness. He was equally as protective of little Lourdes, Emeline, and Emeline's best friend, Blaze. They'd helped him when he thought everything was lost. He was a smart boy, indescribably brave, and he'd begun to emulate the Carpathian males who'd taken them all in. His hair was a little too long, because he was growing it so he could pull it back in a long ponytail like the Carpathian males often wore. He admired Tariq and even walked like him.<br><br> They'd been orphans living on the streets, trying to stay together, when the girls had been taken. Danny had refused to give up on his sisters and had gone after them, down into the underbelly of the city-a huge labyrinth of tunnels and rooms, a city below the city. Emeline shivered at the memory. She tried very hard not to think about it, to close the door on the horrors of what had been down there. She first encountered Danny in a dream and then, later, in reality when his sisters had been taken. Despite knowing what would happen to her, she had aided him in ensuring the safety of the girls. She'd seen her fate enough times in dreams, but someone had to get the children out or they would have died in that murky, stench-filled place of nightmares.<br><br> She understood street children; she'd been one herself and she knew how much they craved the stability of a close family. She looked around the huge complex, with the buildings, gardens and lake bordering one side, the high fence surrounding the property on the other three sides, and all the amenities the acreage offered. It was still a prison. No matter how beautiful, none of them could safely leave. Not even the children. Maybe especially the children.<br><br> "Cranberry and pistachio biscotti?" Genevieve put her book down. She'd gone to the bench under the tall oak where she could keep an eye on the children. "You made them?"<br><br> "This morning," Emeline enticed. She wanted Genevieve's company. She needed to feel normal even if it was just for a few minutes. Sometimes, if her focus changed, she could resist the pain longer, not be afraid for just a few minutes and pretend that she would have a life like everyone else. She needed that today-one of the reasons she'd spent all morning baking.<br><br> "You can ride my dragon," Amelia offered. She was fourteen, her body already developing into that of a woman's. Her hair was thick and often tousled from her continual roughhousing with her brother. She had beautiful eyes and a killer smile. Emeline adored her and the way she loved her sisters and brother.<br><br> Emeline knew it was huge to get an offer to ride one of the dragons. Made of stone, the five dragons-each with a unique color-sat off to one side of the play yard. They looked as if they were statues, just that. Nothing else. Emeline knew that each dragon had been made specifically for one of the children. For their amusement, yes, but mostly for protection. The dragons, crouched so lifelike in the massive yard, could suddenly come to life, spread wings and fly as well as breathe fire. Amelia's dragon was a striking orange and she loved it dearly. Emeline often saw her whispering to it, or circling the long neck with her arm and nuzzling it with affection.<br><br> Emeline sighed. She detested disappointing the children, especially Amelia or Liv, the ten-year-old, but she didn't dare chance leaving the porch.<br><br> "I'd love to ride your dragon, Amelia. He's beautiful, but I'm enjoying just sitting here, drinking tea and watching all of you." That was strictly the truth. "Come get some cookies. I don't know if dragons like them, but you can feed him one and tell him it's from me."<br><br> Amelia giggled and crossed the yard to the house at a much more demure pace than her brother. The Victorian was a smaller replica of the much larger one that was Tariq and Charlotte's home. That house loomed in the background, just beyond the play yard. Emeline always enjoyed looking at it as well. Tariq's main home was a sprawling mansion with the classic semicircular arches, corbel gables, rock-faced square towers, archivolt and transom windows in a ribbon pattern, all classic Richardsonian Romanesque.<br><br> Water from the lake lapped lazily at the shore. The sun poured down into it, so that droplets disturbed by fish and birds appeared as dazzling diamonds dripping into the water, causing beautiful rings that spread across the surface. Emeline always found peace in the sound of the water moving. Sometimes she wished she was like Blaze or Charlotte, no longer human but Carpathian, the ancient race of people capable of amazing things. With a wave of their hands they could move water, make it dance, keep that soothing sound up so she could concentrate on it rather than the pain racking her body.<br><br> Amelia threw herself into the chair across from Emeline's. She caught up a cookie and leaned forward. "Em, you do know if there's anything at all I could do for you, I'd do it."<br><br> God. She loved the children. They were all so amazing. Every last one of them. She was grateful she'd made the decision to go into that labyrinth, the chambers of utter horror, to get them out. She refused to regret that decision, no matter the price she had to pay-and she was paying it every single minute of the day. She forced a reassuring smile. "I know I look awful, Amelia, but I'm getting better." That was a lie. The pain was getting worse. Pain and fear. She kept a close eye on the sky. Sunset was fast approaching and she'd go immediately into the house once the sun dropped out of the sky.<br><br> "No, you're not," Amelia whispered. "You're not, Emeline. Please let Tariq or one of the others help you. A couple of the scariest ones are good healers."<br><br> Emeline couldn't help the automatic withdrawal, the way her body went smaller. She wrapped her arms around herself, as if she could cloak her body, make herself invisible. The ancient race could heal. She'd seen it. She wanted to be able to go to them and ask for help. Anything at all to stop the pain. She shook her head. "I'm fine. I don't need them."<br><br> "Are you afraid of them? I'd go with you."<br><br> Amelia reached out and touched her wrist and followed the line of bruising up to her elbow. Her touch was light, but it still hurt. Emeline forced herself to remain still. Amelia had been traumatized by the events in the underground city. She didn't need to worry about Emeline when there was nothing she could do. Emeline wanted her to be a child, although, realistically, she knew there was no going back for Amelia.<br><br> "It's such a beautiful day, isn't it? I love the rain, but this is gorgeous, everything fresh and shimmering new." She kept her voice light as she casually reached for her teacup, the action giving her a legitimate reason for moving her arm out of reach. When she settled the teacup back into its saucer, she put her hand in her lap, surreptitiously tugging on the sleeve to cover the bruising.<br><br> Amelia opened her mouth as if she might say something, but in the end, she just took a bite of the cookie. "These are still warm."<br><br> "Right? They're so good. I love them with ice cream."<br><br> Amelia scooped up three more. "My dragon's going to love these just like they are. Thanks. Any time you want a ride, let me know, and if you need me, Em, I'll come stay with you." Her gaze dropped to Emeline's bruised arm, not that she could see the discoloration, but she knew it was there.<br><br> "Thanks, honey," Emeline said, fighting the burn of tears. "Go have fun with your dragon."<br><br> Amelia hesitated, standing awkwardly in front of her, then she leaned down and brushed a kiss across her forehead. "You're important, too, Em. To all of us. You know that, don't you?"<br><br> Emeline tightened her arms around her middle, holding it together by a mere thread. She was going to have to risk leaving the compound to ensure Amelia's-and the other children's-safety. She knew when she made the decision to leave that she probably wouldn't survive. "Thank you, Amelia. Sometimes, I guess, we all need a reminder."<br><br> She wasn't as important as the children. They deserved a life, and they'd never had it. They were street children, living from one garbage can to another, the older ones stealing to provide for the younger ones. Huddling together to keep warm in the worst of winter. Here, in Tariq Asenguard's compound with the wealthy Carpathian as their guardian, she knew they finally had a home. She couldn't endanger them by drawing the worst evil imaginable to them.</p><h2>Human Behavior in the Social Environment: Perspectives on Development and the Life Course (New Directions in Social Work)</h2><p><p>The fifth edition of <i>Human Behavior in the Social Environment</i> takes students through the life course perspective to give a concise, compact treatment of human behavior. </p> <p></p> <p>The text also comes with a rich companion website that includes support materials and six unique cases that encourage students to learn by doing and to apply their knowledge of human behavior to best practices. </p></p><p><p><strong>Anissa Taun Rogers</strong>, PhD, LCSW, MA, is Associate Dean of California State University, San Bernardino Pam Desert Campus.

The main protagonists are the three major oceans--the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the Indian--which together comprise the majority of the earth's water and cover over half of its surface. Over time, as passage through them gradually extended and expanded, linking first islands and then continents, maritime networks developed, evolving from local exploration to lines of regional communication and commerce and eventually to major arteries. These waterways carried goods, plants, livestock, and of course people--free and enslaved--across vast expanses, transforming and ultimately linking irrevocably the economies and cultures of Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Americas. <br><br>Far more than merely another history of exploration, <em>The Boundless Sea</em> shows how maritime networks gradually formed a continuum of interaction and interconnection. Working chronologically, Abulafia moves from the earliest forays of peoples taking hand-hewn canoes into uncharted waters, to the routes taken daily by supertankers in the thousands. History on the grandest scale and scope, written with passion and precision, this is a project few could have undertaken. Abulafia, whom<em> The Atlantic</em> calls "superb writer with a gift for lucid compression and an eye for the telling detail," proves again why he ranks as one of the world's greatest storytellers.<br></p><p><br><strong>David Abulafia</strong> is Emeritus Professor of Mediterranean History at Cambridge University. He is the author of many books, including <em>The Great Sea: A Human History of the Mediterranean</em>.<br><br>"David Abulafia takes us on an epic journey through the open (ocean) spaces of the earth, tracing interconnections that brought together people, religions, and civilizations . . .This is history on a grand scale that is destined to become a standard work, written with a vivid clarity that ranges from dodos to Aztec lords, Rapa Nui to cod fishers in Newfoundland waters. By any standard, this is a brilliant historical achievement that leaves one in awe of the author's intellectual breadth." - Brian Fagan, Emeritus Professor of Anthropology, University of California, Santa Barbara, and author of <em>Beyond the Blue Horizon: How the Earliest Mariner Unlocked the Secrets of the Oceans</em><p></p><br>"Were my caravel ever to be becalmed, lost in some hot oceanic doldrum, I would hope to have David Abulafia's grand book on hand, both to remind me of sailors who braved wilder and colder seas in centuries past, thereby linking continents and archipelagos and civilizations together -- but also in the hope that just one of its vast multitude of pages might eventually catch the faint breath of a tropical breeze, and waft me up onto a shipping lane, and back onto my unwittingly abandoned course." - Simon Winchester, author of <em>Atlantic</em> and <em>Pacific</em>, as well as <em>The Perfectionists: How Precision</em> <em>Engineers Created the Modern World</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Bestiary 3 Pocket Edition</h2><p>Test your courage against the most infamous foes of myth and legend!

When child actor Ken Osmond stepped onto the set of Leave it to Beaver in 1957, he not only entered our living rooms, he homesteaded a permanent place in the American pop culture. The poster child for sneaky, rotten kids everywhere, he was the reference point for cautious mothers to warn their children about. And everyone in America knew an Eddie Haskell at some point in his or her lives. The amazing phenomenon of Ken Osmond&#x2019;s character is still going strong, over half a century after the show&#x2019;s cancellation. Even today, the name Eddie Haskell remains firmly entrenched in the American lexicon. Political foes from both sides of the ideological spectrum love to accuse their opponents of, &#x201c;acting like Eddie Haskell,&#x201d; and when Kobi Bryant argues a referee&#x2019;s call, tweets go out labeling him as an &#x201c;Eddie Haskell.&#x201d; Psychology Today Magazine has published articles about recognizing and treating &#x201c;Eddie Haskell Syndrome&#x201d; and Matt Groening created Bart Simpson as his own version of &#x201c;the son of Eddie Haskell.&#x201d; Now it&#x2019;s time to meet Ken Osmond, the man behind America&#x2019;s preeminent bad boy. A man who, as co-star Jerry Mathers said, &#x201c;Was the best actor on the program, because he was so diametrically opposed to the character he played.&#x201d; A devoted husband, father and patriot, he&#x2019;s a man who&#x2019;s been forever shadowed by Eddie Haskell, but whose own life, was even more amazing than the character he portrayed.</p><p>Ken Osmond is a former child dancer and actor who is best known for his portrayal of Eddie Haskell from the classic TV comedy, Leave it to Beaver. After the show ended in 1963, Mr. Osmond found himself to be hopelessly typecast and turned to law enforcement to find employment. His career, and his life were nearly cut short when he was shot 3 times at point blank range while on duty one night. Besides his iconic TV role, Mr. Osmond was the subject of urban legends. One was that he was the porn star John Holmes, the second was that he was the outrageous rock star Alice Cooper. Neither of these rumor were true. Mr. Osmond is retired today and manages his collection of rental properties.</p><h2>What We Can&#39;t Not Know: A Guide</h2><p><b>Revised and Expanded Edition</b><p>In this new revised edition of his groundbreaking work, Professor J. Budziszewski questions the modern assumption that moral truths are unknowable. With clear and logical arguments he rehabilitates the natural law tradition and restores confidence in a moral code based upon human nature.<br></p><p><i>What We Can't Not Know</i> explains the rational foundation of what we all really know to be right and wrong and shows how that foundation has been kicked out from under western society. Having gone through stages of atheism and nihilism in his own search for truth, Budziszewski understands the philosophical and personal roots of moral relativism. With wisdom born of both experience and rigorous intellectual inquiry, he offers a firm foothold to those who are attempting either to understand or to defend the reasonableness of traditional morality.<br></p><p>While natural law bridges the chasms that can be caused by religious and philosophical differences, Budziszewski believes that natural law theory has entered a new phase, in which theology will again have pride of place. While religious belief might appear to hamper the search for common ground, Budziszewski demonstrates that it is not an obstacle, but a pathway to apprehending universal norms of behavior.</p></p><p>This book is about the lost world of common moral truths -- what we all really know about right and wrong. I hope to achieve two things. The first is to bolster the confidence of plain people in the rational foundations of their common moral sense. This requires not only explaining what these foundations are, but also explaining why this common sense is under attack -- especially explaining how it is even possible for what we all really know to be denied, and why this doesn't mean that isn't really known. The second goal is to present the explanation in such a way that all of the people who think and write about the common truths can achieve a firmer alliance in their defense. This is necessary because the traditions which do affirm the common truths speak in such different ways that the unanimity of their affirmation is obscured. <p>My goal is less to present my own theory (though of course I have one) than to defend the universal moral inheritance of the human race. Because many are hostile to this universal inheritance, I expect to hit a few nerves. That may make it a bit harder than usual to know whether the more hysterical sort of reviewer is reacting to what I've actually said, or merely expressing fury against things like the Ten Commandments. For this reason, I encourage potential readers to read Amazon's samples from the book and decide for themselves what they think. Happy reading!</p>We are passing through an eerie phase of history in which the things that everyone really knows are treated as unheard of, a time in which the elements of common decency are themselves attacked as indecent. But J. Budziszewski, author of the acclaimed Revenge of Conscience, sets out to explore the lost world of common moral truths&#x2014;what we all really know about right and wrong. <p>Bolstering the confidence of plain people in their common moral sense, Budziszewski explains its rational foundations and why it is under attack. His bracing account prepares us to address the uncertain, the disoriented, and the self-deceived among our neighbors in a way which may bring them back to moral sanity. </p><p>"A gentle but incisive diagnosis of our daily evasions and rationalizations."

Is philosophy important? Why do I need philosophy if I have the Bible? Aren't philosophers simply engaged in meaningless disputes that are irrelevant to everyday life? Mark Foreman addresses these and other questions in this "prelude" to the subject. Unlike a full introduction to philosophy, this book is a preliminary discussion that dispels misunderstandings and explains the rationale for engaging in philosophical reasoning. In the first half of the book, Foreman defines the task of philosophy, compares it to other disciplines and demonstrates its practical value to Christians interested in developing a more thoughtful faith. The second half introduces the reader to logic and argumentation, the essential tools of a philosopher. Concise and straightforward, <em>Prelude to Philosophy</em> is a guide for those looking to embark on the "examined life."</p><p>Mark W. Foreman (PhD, religious studies, University of Virginia) is associate professor of philosophy and religion at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia. He is also the author of <em>Christianity and Bioethics: Confronting Clinical Issues</em>."This book is a helpful study of what philosophy is, how it is done and why it is valuable, especially for Christians. It is clearly written, with lots of real-life examples and stories, and will be of real value to students beginning work in philosophy." (C. Stephen Evans, University Professor of Philosophy and Humanities, Baylor University)<br><br>"Mark Foreman's introduction to philosophy gets it just right!

In <em>How the Internet Happened</em>, he chronicles the whole fascinating story for the first time, beginning in a dusty Illinois basement in 1993, when a group of college kids set off a once-in-an-epoch revolution with what would become the first &#x201c;dotcom.&#x201d;</p><p>Depicting the lives of now-famous innovators like Netscape&#x2019;s Marc Andreessen and Facebook&#x2019;s Mark Zuckerberg, McCullough also reveals surprising quirks and unknown tales as he tracks both the technology and the culture around the internet&#x2019;s rise. Cinematic in detail and unprecedented in scope, the result both enlightens and informs as it draws back the curtain on the new rhythm of disruption and innovation the internet fostered, and helps to redefine an era that changed every part of our lives.</p></p><p>Brian McCullough is a two-decade veteran of the internet industry and the founder of various web-based startups. Host of the Internet History Podcast, he was named a 2016 TED Resident. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.&#x201c;Brian McCullough vividly recounts the brilliant hunches, happy accidents, and fortuitous timing that converged to create the first 25 years of the internet era. Even for those of us who lived through it, it's astonishing to step back and realize the scale of the changes in human habits, communication, and society as a whole that have occurred in just one generation.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Chris Anderson, head of TED</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Mr. McCullough takes a broader view, showing how a handful of powerful companies&#x2015;all of them American, in his telling&#x2015;came to dominate web technology. In his story, the internet didn&#x2019;t happen only because of wizardly coding and cheaper computers. It also happened because of serendipity, failure, friendships and blood feuds.... Such historical tidbits help us see that today&#x2019;s tech titans didn&#x2019;t arrive on the scene as superhuman.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jon Gertner, <i>Wall Street Journal</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;For those of us who&#x2019;ve grown up with computers and the Internet, McCullough offers an insider&#x2019;s look at the unplanned and undirected romp that enabled the web to infiltrate our lives. He provides fresh perspectives on the famous names &#x2013; including Gates, Page, Jobs and Zuckerberg &#x2013; but, more entertainingly, introduces the lesser-known geniuses, like Sean Parker with Napster and Plaxo, as well as the academic godfathers, such as J.C.R. Licklider of ARPA. McCullough sprinkles his well-told tale with trivia nuggets, such as the first web advertisement being for a Silicon Valley law firm, and he shows how success resulted from some combination of timing, brilliance, and an uncanny awareness that consumers want unlimited selection and instant gratification. <em>How the Internet Happened</em> is a fast-paced and enjoyable perspective on our lives, as well as a compelling exploration for how humanity and computers came together in profound ways.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Richard Munson, author of <em>Tesla: Inventor of the Modern</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>How the Internet Happened</em> is destined to become the definitive text on how the web became big business&#x2015;and came to dominate every facet of our lives, from communication to commerce. Painstakingly researched and deftly written, McCullough gives us a comprehensive guide to the startups and CEOs who ushered in the internet age.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Brian Merchant, author of <em>The One Device: The Secret History of the iPhone</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Along with profiling the internet&#x2019;s key players, from Bill Gates to Mark Zuckerberg, McCullough provides an entertaining and informative technological history which computer geeks and readers interested in everything from sociology to business and media will relish.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Carl Hays, <i>Booklist</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The internet was not meant for the likes of us&#x2015;and yet we have it, through means that tech historian McCullough capably recounts in this wide-ranging history of the internet era. . . . Most of the individual components of McCullough&#x2019;s story, which closes with the arrival of the &#x201c;completely, conceptually perfect&#x201d; iPhone in 2007, are well-documented, but few other histories of modern technology connect them so fluently. In this, the narrative resembles Steven Levy&#x2019;s by now ancient Hackers (1984) and John Markoff&#x2019;s more recent What the Dormouse Said (2005); it compares favorably to both. A tasty, educational treat for tech heads and other web denizens.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews, starred review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A detailed and highly insightful overview of the influencers and ideas that have shaped the everyday technologies we take for granted, showing how the Internet has infiltrated our homes and lives to the degree it is today. . . . Tech enthusiasts and students of business, marketing, and ecommerce will benefit from the detailed chronicling of the early Internet days. Readers will delight in being reminded of long-forgotten platforms and in understanding how Internet evangelists, Wall Street, and the moneyed elite have shaped our online lives.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Library Journal, starred review</em></strong></p><h2>Sizzle: A Novel</h2><p>Whether it's exhilarating historical romance or spine-tingling contemporary suspense, #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Julie Garwood weaves magnificent stories of passion, adventure, and intrigue.

In <b>Sizzle</b> she burns hotter and brighter than ever, keeping the action and passion blazing till the incredible, unforgettable end.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Julie Garwood is the author of numerous <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers, including <b>Fire and Ice, Shadow Music, Shadow Dance, Murder List, Killjoy, Mercy, Heartbreaker, Ransom,</b> and <b>Come the Spring.</b> There are more than thirty-six million copies of her books in print.<i>Chapter One</i><br><br><i><br></i><br>They called him a hero for doing his job. And if that weren&#x2019;t bad enough, damn if they weren&#x2019;t making him talk about it.<br><br>Special Agent Samuel Wellington Kincaid received a standing ovation when he finished his lecture. He gave a quick nod then tried to leave the podium and the auditorium, but he was pulled back by another FBI agent who insisted that, as soon as the cheering and clapping stopped, Sam answer questions.<br><br>Knowing he should cooperate, he nodded again and waited for the audience of cadets and future FBI agents to quiet down. Like most people, Sam hated giving speeches, especially those concerning his work in intelligence, but this was a training seminar and a goodwill mission, and he had been ordered by his superiors to talk about his role in the dramatic capture of the notorious Edward Chester, a radical white supremacist and one of the most elusive criminals in many years.<br><br>Despite his reluctance, Sam had been scheduled to conduct five of these seminars around the country. He&#x2019;d already completed the first in D.C., and this one in Chicago was the second. Next week he would fly to Seattle for the third and then on to Los Angeles. His final stop would be at the naval base in San Diego where he would address Navy SEAL trainees. Inwardly, he groaned at the thought of three more appearances in front of inquisitive audiences who wanted only to hear sensational details of the capture.<br><br>This particular audience, however, also wanted to hear how Sam, while helping out on another case, saved the life of Alec Buchanan, a local Chicago FBI agent. The incident had happened six weeks ago, and since then, a few stories had been circulating. Agent Buchanan had been on medical leave, so they weren&#x2019;t able to get any facts from him. Before Sam was introduced to the crowd, he had been warned about their curiosity and the questions he might face. Was it true Agent Kincaid had gone into a blazing house to get Buchanan? How many gunmen were in the house when he&#x2019;d broken in? Had he carried Buchanan out seconds before the house exploded?<br><br>What happened was a matter of public record. Sam still didn&#x2019;t want to go into it, but now that he stood at the podium, he was trapped by a group who wanted all the gory details.<br><br>Yet the first question Sam was asked had nothing to do with the Chester case or Alec Buchanan. It was the same one that was asked almost every time Sam was introduced. &#x201c;Agent Kincaid, I couldn&#x2019;t help but notice your accent. Is it . . . Scottish?&#x201d; a female cadet asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes it is.&#x201d; Sam was accustomed to people&#x2019;s curiosity about his background, and so his answer was polite but brief.<br><br>&#x201c;How is that possible?&#x201d;<br><br>He smiled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m from Scotland, and that&#x2019;s probably why I have a bit of an accent.&#x201d;<br><br>The cadet blushed. Not wanting to embarrass her, Sam continued, &#x201c;What you really want to know is how someone from Scotland could become an FBI agent, right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have dual citizenship,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;I was born in the United States, but I was raised in the Highlands of Scotland. I did my undergraduate work at Princeton, my postgraduate work at Oxford, then moved to D.C. to get my law degree. I started with the FBI just after I passed the bar.&#x201d;<br><br>Sam evaded disclosing anything more about his personal life by calling on another eager cadet whose hand was raised, and for the next twenty minutes he was bombarded with questions.<br><br>Toward the end of Sam&#x2019;s lecture, Agent Alec Buchanan and his FBI partner, Jack MacAlister, slipped into the room and took seats near the rear door. Alec, still recovering from the wound to his back, shifted forward to find a comfortable position. Neither federal agent had seen Sam for a few weeks, but during the time they had spent with him in D.C., he&#x2019;d become a good friend.<br><br>Jack leaned toward Alec to whisper. &#x201c;He really hates doing this, doesn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d;<br><br>Alec grinned. &#x201c;Yeah, he does.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We ought to mess with him a little bit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What have you got in mind?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I could raise my hand and ask him a couple of questions about his sex life.&#x201d;<br><br>Alec laughed. A woman in front of him turned around to glare but changed her mind when she saw him. Instead, she smiled.<br><br>Jack lowered his voice again. &#x201c;How long is Sam going to be in Chicago? I forgot to ask when I picked him up at the airport.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Two nights. He&#x2019;s staying with Regan and me, but I had to promise him that my wife wouldn&#x2019;t cry all over him again.&#x201d;<br><br>Giving an understanding nod, Jack said, &#x201c;She&#x2019;s a crier all right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I believe your fianc�e shed a few tears at the hospital.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;True,&#x201d; he admitted. &#x201c;Will Sam join our poker game tomorrow night?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the plan.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can he play?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I sure hope not.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Man, listen to that brogue. He&#x2019;s really miserable up there. Should we save him?&#x201d;<br><br>Alec took a second to watch Sam, who was turning from one questioner to another, and replied, &#x201c;Nah.&#x201d;<br><br>The two agents thoroughly enjoyed watching Sam squirm in the limelight. Although he looked composed, it was apparent he was nervous because his Scottish brogue got thicker with each sentence he uttered. Alec also noticed that, during his lecture, Sam never used the word &#x201c;I&#x201d; when describing his accomplishments. He was humble, self-effacing, and impressive. As Alec had discovered firsthand, Sam was also as hard as steel and as unfeeling as a machine when it was necessary.<br><br>Sam was a skilled agent, proficient in gathering intelligence and carrying out missions, but his real expertise was in languages. Truth be told, the only languages he couldn&#x2019;t translate were those he hadn&#x2019;t been exposed to. As he had explained to the cadet who was curious about his accent, most of his childhood was spent in Scotland. What he had not mentioned was the fact that, as the son of career diplomats, he had either lived in or traveled to almost every country of the world. Languages came to him easily.<br><br>It was this linguistic proficiency that had saved Alec Buchanan&#x2019;s life.<br><br>The Chicago office had sent Alec and Jack to D.C. to follow a lead on a suspected arms dealer. A low-level informant was ready to give them the names of men who, for a price, could help them. While Jack headed off to get background information on a couple of people, Alec planned to make contact with the informant to gain his trust. There was no guarantee that anything would come from the meeting, but the D.C. office insisted on sending along audio equipment to record the conversation anyway. And even though the informant spoke some English, they thought it would be prudent to have a translator on hand.<br><br>What was supposed to be a quick meet-and-greet turned into a nightmare.<br><br>Sam Kincaid happened to be in the D.C. headquarters at the time finishing a case report. He was reading the last page on the computer screen when the director called him into his office. He asked Sam for a favor. An agent from Chicago was in town to question a possible informant, the director explained, and the translator, who was sitting in a van a block away from the house where they were meeting, was having difficulty.<br><br>The director handed Sam a file and said, &#x201c;This has all the information on the case thus far, along with photos of those involved.&#x201d;<br><br>Sam quickly looked it over and handed the file back.<br><br>&#x201c;The safe house is real close,&#x201d; the director told him. &#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t take long. It might even be over before you get there.&#x201d;<br><br>Fifteen minutes later Sam was sitting in the van with the driver, Agent Tom Murphy, and the translator, who introduced himself as Evan Bradshaw. Sam took one look at the perplexed young man at the console and summed up the situation immediately: rookie. Evan handed Sam his earphones and moved aside to give him his chair. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve been talking for about an hour.&#x201d;<br><br>Sam slipped the earphones on and listened for a minute, then turned around to find Evan sliding the van door open to leave.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey . . .&#x201d; Sam called.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re speaking English,&#x201d; he pointed out, trying not to sound exasperated.<br><br>&#x201c;I know, I know,&#x201d; he answered. &#x201c;But every now and then the guy says a sentence or two in a dialect I&#x2019;ve never heard. I can&#x2019;t make heads or tails of it.&#x201d; He got out of the van and, before he pulled the door closed, said, &#x201c;I think Agent Buchanan ought to pull the plug on this one. I hope you can understand what the man&#x2019;s saying. Good luck.&#x201d;<br><br>Only Murphy and Sam remained. For several minutes Sam listened to the conversation, which continued in English. Suddenly he heard two men burst into the house and begin barking orders in another language. Sam understood every word, but he only needed to translate one sentence to know that they were planning to kill the informant and Alec, then blow up the house. The charges had already been set.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a bomb in the house. Call it in and stay in the van,&#x201d; Sam shouted as he ripped the van door open. He hit the ground running, pulling his Glock from its holster. He leapt over a fence and raced across the yard. At the sound of a gunshot, he increased his stride and, using his forearm to protect his eyes, crashed through a bay window.<br><br>He landed on his feet and took in the scene all at once. The informant, blood oozing from a bullet wound to the head, lay crumpled on the floor. Agent Buchanan was slumped in a chair, his white shirt covered in blood. A gunman running toward the front door whirled around in surprise when Sam crash...</p><h2>Help My Unbelief</h2><p>Powerful reflections on faith and doubt by a leading contemporary evangelist. <p>Fleming Rutledge&#x2019;s first book, The Bible and the New York Times, has been hailed for its up-to-the-minute relevance to contemporary life. With this new volume Rutledge speaks directly to readers who are plagued by doubts and uncertainties about Christian faith. Among the host of challenging questions she addresses are: Doesn&#x2019;t everyone have their own idea of God? What if I&#x2019;m not very religious? Can we still believe in the Resurrection today? </p><p>Rutledge&#x2019;s approach has been described as a combination of pastoral warmth and intellectual fearlessness. She aligns herself with the struggling questioner as she faces the most penetrating theological challenges of our day. At the same time, she entrusts herself as a preacher in this new millennium to the explosive force of God&#x2019;s Word. Duke University chaplain William H. Willimon, in choosing one word to characterize her, selected &#x201c;biblical.&#x201d; Provocative, learned, and displaying the elegance of expression for which Rutledge is well known, Help My Unbelief offers satisfying answers for those struggling with faith and doubt in our modern world.</p></p><p></p><h2>Grass</h2><p>Sent to the land of Grass to find out how that planet has escaped the deadly plague that threatens the rest of the galaxy, a strong-willed woman makes some unexpected and frightening discoveries</p><p><b>Sheri S.

Grass</i>&nbsp;was a&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;Notable Book and Hugo Award nominee, and&nbsp;<i>Beauty</i>&nbsp;was voted Best Fantasy Novel by the readers of&nbsp;<i>Locus</i>&nbsp;magazine.Generations in the future, when humanity has spread to other planets and Earth is ruled by Sanctity, a dour, coercive religion that looks to resurrection of the body by storing cell samples of its communicants, a plague is threatening to wipe out mankind. The only planet that seems to be spared is Grass, so-called because that is virtually all that grows there. It was settled by families of European nobility who live on vast estancias and indulge in the ancient sport of fox hunting--although the horses, hounds and foxes aren't what they what they appear to be. Rigo and Marjorie Westriding Yrarier and family are sent to Grass as ambassadors and unofficial investigators because the ruling families--the bons--have refused to allow scientists to authenticate the planet's immunity from the plague. The egotistical Rigo sets out to prove himself to the bons while Marjorie remains wary about the relationship between the hunters and the hunted. She gains allies in her search, but invasion strikes from an unexpected quarter before the truth about an alien species comes to light. Tepper ( The Gate to Women's Country ) delves into the nature of truth and religion, creating some strong characters in her compelling story. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The First Step Bible</h2><p>A simple retelling of thirty-seven stories from the Old and New Testaments</p><p>Toddlers&#39; lives are filled with important &#34;firsts&#34; as they learn and grow by leaps and bounds!

Diego de la Vega's father is an aristocratic Spanish military man turned landowner; his mother, a Shoshone warrior. Diego learns from his maternal grandmother, White Owl, the ways of her tribe while receiving from his father lessons in the art of fencing and in cattle branding. It is here, during Diego's childhood, filled with mischief and adventure, that he witnesses the brutal injustices dealt Native Americans by European settlers and first feels the inner conflict of his heritage.</p><p>At the age of sixteen, Diego is sent to Barcelona for a European education. In a country chafing under the corruption of Napoleonic rule, Diego follows the example of his celebrated fencing master and joins La Justicia, a secret underground resistance movement devoted to helping the powerless and the poor. With this tumultuous period as a backdrop, Diego falls in love, saves the persecuted, and confronts for the first time a great rival who emerges from the world of privilege.</p><p>Between California and Barcelona, the New World and the Old, the persona of Zorro is formed, a great hero is born, and the legend begins. After many adventures -- duels at dawn, fierce battles with pirates at sea, and impossible rescues -- Diego de la Vega, a.k.a. Zorro, returns to America to reclaim the hacienda on which he was raised and to seek justice for all who cannot fight for it themselves.</p></p><p><p>Isabel Allende is the author of twelve works of fiction, including the <em>New York Times </em>bestsellers <em>Maya&#x2019;s Notebook, Island Beneath the Sea, In�s of My Soul, Daughter of Fortune</em>, and a novel that has become a world-renowned classic, T<em>he House of the Spirits</em>. Born in Peru and raised in Chile, she lives in California.</p>Whether you're curious about the Zorro of television and movies--and what instilled a passion for justice in him--or you just appreciate a good tale of adventure and fighting for the underdog, this book is a good choice. Blair Brown takes on the persona of the narrator, whose identity as revealed in the epilogue will come as no surprise. She is an animated storyteller who maintains a strong and steady pace and personifies the characters effectively with subtlety and sensitivity. Her use of accents is judicious and not overstated. The storytelling skills of Allende and Brown are superbly joined in this audiobook. J.E.M. Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award � AudioFile 2005, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Cirque du Freak : A Living Nightmare</h2><p>Soon to be a major motion picture by Warner Bros., &#34;Cirque Du Freak&#34; is the compelling saga of a young boy&#39;s journey into a dark world of vampires. Filled with grotesque creatures, murderous vampires, and an expected ending, the book contains &#34;a plot full of twists which leaves the reader hungry for more&#34; (J.K. Rowling).</p><p>Anyone who loves the humorous but hair-raising horror in R.L. Stine's Goosebumps series will devour British author Darren Shan's first novel with equal zeal. Some books are born with a surrounding buzz; this one even has Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling's stamp of approval: "Fast-paced and compelling, full of satisfying macabre touches," she writes. Warner Brothers will be making it into a movie, and the rest of the series is already in the works. Given all that, you'd expect a tour de force! Really, though, <i>Cirque Du Freak</i> is a thrill ride that will keep even the most reluctant readers turning pages, but will never take its place in the literary canon.<p> Darren Shan, author and narrator, sets the book up as a true story, warning readers: "Real life's nasty. It's cruel.... Evil often wins." Indeed, evil begins to win when Darren and his buddies find a flier for "Cirque Du Freak," a traveling freak show promising performances by the snake-boy, the wolf-man, and Larten Crepsley and his giant spider, Madame Octa. Darren and his friend Steve wouldn't miss it for the world.</p><p> So, Saturday night they sneak out to the old theater, tall and dark, with broken windows. "Every act you see tonight is real," croaks Mr. Tall. "Each performer is unique. And none are harmless." That's for sure. (A werewolf bites off the hand of someone in the audience, for instance.) Things grow very serious for the two boys when Steve not only recognizes Mr. Crepsley as a famous vampire, but professes his true desire to join him! To make matters worse, the spider-obsessed Darren goes back to the old theater to steal Madame Octa so he can teach her tricks in his room. (He does, with mixed results.) The plot further coagulates as Darren is faced with some terrible decisions about what to do to save his bloodthirsty friend Steve.</p><p> Readers may be too enthralled to notice some clumsy editing (the aforementioned bitten-off hand is later referred to as an arm, Darren stops dead in his tracks when he's already stopped, etc.). They may also not notice that the boys constantly use adult-sounding expressions like "his breath stank to the high heavens," though the book is clearly set in the 21st century. If this book gets under your kids' skin (and it probably will), they're in luck--we haven't heard the last of the Saga of Darren Shan. (Ages 10 and older, not for the faint of heart) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>Darren Shan lives in Ireland and has been fascinated with vampires since he was six years old. Cirque Du Freak is his first children&#39;s novel.

All but predicting the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center, Buchanan examines and critiques America's recent foreign policy and argues for new policies that consider America's interests first.</p><p>Anyone who has caught Pat Buchanan's television appearances, or heard his campaign rhetoric, will be surprised at his relatively evenhanded and thoughtful tone as he writes--often quite persuasively--in favor of the restoration of the political, military, and economic independence that largely drove U.S. foreign policy in the 19th century. At the heart of <i>A Republic, Not an Empire</i> is a well-written history of U.S. foreign policy beginning with the end of the American Revolution, going through the First and Second World Wars, Vietnam, and the end of the cold war, up to the superpower's involvement in the Persian Gulf and the former Yugoslavia. This section is bookended by, essentially, two very long op-ed pieces that lay out Buchanan's view of U.S. foreign policy: American interests should determine all foreign-policy decisions. <p> The twin foreign-policy goals of interventionism and free trade that seem to drive the Clinton administration's foreign policy are, Buchanan argues, the same pursuits "that brought the British Empire to ruin." Empires fall, he reminds us, through war and too many foreign commitments. With the end of the cold war, he suggests, U.S. foreign policy has become chaotic, driven by special interests; the sum of U.S. global commitments has become greater than the country's ability to defend them. In the end, <i>A Republic, Not an Empire</i> proposes, the only country the United States can completely rely on and trust is itself. <i>--Linda Killian</i></p>A theoretically coherent analysis but an unnecessarily flawed prescription. Political pundit and presidential candidate Buchanan embraces George Washington's advice to avoid foreign entanglements and argues that American foreign policy has become hopelessly overextended. The hubris which identifies vital interests in every nook and cranny of the world and allows us to believe we should shape other political regimes and even their policies according to democratic and humanitarian standards is folly flirting with disaster. No empire in history has survived such ambitious commitments; indeed, no empire has ever undertaken such commitments. Consequently, Buchanan advocates reining in our definition of national interests and undertaking a foreign policy much more independent of states and organizations outside our borders. Critics deride such suggestions as isolationism, but Buchanan appropriately points out that such charges are made to ``stifle debate.'' In fact, his approach is that of a true conservative, offering a perspective rooted in American tradition initiated by Washington and maintained until Wilson took us into WWI. Unfortunately, he forfeits the credibility built up through systematic logic and historical analysis by insisting that intervention in Vietnam was ``a legitimate war of containment'' in a book where the necessity of American participation in WWI and WWII is questioned. Perhaps this inability to overcome old wounds and rigorously apply his own foreign policy criteria reflects Buchanan's overriding concern with culture-war rhetoric on the domestic front. Certainly this must be the case in his attack on ``hyphenated Americanism'' and the great dangers posed by the loss of ``our American identity as one nation.'' Whatever one's reaction to multiculturalism, it's hard to see a necessary linkage between Washington's admonition against foreign entanglements and Buchanan's flirtation with xenophobia. Why this material is included in a purportedly serious discussion of foreign policy is unclear. Hopefully readers will look past the warts and approach the central argument with the gravity it deserves. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Billionaire Francis Reboul is taking in the view at his coastal estate, awaiting the arrival of vacationing friends Sam Levitt and Elena Morales, when he spies a massive yacht whose passengers seem a little too interested in his property. The yacht belongs to rapacious Russian tycoon Oleg Vronsky, who, for his own purposes, will stop at nothing to obtain Reboul&#x2019;s villa. When Reboul refuses to sell, Vronsky&#x2019;s methods quickly turn unsavory. Now it&#x2019;s up to Sam&#x2014;he&#x2019;s saved Reboul&#x2019;s neck before&#x2014;to negotiate with an underworld of mercenaries and hit men, not to mention the Corsican mafia, to prevent his friend from becoming a victim of Vronsky&#x2019;s &#x201c;Russian diplomacy.&#x201d; The dire situation doesn&#x2019;t stop Sam and Elena from attending glamorous f�tes where</p><p>Peter Mayle is the author of thirteen previous books, seven of them novels. A recipient of the L�gion d&#x2019;Honneur from the French government for his cultural contributions, he has been living in Provence with his wife, Jennie, for twenty years.Chapter One<br><br>Francis Reboul sat in the sunshine, contemplating his breakfast: a shot glass of extra-�virgin olive oil, which the French insist is so beneficial for le transit intestinal, followed by a large bowl of caf� cr�me and a croissant of such exquisite lightness that it threatened to float off the plate. He was sitting on his terrace, the shimmering sweep of the early morning Mediterranean stretching away to the horizon.<br><br>Life was good. Sam Levitt and Elena Morales, Reboul&#x2019;s close friends and partners in past adventures, were arriving from California later in the day for an extended vacation. They had planned to sail around Corsica and perhaps down to Saint-�Tropez then to spend some time at Reboul&#x2019;s horse farm in the Camargue and to revisit some of Marseille&#x2019;s excellent restaurants. It had been a year since they had seen one another&#x2014;�a busy year for them all&#x2014;�and there was a lot to catch up on.<br><br>Reboul put down his newspaper, squinting against the glare that bounced off the water. A couple of small sail�boats were tacking their way toward the islands of Frioul. While he was watching them, Reboul&#x2019;s attention was caught by something that was beginning to appear from behind the headland. It gradually became more visible, and bigger. Much bigger. It was, as he would later tell Sam, the mother of all yachts&#x2014;�three hundred feet if it was an inch, sleek and dark blue, with four decks, radar, the obligatory helicopter squatting on its pad in the stern, and not one but two Riva speedboats in tow.<br><br>It was now in front of Reboul, no more than three or four hundred yards offshore. It slowed, and drifted to a stop. A row of tiny figures appeared on the top deck, all gazing, it seemed to Reboul, directly at him. Over the years, he had become quite used to this kind of scrutiny from the sea. His house, Le Palais du Pharo, originally built for Napoleon III, was the biggest private residence in Marseille, and the most glamorous. Everything from one-�man sailboats to the crowded local ferries had stopped, at one time or another, for a long, if distant, inspection of Chez Reboul. Telescopes, binoculars, cameras&#x2014;�he was used to them by now. He shrugged, and hid behind his newspaper.<br><br>On board the yacht, Oleg Vronsky&#x2014;�Oli to his friends and numerous hangers-�on, and &#x201c;The Barracuda&#x201d; to the international business press&#x2014;�turned to Natasha, the statuesque young woman whom he had appointed his personal first mate for the voyage. &#x201c;This is more like it,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Yes. This is more like it.&#x201d; He smiled, making the deep, livid scar on his cheek pucker. Apart from that, he would have been a good-�looking man. Although a little on the short side, he was slim, his thick gray hair was cut en brosse, and his eyes were that shade of icy blue often found in people from the frozen north.<br><br>He had spent the past week cruising along the Riviera coast, stopping off to look at properties on Cap Ferrat, Cap d&#x2019;Antibes, Cannes, and Saint-�Tropez. And he had been disappointed. He was prepared to spend serious money, fifty million euros or more, but he had seen nothing that made him want to reach for his wallet. There were some fine houses, certainly, but too close to one another. The Riviera had become crowded, that was the problem, and Vronsky was looking for plenty of space and maximum privacy&#x2014;�and no Russian neighbors. There were so many of them on Cap Ferrat nowadays that the more enterprising locals were taking Russian lessons and learning to like vodka.<br><br>Vronsky took a cell phone from his pocket and pressed the single button that connected him to Katya, his personal assistant. She had been with him before the billions, when he was no more than a lowly millionaire, and she was one of the very few people who had his absolute trust.<br><br>&#x201c;Tell Johnny to come and see me on the top deck, would you? And tell him to get ready for a quick trip. Oh, have we heard back from London yet?&#x201d; Vronsky was negotiating to buy an English football team from an Arab consortium, not the easiest group of people to deal with, and he was becoming impatient. Somewhat encouraged by Katya&#x2019;s reply, he turned back to resume his inspection of Reboul&#x2019;s property, pushing his sunglasses up onto his head and adjusting the focus of his binoculars. No doubt about it, the setting was superb, and it seemed, from what he could see, that there were ample grounds around the house, undoubtedly enough for a discreet helicopter pad. Vronsky felt the first stirrings of what would quickly develop into a full-�scale lust to acquire.<br><br>&#x201c;Where to, boss?&#x201d; Johnny from Jamaica gave Vronsky the benefit of his wide white smile, a gleaming gash across his ebony face. During his time as a mercenary in Libya, he had learned to fly helicopters, a useful addition to his other skills with weapons and the finer points of unarmed combat. A good man to have on your side.<br><br>&#x201c;A short hop, Johnny. A little reconnaissance. You&#x2019;ll need a camera and someone who can use it.&#x201d; Vronsky took the Jamaican&#x2019;s arm and led him to a less crowded part of the deck.<br><br>Reboul dipped the final bite of his croissant into his coffee and looked up from his paper. The yacht was still there. He could see two figures in the stern busying themselves around the helicopter&#x2019;s landing gear before climbing in, and then the rotor blades began to turn. He wondered idly where they were off to, and returned to the news of the day as reported in La Provence. Why was it that, even with the season long since over, journalists devoted so much space to football players and their antics? He sighed, put aside the paper, and picked up the Financial Times.<br><br>The noise was sudden and shocking. Flying low, the helicopter was heading directly toward him. It slowed, then hovered above the terrace before making a couple of circuits around the house and its gardens. As it tilted to make a turn, Reboul could see the long lens of a camera poking out of the side window. This was unacceptable. Reboul took out his phone and tapped in the number of the chief of police in Marseille, a friend.<br><br>&#x201c;Herv�, it&#x2019;s Francis. Sorry to bother you, but I&#x2019;m being buzzed by some lunatic in a helicopter. He&#x2019;s flying low and he&#x2019;s taking photographs. Any chance of sending a Mirage jet over to discourage him?&#x201d;<br><br>Herv� laughed. &#x201c;How about an official helicopter? I can send one of the boys out now.&#x201d;<br><br>But the intruding helicopter, with one final swoop over the terrace, was now on its way back to the yacht. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t bother,&#x201d; said Reboul. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did you see any of his registration markings?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No&#x2014;�I was too busy ducking. But he&#x2019;s going back to a yacht that&#x2019;s opposite the Pointe du Pharo, maybe heading for the Vieux Port. It&#x2019;s a huge, dark-�blue thing the size of a paquebot.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That won&#x2019;t be too hard to find. I&#x2019;ll look into it and get back to you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks, Herv�. Lunch next time is on me.&#x201d;<br><br>Vronsky leaned over Katya as she connected the camera to her computer and brought up the first of the photographs. Like many rich and powerful men, his grasp of the details of modern technology was sketchy. &#x201c;There,&#x201d; said Katya, &#x201c;just press this key to change the images.&#x201d;<br><br>Vronsky peered at the screen in silence, his shoulders hunched in concentration. As one image followed another&#x2014;�the perfectly proportioned architecture, the immaculate gardens, the absence of close neighbors&#x2014;�he started nodding. Finally he sat back and smiled at Katya.<br><br>&#x201c;Find out who owns that house. I want it.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Emergence of Judaism: Classical Traditions in Contemporary Perspective</h2><p>This brief survey text tells the story of Judaism. Through the lens of modern biblical scholarship, Christine Hayes explores the shifting cultural contexts - the Babylonian exile, the Roman Empire, the Byzantine period, the rise of Christianity - that affected Jewish thought and practice, and laid the groundwork for the Talmudic era and its modern legacy. Thematic chapters explore the evolution of Judaism through its beginnings in biblical monotheism, the Second Temple Period in Palestine, the interaction of Hellenism and Judaism, the spread of rabbinic authority, and the essence of ethno-religious Jewish identity. Biographical sketches of key figures from patriarchs to prophets, and primary selections from the Hebrew Bible, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Talmud, and others, allow for a greater understanding of an ancient movement, and provide a solid introduction to the origins of one of the world's most influential religions. <br><br>The text's chapters will integrate key pedagogy, including introductions, study questions, textboxes, photos, maps, suggested readings, and a glossary and timeline.</p><p>Christine Hayes is Professor of Religious Studies in Classical Judaica at Yale University. She is the author of Between the Babylonian and Palestinian Talmuds (1997) and Gentile Impurities and Jewish Identities (2002)."Hayes has produced a readable, informative, and well-informed introductory text. With clear prose and focused pedagogy, she expertly guides readers through the complex thicket of conceptual issues that face scholars working on the reconstruction of the early history of Judaism. Distinctive features of this textbook include translations and commentaries on central texts, ample bibliographical guidance, and a thorough glossary." --Martin S. Jaffee, Professor of Comparative Religion and Jewish Studies University of Washington<br><br>"With such insights as that the Hebrew Bible is a document of compromise and with such descriptions as that the early rabbinic movement was slow, informal, chaotic, and marginal, this wide-ranging introduction is a significant tour de force.

The Great Inflation, argues award-winning columnist Robert J. Samuelson in this provocative book, was the worst domestic policy blunder of the postwar era and played a crucial role in transforming American politics, economy, and everyday life&#x2013;and yet its story is hardly remembered or appreciated. In these uncertain economic times, it is more imperative than ever that we understand what happened in the 1960s and 1970s, lest we be doomed to repeat our mistakes.<br><br>From 1960 to 1979, inflation rose from barely more than 1 percent to nearly 14 percent. It was the greatest peacetime inflationary spike in this nation&#x2019;s history, and it had massive repercussions in every area of our lives. The direct consequences included Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s election to the presidency in 1980, stagnation in living standards, and a growing belief&#x2013;both in America and abroad&#x2013;that the great-power status of the United States was ending.<i> The Great Inflation and Its Aftermath</i> traces the origins and rise of double-digit inflation and its fall in the brutal 1981-82 recession, engineered by the Federal Reserve under then-chairman Paul Volcker and with the staunch backing of Reagan.<br><br>But that is only half the story. The end of high inflation triggered economic and social changes that are still with us. The stock market and housing booms were both direct outcomes; American business became more productive&#x2013;and also much less protective of workers; and globalization was encouraged. <br><br>We cannot understand today&#x2019;s world, Samuelson contends, without understanding the Great Inflation and its aftermath. Nor can we prepare for the future unless we heed its lessons. This incisive and enlightening book will stand as the authoritative account of a watershed event of our times.<br><br>Praise for <i>The Great Inflation and Its Aftermath</i> <br><i>"Newsweek</i> and <i>Washington Post</i> columnist Samuelson is one of the rare journalists who debates politics and economics with a healthy skepticism toward conventional wisdom. Politicians would do well to study [the errors] the past that teach that choosing quick fixes only delays and worsens the inevitable.&#x201d;<i>&#x2013;<b> Booklist</b></i><br><br>"If you want to understand the economic events of the last half century, you should read. . . Robert Samuelson's The Great Inflation and Its Aftermath: --<b>U.S News &amp; World Report.</b></p><p>Robert J. Samuelson is a columnist for<i> Newsweek</i> and <i>The Washington Post</i>. He began his journalism career as a reporter for the Post in 1969. He is the author of <i>The Good Life and Its Discontents: The American Dream in the Age of Entitlement, 1945-1995</i> and <i>Untruth: Why the Conventional Wisdom Is (Almost Always) Wrong,</i> a collection of his columns. He lives in Bethesda, Maryland, with his wife, Judy Herr. They have three children.<b>Chapter 1<br><br>The Lost History</b><br><br><b>I</b><br><br>History is what we say it is. If you asked a group of scholars to name the most important landmarks in the American story of the past half century, they would list some or all of the following: the war in Vietnam; the civil rights movement; the assassinations of John Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr.; Watergate and President Nixon&#x2019;s resignation; the sexual revolution; the invention of the computer chip; Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s election in 1980; the end of the Cold War; the creation of the Internet; the emergence of AIDS; the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001; and the two wars in Iraq (1991 and 2003). Looking abroad, these scholars might include other developments: the rise of Japan as a major economic power in the 1970s and 1980s; the emergence of China in the 1980s from its self-imposed isolation; and the spread of nuclear weapons (to China, India, Pakistan and others). But missing from any list would be the rise and fall of double-digit U.S. inflation. This would be a huge oversight.<br><br>We have now arrived at the end of a roughly half-century economic cycle dominated by inflation, for good and ill. Its rise and fall constitute one of the great upheavals of our time, though one largely forgotten and misunderstood. From 1960 to 1979, annual U.S. inflation increased from a negligible 1.4 percent to 13.3 percent. By 2001, it had receded to 1.6 percent, almost exactly what it had been in 1960. For this entire period, inflation&#x2019;s climb and collapse exerted a dominant influence over the economy&#x2019;s successes and failures and much more. Inflation and its fall shaped, either directly or indirectly, how Americans felt about themselves and their society; how they voted and the nature of their politics; how businesses operated and treated their workers; and how the American economy was connected with the rest of the world. Although no one would claim that inflation&#x2019;s side effects were the only forces that influenced the nation over these decades, they counted for more than most people including most historians, economists and journalists think. It&#x2019;s impossible to decipher our era, or to think sensibly about the future, without understanding the Great Inflation and its aftermath.<br><br>Stable prices provide a sense of security. They help define a reliable social and political order. They are like safe streets, clean drinking water and dependable electricity. Their importance is noticed only when they go missing. When they did in the 1970s, Americans were horrified. During most of these years, large price increases were the norm, like a rain that never stopped. Sometimes it was a pitter-patter, sometimes a downpour. But it was almost always raining. From week to week, people couldn&#x2019;t know the cost of their groceries, utility bills, appliances, dry cleaning, toothpaste and pizza. People couldn&#x2019;t predict whether their wages and salaries would keep pace. People couldn&#x2019;t plan; their savings were at risk. And no one seemed capable of controlling inflation. The inflationary episode was a deeply disturbing and disillusioning experience that eroded<br>Americans&#x2019; confidence in their future and their leaders.<br><br>There were widespread consequences. Without double-digit inflation, Ronald Reagan would almost certainly <i>not </i>have been elected president in 1980 and the conservative political movement that he inspired would have emerged later or, conceivably, not at all. High inflation incontestably destabilized the economy, leading to four recessions (those of 1969-70, 1973-75, 1980 and 1981-82) of growing severity; monthly unemployment peaked at 10.8 percent in late 1982. High inflation stunted the increase of living standards through lower productivity growth. And high inflation caused the stock market to stagnate the Dow Jones Industrial Average was no higher in 1982 than in 1965 and led to a series of debt crises that afflicted American farmers, the U.S. savings and loan industry and developing countries.<br><br>If inflation&#x2019;s legacy were nothing more, it would merit a sizable chapter in America&#x2019;s post-World War II narrative. But there is much more. Declining inflation--"disinflation"--led to lower interest rates, which led to higher stock prices and, much later, higher home prices. This disinflation promoted the past quarter century&#x2019;s prosperity. In the two decades after 1982, the business cycle moderated so that the country suffered only two relatively mild recessions (those of 1990-91 and 2001), lasting a total of sixteen months. Monthly unemployment peaked at 7.8 percent in June 1992. As stock and home values rose, Americans felt wealthier and borrowed more or spent more of their current incomes. A great shopping spree ensued, and the savings rate declined. Trade deficits--stimulated by Americans&#x2019; ravenous appetite for cars, computers, toys, shoes--ballooned. Paradoxically, this prolonged prosperity also helped spawn complacency and carelessness, which ultimately climaxed in a different sort of economic instability and the financial turmoil that assaulted the<br>economy in 2007 and 2008.<br><br>The very belief in the permanence of economic growth undid economic growth. Initially triggered by falling inflation and interest rates, the upward march first of stock prices and then of home values induced speculative dizziness. People began to believe that prices of stocks and homes could only rise. Once that intoxicating mind-set took hold, prices rose to silly and perilous heights, leading to "bubbles" that burst in 2000 (for stocks) and 2007 (for homes). Home loans were extended to buyers with weak credit and with little or no requirement for down payment. The presumption that homes would always be worth more tomorrow than today provided a false sense of security to the lenders and rationalized credit standards that, with hindsight, seemed self-evidently doomed. When these "subprime" mortgages began to default in large numbers, the homebuilding boom ended, housing prices fell, financial institutions--banks, investment banks--suffered large losses on securities backed by mortgages, and the economy tipped into (or teetered on the edge of ) another recession.*<br><br>The significant point for our story is that the economy&#x2019;s present problems are yet another unappreciated consequence of inflation and its subsequent decline. The immediate cause of the housing collapse lay in lax lending practices; but the backdrop and inspiration for those lax practices were the expectations of perpetually rising real estate values that were sown in the climate of disinflation and falling interest rates. So it is with much else about our economic system that we now take for granted: The connections to inflation are there, but we simply refuse to see them. Take, for example, the way companies treat workers. In the first decades after World War II, government and big business joined in an unwritten alliance. Government promised to control the business cycle, to minimize or eliminate recessions. Big companies pledged to raise living standards and provide economic security for worker--safe jobs, adequate health insurance and reliable pensions.<br><br>But when inflation overwhelmed the government&#x2019;s commitment to manage the business cycle, the implicit social contract broke down. The 1980s became a watershed in changed corporate behavior. If companies couldn&#x2019;t raise prices, they would (and did) cut costs. Layoffs, "restructurings" and "buyouts" for early retirees became more widespread and acceptable. "Capitalism," a word that had essentially disappeared from common usage in the early postwar decades, reentered the popular vocabulary. The result was a paradox: Although the overall economy grew more stable after 1982, individuals&#x2019; sense of insecurity increased, because companies were less bound by the norms of earlier postwar decades to preserve jobs and shield workers from disruptive changes. The "new capitalism" controlled inflation in part by breeding anxiety that kept wages and prices in check. It also tolerated greater inequality-- growing gaps between the rich, the middle class and the poor.<br><br>Or consider "globalization": the thickening integration of national economies through trade, finance and information flows. Although we don&#x2019;t connect that with inflation, we should. Had the U.S. economy remained as in the 1970s, beset by seemingly intractable inflation and ever-worsening recessions, America&#x2019;s confident championing of globalization in the 1980s and 1990s wouldn&#x2019;t have happened. American leaders wouldn&#x2019;t have attempted it; and even if they had, no one would have listened. The restored stability and vitality of the economy, which stemmed from disinflation, empowered U.S. leaders to pursue internationalist policies. The same forces also gave the dollar a new lease on life in its role as the primary global currency used in international business. That companies and individuals thought they could rely on the dollar to buy and sell goods and as a store of wealth promoted both trade and cross-border finance.<br><br>Inflation is an example of how economics affects almost everything else, and the American story of the past half century can&#x2019;t be realistically portrayed without recognizing its central role. Much of what we take as normal and routine either originated in the inflationary experience or was decisively influenced by it. The great shopping spree, the reemergence of capitalism and increased globalization are three examples. But we have now come to the end of this period. Just what the next economic cycle will bring is an open question that, in some ways, will involve dealing with the sequels of many of the effects of the Great Inflation. The great shopping spree has ended. What will replace it? Globalization seems threatening to many Americans, as does the new capitalism. Will we shape these forces to our advantage or find ourselves whipsawed by them? Can we maintain acceptabl...</p><h2>Dark Flame (the Immortals, Book 4)</h2><p><p><i>In </i>Dark Flame<i>, Alyson No�l's most darkly seductive Immortals novel yet, Ever fights for control of her body, her soul&#x2015;and the timeless true love she's been chasing for centuries.</i></p><p>Ever is trying to help Haven transition into life as an immortal.

I am delighted that this moment has come at last. For this book is not only a permanent record of Hale's teachings, but the crowing achievement of a man who remains an unforgettable presence in the live of artists throughout America.&#x201d;&#x2014;Philippe De Montebello, Director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art<br><br>&#x201c;Robert Beverly Hale is a beloved teacher. He is a tall, spare, somewhat rumpled patrician of seventy-six, with black-rimmed glasses and an El Greco face. He teaches two courses, Artistic Anatomy and Elements of Drawing, at the Art Students League, on West Fifty-seventh Street, and his classes are a continual, almost legendary, celebration not only of the beauty and wonder of the human form but of Hale himself. Many people consider Hale the foremost teacher of artistic anatomy in the country, and perhaps the world. His classes are always oversubscribed, and students return year after year. When Hale enters a lecture hall or a studio, his students burst into applause.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New Yorker</i> Profile, June 13, 1977</p><p><b>Robert Beverly Hale</b> was Curator Emeritus of the American Painting and Sculpture Department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. For forty years, he was instructor of artistic anatomy at the Art Students League. He also served as Adjunct Professor of Drawing at Columbia University and Professor of Art at Cooper Union. Hale was the author of <i>Drawing Lessons from the Great Masters</i> and co-author of <i>Anatomy Lessons from the Great Masters</i>. <b>Terence Coyle</b> teaches figure painting and drawing at the Art Students League of New York and is the lecturer in Artistic Anatomy at the National Academy of Design School of Fine Arts in New York City.

Tour.</p><p>Warren Farrell taught at the School of Medicine at the University of California at San Diego, and also taught psychology, sociology, and political science at Georgetown, Rutgers, and Brooklyn College.The War Between the Sexes escalates considerably with this broadside attack in which men's-movement leader Farrell (Why Men Are the Way They Are, 1986, etc.) contends that the more subjugated sex is...the male. Farrell was on the board of directors of NOW in N.Y.C. until he realized that he'd ``been listening to women but not...to men.'' What he finally heard from men--and from his research into socioeconomic issues--is explosive. Through numerous short-take paragraphs, Farrell--armed with hundreds of thoroughly documented statistics and legal citings--argues that men are oppressed by several ``glass cellars,'' among them war (in which it's mainly men who die); suicide (``A husband whose wife dies is about ten times more likely to commit suicide than a wife whose husband dies''); and ``the death professions'' (``The Jobs Related Almanac...found that twenty-four of the twenty-five worst jobs were almost-all-male jobs''). He emphasizes that women live, on average, seven years longer than men, and that men's health issues, unlike women's, are basically ignored. He contends that women's net worth exceeds men's, and that economic power, if measured by spending rather than by earning, belongs primarily to women (``Both sexes buy more for women''). Farrell accuses government of becoming a ``substitute husband'' through welfare and through discriminating in favor of women in cases of murder, sexual harassment, and rape; castigates current laws regarding date rape and spousal rape; and claims that many accusations of rape are false. Finally, he predicts that the ``mythopoetic'' men's movement will become ``political and activist''--a prediction he seems to be trying to fulfill through this book. Farrell's claimed aim is to heal through rebalancing, not to wound. But as a veteran of confrontational TV (Oprah, Donahue, etc.) and other media, he must know that this work will cause far more dissension than dialogue--and that its very provocativeness may well make it the hottest men's book since Iron John.

It is organized into themes such as: perfectionism, conscious femininity, body, and finding one&#39;s own voice.</p><p>The second printing of <i>Coming Home to Myself</i> revives a popular and noteworthy book that does indeed bring women home to a more intimate connection with their feminine selves. Not quite poetry and not quite prose, this collection of quotes offers a series of bite-size excerpts from the writings of Jungian therapist Marion Woodman (<i>Leaving My Father's House</i>, <i>Dancing in the Flames</i>). As Woodman calls it, this is a "surprise child" that was born from the creative mind of artist and psychotherapist Jill Mellick (<i>The Natural Artistry of Dreams</i>), who initially imagined excerpting Woodman's quotes and illustrating them with her watery, Zen-like paintings. Woodman's kernels of wisdom are organized beneath 34 different headings, such as "Unmasking Myself," "Rites of Passage," and "Coming to Love." For example, under the heading of "My Body" a Woodman quote reads as follows: "If the dream says something is wrong with your body, check. Long before you do, your body knows when something is wrong." Or, "Give your body an hour a day. If it's not worth an hour an a day, there's nothing your body can tell you and not much else anyone else can do." Under "Reclaiming My Own Energies," we find this nugget: "A mother who is identified with being mother has to have children who will eat what she gives them and do what she wants them to do. They must remain children." This is the kind of book you can open to any page and find a quote worth pondering for a moment or a lifetime. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Poet, artist, and writer Jill Mellick, Ph.D., is the coauthor of &#34;The Worlds of P&#39;otsunu&#34;, and author of &#34;The Natural Artistry of Dreams&#34;.

The book is a tour de force that will set the standards on this important and complex subject for years to come. --Rondo Cameron, William Rand Kenan University Professor, Emory University<br><br>Thomas Sowell has produced a book that will compel every careful reader. . . to rethink their most confident views on matters of race and culture. . . the reader cannot help but find reasons to hope for a better world, culturally and racially, in this grimly realistic assessment. --<i>National Review</i><br><br> Sowell has no match in his breadth of knowledge on these issues. . . <i>Race and Culture</i> is ultimately a cautionary tale of human history with broad implications for current public policies directed at racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. --Linda Chavez, John M.

The gentleman riding beside the chaise surveyed the clouds placidly. "Faith, it"s a wonderful climate," he remarked of no one in particular.</p> <p>The grizzled serving man who rode some paces to the rear spurred up to him. "Best put up for the night, sir," he grunted. "There"s an inn a mile or two on."</p> <p>The window of the chaise was let down with a clatter, and a lady looked out. "Child, you"ll be wet," she said to her cavalier. "How far to Norman Cross?"</p> <p>The serving man rode up close to the chaise. "Another hour, ma"am. I"m saying we"d best put up for the night." "I"d as soon make Norman Cross," said the gentleman, "for all it"s plaguily damp."</p> <p>"There"s an inn close by, as I remember," the servant repeated, addressing himself to the lady.<br> "En avant, then. Produce me the inn," the lady said. "Give you joy of your England, Peter my little man."</p> <p>The gentleman laughed. "Oh, it"s a comforting spot, Kate."<br> The inn came soon into sight, a square white house glimmering through the dusk. There were lights in the windows, and a post&#x2014;chaise drawn up in the court before it.</p> <p>The gentleman came lightly down from the saddle. He was of medium height, and carried himself well. He had a neat leg encased in a fine riding boot, and a slender hand in an embroidered gauntlet.</p> <p>There was straightway a bustle at the inn. An ostler came running; mine host appeared in the porch with a bow and a scrape and a waiting man sped forth to assist in letting down the steps of the chaise.</p> <p>"Two bedchambers, for myself and my sister," said the gentleman. "Dinner, and a private room."</p> <p>Consternation was in the landlord"s face. "Bedchambers, sir. Yes &#x2013; on the instant! Polly, the two best bedchambers, and fires to be lit in them!" A serving maid went scuttling off. "Sir, the private room!" Mine host bowed, and spread a pair of deprecating hands. "But this moment, sir, it was bespoken by a lady and a gentleman travelling north." He looked slyly, and cast down his eyes. "But they stay only for dinner, sir, and if your honour and the lady would condescend to the coffee&#x2014;room? There"s never a soul likely to come to&#x2014;night, and "twill be private enough."</p> <p>There was a rustle of skirts. My lady came down from the chaise with a hand on her servant"s shoulder. "The coffee&#x2014;room or any other so I get out of this wet!" she cried, and swept into the inn with her cavalier behind her.</p> <p>They found themselves straight in a comfortable large room. There was a table set, and a wood fire burning in the hearth. A door led out into a passage at the back, where the stairs rose steeply, and another to one side, giving on to the taproom.</p> <p>A trim girl in a mob cap brought more candles, and dropped a shy curtsey to the lady. "If you please, my lady, should I take your ladyship"s cloak? Your ladyship"s abigail...?"</p> <p>"Alack, the creature"s not with me!" mourned Madam Kate. "Take the cloak up to my chamber, child. So!" She put back the hood from her head, and untied the strings round her throat. The cloak was given to the maid; Madam stood up in a taffety gown of blue spread over a wide hoop. She wore her fair ringlets en demie toilette, free from powder, with a blue ribbon threaded through, and a couple of curls allowed to fall over her shoulder. The maid thought her a prodigiously lovely lady and bobbed another curtsey before she went away with the cloak.</p> <p>My lady"s brother gave his three&#x2014;cornered hat into his servant"s keeping, and struggled out of his greatcoat. He was much of his sister"s height, a little taller perhaps, and like enough to her in appearance. His hair was of a darker brown, confined demurely at the neck by a black riband; and his eyes showed more grey than blue in the candlelight. Young he seemed, for his cheek was innocent of all but the faintest down; but he had a square shoulder, and a good chin, rounded, but purposeful enough. The landlord, following him into the coffee&#x2014;room, was profuse in apologies and obeisances, for he recognised a member of the Quality. The lady wore a fine silk gown, and Mr Merriot a modish coat of brown velvet, with gold lacing, and a quantity of Mechlin lace at his throat and wrists. A pretty pair, in all, with the easy ways of the Quality, and a humorous look about the eyes that made them much alike. The landlord began to talk of capons and his best burgundy, and was sent off to produce them.</p> <p>Miss Merriot sat down by the fire, and stretched one foot in its buckled shoe to the blaze. There was a red heel to her shoe, and marvellous embroidered clocks to her silken stockings. <br> "So!" said Miss Merriot. "How do you, my Peter?"<br> "I don"t melt in a shower of rain, I believe," Peter said, and sat down on the edge of the table, swinging one booted leg.<br> "No, faith, child, there"s too much of you for that."<br> The gentleman"s rich chuckle sounded. "I"m sufficiently substantial, in truth," he remarked. He drew out his gold and enamelled snuff&#x2014;box from one of his huge coat pockets, and took a pinch with an air, delicately shaking the ruffles of lace back from his wrists. A ruby ring glowed on one of his long fingers, while on the other hand he wore a big gold seal ring. A smile crept up into his eyes, and lurked at the corners of his mouth. "I"d give something to know where the old gentleman &nbsp;is," he said.</p> <p>"Safe enough, I"ll be bound," Madam answered, and laughed.<br> "It"s the devil himself, I believe, and will appear in London to snap his fingers under the noses of all King George"s men."<br> "Fie, Kate: my poor, respected papa!" Mr Merriot was not shocked. He fobbed his snuff&#x2014;box and put it away. A faint crease showed between his brows. "For all he named London &#x2013; egad, "tis like his impudence! &#x2013; it"s odds he"s gone to France."<br> "I don"t permit myself to hope too much," said Miss Merriot, with a smile at once dreamy and a little impish. "He"ll be there to lead us another of his mad dances. If not...I"ve a mind to try our own fortunes."<br> "In truth, I"ve a kindness for the old gentleman," said Mr Merriot pensively. "His dances lead somewhere."<br> "To lost causes." There was a hint of bitterness in the tone.<br> Mr Merriot looked up. "Ay, you"ve taken it to heart."<br> "Not I." Kate jerked a shoulder as though to shake something off. "We went into it &#x2013; egad, why did we go into it?"<br> "Ask the old gentleman," said Mr Merriot, the slow smile creeping up again. "He had a loyal fervour, belike."<br> Kate drew down the corners of her mouth. "It"s a pleasing image. He meant it for a beau geste, I dare swear. And we? Well, I suppose we went willy nilly into the net."<br> "I don"t regret it. The old gentleman meddled in Saxe"s affairs, but we came out of that net."</p></p><h2>A Word in the Hand Book One: An Introduction to Sign Language</h2><p>Basic teaching primer for Signed English. 15 topical chapters, each containing vocabulary words, illustrations, review, exercises, games, and assignments that students and teachers will find exciting.

Normally a haven of calm, for the next three days this sanctuary will be overrun by tipsy revelers as Winn prepares for the marriage of his daughter Daphne to the affable young scion Greyson Duff.&nbsp; Winn&#x2019;s wife, Biddy, has planned the wedding with military precision, but arrangements are sideswept by a storm of salacious misbehavior and intractable lust: Daphne&#x2019;s sister, Livia, who has recently had her heart broken by Teddy Fenn, the son of her father&#x2019;s oldest rival, is an eager target for the seductive wiles of Greyson&#x2019;s best man; Winn, instead of reveling in his patriarchal duties, is tormented by his long-standing crush on Daphne&#x2019;s beguiling bridesmaid Agatha; and the bride and groom find themselves presiding over a spectacle of misplaced desire, marital infidelity, and monumental loss of faith in the rituals of American life. <br><br> Hilarious, keenly intelligent, and commandingly well written, Shipstead&#x2019;s deceptively frothy first novel is a piercing rumination on desire, on love and its obligations, and on the dangers of leading an inauthentic life, heralding the debut of an exciting new literary voice.</p><p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, June 2012</strong>: Family reunions are ripe for farce and surreal events&#x2014;especially when you add a wedding to the mix. <em>Seating Arrangements</em> takes place over the course of a three-day weekend that culminates with the wedding of the eldest Van Meter daughter, Daphne; a wedding hastened by Daphne&#x2019;s unexpected pregnancy. Add in the grudges, longings, and lusts of the rather peculiar Van Meter family, which isn&#x2019;t entirely secure with its old-money status, and you have a weekend teetering on the brink of familial implosion. The relationships between characters are handled deftly, and each misstep the characters make feels as inevitable as it does realistic. The end result is clear: this is an author to watch out for. <em>--Malissa Kent</em> </p> <p><b> Write What You Wonder About &#x2013; An Exclusive Essay, by Maggie Shipstead</b></p> <p> &#x201c;Write what you know&#x201d; is easily the most frequently quoted piece of writing advice. When I&#x2019;m asked to describe my book (which, for the record, I&#x2019;m extremely bad at), I usually mumble something about a dysfunctional WASPy family having a wedding on an island, and people either nod sagely and affirm, &#x201c;Write what you know,&#x201d; or ask, puzzled, &#x201c;I thought you were supposed to write what you know?&#x201d;</p> <p> It&#x2019;s an odd window on what other people think I know, and, to be honest, I don&#x2019;t always know what I know. I&#x2019;ve spent seventy percent of my life in California, including years zero to eighteen when I lived in beachy, suburban SoCal and was utterly oblivious to the existence of New England prep schools and social clubs.</p> <p> Twenty percent of my life has happened in Massachusetts, including eight months on Nantucket, where I wrote the first draft of <em>Seating Arrangements</em>. (Let it be said that I <em>do</em> know about Atlantic resort islands, especially, and unhelpfully to my book, in the winter.) Miscellaneous, irrelevant locations get the last ten percent.</p> <p> Depending on how literally someone interprets the commandment to write what you know, here are some questions that come up: as a Californian, how much can I really know about upper crust New England families like Van Meters? I&#x2019;m not married, so how much can I really know about weddings? I&#x2019;m not a sixty-year-old man, so is it wise to write from the point of view of one?</p> <p> But I have an easy out. It&#x2019;s that I don&#x2019;t happen to be a believer in writing what you know. The idea of a world where people only write what they know sounds flat, grim, and unimaginative to me. I don&#x2019;t believe in writing in ignorance, either.</p> <p> Instead, I try to write what I wonder about. When I lived in the East, I wondered about the people I met who knew how to dress for garden parties when they were still in their teens, who had vast webs of generationally intertwined family friends, whose style of dress was crisp and culturally regimented and was in no way inspired by surfers or skaters or movie stars grocery shopping in velour sweatsuits. I wondered what it would have been like to go to boarding school, to use &#x201c;summer&#x201d; as a verb, to know how to sail.</p> <p> For a while, I thought maybe these people could be categorized and diagrammed as neatly and pleasingly as in <em>The Official Preppy Handbook</em>. Then I met my friend Bailey&#x2019;s grandmother, a formidable grand dame who was one of Jacqueline Kennedy&#x2019;s bridesmaids. At first glance, she seems like the distilled essence of High WASP. She has a gift for fun of the drinking-and-dancing variety, a plummy voice, memberships in clubs of the long-established and selective variety, a house on the North Shore of Massachusetts full of ancestral oil paintings and classic wallpaper patterns, and a house in Maine full of hardback thrillers and ingredients for Bloody Marys. But what I loved about this particular woman was her surprisingly fantastic closet, which resembled what might have happened if the wardrobes from <em>Dynasty</em> and <em>The Love Boat</em> had been shut inside the Copacabana to breed in isolation for several decades. Behind the classic wallpaper, she kept a pirate&#x2019;s horde of sequins, jewel-tone silks, shoulder pads, towering heels, heaps of bedazzled dresses and sweaters, and one very special zebra-print jumpsuit with matching belt.</p> <p> In the end, I set about writing a character, Winn Van Meter, who doesn&#x2019;t wonder much about anything and so misses out on a lot. I know him, even though he doesn&#x2019;t exist. He spends his life in pursuit of correctness and an illusory social status, but there are a few zebra-print jumpsuits, metaphorically speaking, lurking behind his staid exterior.

This gorgeous, wise, funny, sprawling novel about family, fidelity, and social class is the best book I&#x2019;ve read in ages.</p> <p> Beautifully set on an exclusive island off the coast of Cape Cod, Shipstead&#x2019;s debut sparkles with all the enticements of summer: you can practically smell the sea salt and see the ferries coming into harbor overflowing with weekend guests and their brimming bags of sunscreen and champagne. With an irresistible mix of wit and tenderness, the novel tells the story of what happens when the illustrious Van Meter family&#x2014;Winn, the obtuse and perennially optimistic patriarch; his wife Biddie, and their beautiful daughters Livia (recently jilted by the son of Winn&#x2019;s oldest rival) and Daphne (the bride, seven months pregnant)--plan a wedding at their beloved island retreat. Shipstead captures a family on the brink of implosion, brilliantly contrasting the novel&#x2019;s placid setting with the hilarity and chaos that ensue when Winn embarks on a dangerous game of seduction with his daughter&#x2019;s most lissome bridesmaid.</p> <p> Maggie Shipstead is a born novelist, and <em>Seating Arrangements</em> is both wickedly smart and impossible to put down, a true summer pleasure.</p><b>Maggie Shipstead</b> was born in 1983 and grew up in Orange County, California.

And while our perception may convince us that things are either solid or liquid or gaseous&#x2014;on the quantum level it&#x2019;s all just particles within particles&#x2014;it&#x2019;s all just energy.&#x201d;<br>I press my lips together and nod, his voice overpowered by the one in my head urging: Tell him! Tell him now! Quit stalling, and just get it over with! Hurry, before he starts talking again!<br>But I don&#x2019;t. I don&#x2019;t say a word. I just wait for him to continue so I can delay even further.<br>&#x201c;Raise your hand.&#x201d; He nods, palm out, moving toward mine. Lifting my arm slowly, cautiously, determined to avoid any and all physical contact when he says, &#x201c;Now tell me, what do you see?&#x201d;<br>I squint, unsure what he&#x2019;s after, then shrugging I say, &#x201c;Well, I see pale skin, long fingers, a freckle or two, nails in serious need of a manicure ...&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d; He smiles, as though I just passed the world&#x2019;s easiest test. &#x201c;But if you could see it as it really is, you wouldn&#x2019;t see that at all. Instead you&#x2019;d see a swarm of molecules containing protons, neutrons, electrons, and quarks. And within those tiny quarks, down to the most minuscule point, you&#x2019;d see nothing but pure vibrating energy moving at a speed slow enough that it appears solid and dense, and yet quickly enough that it can&#x2019;t be observed for what it truly is.&#x201d;<br>I narrow my eyes, not sure I believe it. Never mind the fact that he&#x2019;s been studying this stuff for hundreds of years.<br>&#x201c;Seriously, Ever. Nothing is separate.&#x201d; He leans toward me, fully warmed up to his subject now. &#x201c;Everything is one. Items that appear dense, like you and I, and this sand that we&#x2019;re sitting on, are really just a mass of energy vibrating slowly enough to seem solid, while things like ghosts and spirits vibrate so quickly they&#x2019;re nearly impossible for most humans to see.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I see Riley,&#x201d; I say, eager to remind him of all the time I used to spend with my ghostly sister. &#x201c;Or at least I used to, you know, before she crossed the bridge and moved on.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And that&#x2019;s exactly why you can&#x2019;t see her anymore.&#x201d; He nods. &#x201c;Her vibration is moving too fast. Though there are those who can see past all of that.&#x201d;<br>I gaze at the ocean before us, the swells rolling in, one after another. Endless, unceasing, immortal&#x2014;like us.<br>&#x201c;Now raise your hand again and bring it so close to mine we just nearly touch.&#x201d;<br>I hesitate, filling my palm with sand, unwilling to do it. Unlike him, I know the price, the dire consequences the slightest skin-on-skin contact can bring. Which is why I&#x2019;ve been avoiding his touch since last Friday. But when I peer at him again, his palm out, waiting for mine, I take a deep breath and lift my hand too&#x2014;gasping when he draws so close the space that divides is razor thin.<br>&#x201c;Feel that?&#x201d; He smiles. &#x201c;That tingle and heat? That&#x2019;s our energy connecting.&#x201d; He moves his hand back and forth, manipulating the push and pull of the energy force field between us.<br>&#x201c;But if we&#x2019;re all connected like you say, then why doesn&#x2019;t it all feel the same?&#x201d; I whisper, drawn by the undeniable magnetic stream that links us, causing the most wonderful warmth to course through my body.<br>&#x201c;We are all connected, all of us made of the same vibrating source. But while some energy leaves you cold and some leaves you lukewarm, the one that you&#x2019;re destined for? It feels just like this.&#x201d;<br>I close my eyes and turn, allowing the tears to stream down my cheeks, no longer able to keep them in check. Knowing I&#x2019;m barred from the feel of his skin, the touch of his lips, the solid warm comfort of his body on mine. This electric energy field that trembles between us is the closest I&#x2019;ll get, thanks to the horrible decision I made.<br>&#x201c;Science is just now catching up with what metaphysicians and the great spiritual teachers have known for centuries. Everything is energy. Everything is one.&#x201d;<br>I can hear the smile in his voice as he draws closer, eager to entwine his fingers with mine. But I move away quickly, catching his eye just long enough to see the look of hurt that crosses his face&#x2014;the same look he&#x2019;s been giving me since I made him drink the antidote that returned him to life. Wondering why I&#x2019;m acting so quiet, so distant, so remote&#x2014;refusing to touch him when just a few weeks before I couldn&#x2019;t get enough. Incorrectly assuming it&#x2019;s because of his hurtful behavior&#x2014;his flirting with Stacia, his cruelty toward me&#x2014;when the truth is, it has nothing to do with that. He was under Roman&#x2019;s spell, the entire school was. It wasn&#x2019;t his fault.<br>What he doesn&#x2019;t know is that while the antidote returned him to life, the moment I added my blood to the mix it also ensured we could never be together.<br>Never.<br>Ever.<br>For all of eternity.<br>&#x201c;Ever?&#x201d; he whispers, voice deep and sincere. But I can&#x2019;t look at him. Can&#x2019;t touch him. And I certainly can&#x2019;t utter the words he deserves to hear:<br>I messed up&#x2014;I&#x2019;m so sorry&#x2014;Roman tricked me, and I was desperate and dumb enough to fall for his ploy&#x2014;And now there&#x2019;s no hope for us because if you kiss me, if we exchange our DNA&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll die&#x2014;<br>I can&#x2019;t do it. I&#x2019;m the worst kind of coward. I&#x2019;m pathetic and weak. And there&#x2019;s just no way I can find it within me.<br>&#x201c;Ever, please, what is it?&#x201d; he asks, alarmed by my tears. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been like this for days. Is it me? Is it something I&#x2019;ve done? Because you know I don&#x2019;t remember much of what happened, and the memories that are starting to surface, well, you must know by now that wasn&#x2019;t the real me. I would never intentionally hurt you. I&#x2019;d never harm you in any way.&#x201d;<br>I hug myself tightly, scrunching my shoulders and bowing my head. Wishing I could make myself smaller, so small he could no longer see me. Knowing his words are true, that he&#x2019;s incapable of hurting me, only I could do something so hurtful, so rash, so ridiculously impulsive. Only I could be stupid enough to fall for Roman&#x2019;s bait. So eager to prove myself as Damen&#x2019;s one true love&#x2014;wanting to be the only one who could save him&#x2014;and now look at the mess that I&#x2019;ve made.<br>He moves toward me, sliding his arm around me, grasping my waist and pulling me near. But I can&#x2019;t risk the closeness, my tears are lethal now, and must be kept far from his skin.<br>I scramble to my feet and run toward the ocean, curling my toes at its edge and allowing the cold white froth to splash onto my shins. Wishing I could dive under its vastness and be carried by the tide. Anything to avoid saying the words&#x2014;anything to avoid telling my one true love, my eternal partner, my soul mate for the last four hundred years, that while he may have given me eternity&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve brought us our end.<br>I remain like that, silent and still. Waiting for the sun to sink until I finally turn to face him. Taking in his dark shadowy outline, nearly indistinguishable from the night, and speaking past the sting in my throat when I mumble, &#x201c;Damen ... baby ... there&#x2019;s something I need to tell you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Excerpted from Shadowland by Alyson No�l.<br>Copyright � 2009 by Alyson No�l.<br>Published in September 2010 by St. Martin&#x2019;s Griffin.<br>All rights reserved.

Original.</p><p>With humor and powerful insight, David Icke exposes the mental and emotional prisons which billions of people build around themselves - prisons which allow a tiny few to control the direction of the world. He shows how shallow and ridiculous are the fears, guilts, resentments and limitations which blight the lives of humankind, and he offers the key to mental and emotional liberation. Icke also reveals staggering information about the almost unspeakable activities of world famous politicians and &#39;entertainers&#39;. This devastating expose of the human condition and those who manipulate the human mind is a getaway car for the psyche. It will make you laugh. It will make you think. It will blow your mind.

It is the story of an aristocratic family, a house, a mysterious death and a way of life that vanished forever, told in flashback by a woman who witnessed it all and kept a secret for decades.</b> <br> <br> Grace Bradley went to work at Riverton House as a servant when she was just a girl, before the First World War. For years her life was inextricably tied up with the Hartford family, most particularly the two daughters, Hannah and Emmeline. <br> <br> In the summer of 1924, at a glittering society party held at the house, a young poet shot himself. The only witnesses were Hannah and Emmeline and only they -- and Grace -- know the truth. <br> <br> In 1999, when Grace is ninety-eight years old and living out her last days in a nursing home, she is visited by a young director who is making a film about the events of that summer. She takes Grace back to Riverton House and reawakens her memories. Told in flashback, this is the story of Grace's youth during the last days of Edwardian aristocratic privilege shattered by war, of the vibrant twenties and the changes she witnessed as an entire way of life vanished forever. <br> <br> The novel is full of secrets -- some revealed, others hidden forever, reminiscent of the romantic suspense of Daphne du Maurier. It is also a meditation on memory, the devastation of war and a beautifully rendered window into a fascinating time in history. <br> <br> Originally published to critical acclaim in Australia, already sold in ten countries and a #1 bestseller in England, <i>The House at Riverton</i> is a vivid, page-turning novel of suspense and passion, with characters -- and an ending -- the reader won't soon forget.</p><p>Amazon Best of the Month, April 2008: In her cinematic debut novel, Kate Morton immerses readers in the dramas of the Ashbury family at their crumbling English country estate in the years surrounding World War I, an age when Edwardian civility, shaken by war, unravels into the roaring Twenties. Grace came to serve in the house as a girl. She left as a young woman, after the presumed suicide of a famous young poet at the property's lake. Though she has dutifully kept the family's secrets for decades, memories flood back in the twilight of her life when a young filmmaker comes calling with questions about how the poet really died--and why the Ashbury sisters never again spoke to each other afterward. With beautifully crafted prose, Morton methodically reveals how passion and fate transpired that night at the lake, with truly shocking results. Her final revelation at the story's close packs a satisfying (and not overly sentimental) emotional punch. <i>--Mari Malcolm</i>Kate Morton is the award-winning, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The House at Riverton</i>, <i>The Forgotten Garden</i>, <i>The Distant Hours</i>, <i>The Secret Keeper</i>, <i>The Lake House</i>, and<i> The Clockmaker&#x2019;s Daughter</i>.

The ancient regime running the parish covertly demands that she prove herself as a leader. However, her blunt manner, honed by years as an army pilot, is meeting with a chilly reception from some members of her congregation and Chief of Police Russ Van Alystyne, in particular, doesn't know what to make of her, or how to address "a lady priest" for that matter. <br><br>The last thing she needs is trouble, but that is exactly what she finds. When a newborn baby is abandoned on the church stairs and a young mother is brutally murdered, Clare has to pick her way through the secrets and silence that shadow that town like the ever-present Adirondack mountains. As the days dwindle down and the attraction between the avowed priest and the married police chief grows, Clare will need all her faith, tenacity, and courage to stand fast against a killer's icy heart. <br><br><i>In the Bleak Midwinter</i> is one of the most outstanding Malice Domestic winners the contest has seen. The compelling atmosphere-the kind of very cold and snowy winter that is typical of upstate New York-will make you reach for another sweater. The characters are fully and believably drawn and you will feel like they are your old friends and find yourself rooting for them every step of the way.</p><p>Heavy Snow...Icy Desires...Cold-Blooded Murder <br>Clare Fergusson, St. Alban's new priest, fits like a square peg in the conservative Episcopal parish at Miller's Kill, New York. She is not just a "lady," she's a tough ex Army chopper pilot, and nobody's fool.

"Each of these pictures must stand on its own," Susan Sontag writes in the essay that accompanies the portraits. "But the ensemble says, So this what women are now -- as different, as varied, as heroic, as forlorn, as conventional, as unconventional as this."</p><p>Each of the extraordinary portraits made by photographer Annie Leibovitz for her book <i>Women</i> stands on its own. Looked at together, these "photographs of people with nothing more in common than that they are women (and living in America at the end of the twentieth century), all--well almost all--fully clothed," writes Susan Sontag in the book's preface, form "an anthology of destinies and disabilities and new possibilities." Leibovitz, who in her years working for <i>Rolling Stone</i>, <i>Vogue</i>, and <i>Vanity Fair</i> magazines has photographed hundreds of celebrities, turns her lens on a wide range of ordinary and extraordinary female subjects: coal miners, socialites, first ladies, artists, domestic-violence victims, an astronaut, a surgeon, a maid. What she creates is a reflection of contemporary American womanhood that mirrors both women's accomplishments and the challenges they still face individually and as a group.<p> Leibovitz demonstrates her own range as a photographer in this body of work, shooting in the studio and natural settings and working in both black-and-white and color film. She depicts model Jerry Hall wearing a little black dress, a fur coat, and high heels, staring frankly at the viewer from a velvet chair in a plush red parlor while her naked infant son nurses from her exposed right breast. Schoolteacher Lamis Srour's eyes--the only part of her face visible behind her heavy black veil--illuminate a dark black-and-white portrait. Leibovitz frames actress Elizabeth Taylor and her dog Sugar by their shocks of snow-white hair. She captures four Kilgore College Rangerettes, a drill team, at the apex of their kicks--white-booted legs pointing up, obscuring their faces and revealing the red underpants beneath their blue miniskirts. There are many more wonderful and unexpected images here, over 200 in all. The delight in discovering them awaits readers. <i>--Jordana Moskowitz</i></p>Undertake to do a book of photographs of people with nothing more in common than that they are women (and living in America at the end of the twentieth century), all-well, almost all-fully clothed, therefore not the other kind of all-women picture book ... <br><br>Start with no more than a commanding notion of the sheer interestingness of the subject, especially in view of the unprecedented changes in the consciousness of many women in these last decades, and a resolve to stay open to whim and opportunity ... <br><br>Sample, explore, revisit, choose, arrange, without claiming to have brought to the page a representative miscellany ...<br><br>Even so, a large number of pictures of what is, nominally, a single subject will inevitably be felt to be representative in some sense. How much more so with this subject, with this book, an anthology of destinies and disabilities and new possibilities; a book that invites the sympathetic responses we bring to the depiction of a minority (for that is what women are, by every criterion except the numerical), featuring many portraits of those who are a credit to their sex. Such a book has to feel instructive, even if it tells us what we think we already know about the overcoming of perennial impediments and prejudices and cultural handicaps, the conquest of new zones of achievement. Of course, such a book would be misleading if it did not touch on the bad news as well: the continuing authority of demeaning stereotypes, the continuing violence (domestic assault is the leading cause of injuries to American women). Any large-scale picturing of women belongs to the ongoing story of how women are presented, and how they are invited to think of themselves. A book of photographs of women must, whether it intends to or not, raise the question of women-there <br>is no equivalent "question of men." Men, unlike women, are not a work in progress. <br><br>Each of these pictures must stand on its own. But the ensemble says, So this is what women are now-as different, as varied, as heroic, as forlorn, as conventional, as unconventional as this. Nobody scrutinizing the book will fall to note the confirmation of stereotypes of what women are like and the challenge to those stereotypes. Whether well-known or obscure, each of the nearly one hundred and seventy women in this album will be looked at (especially by other women) as models: models of beauty, models of self-esteem, models of strength, models of transgressiveness, models of victimhood, models of false consciousness, models of successful aging. <br><br>No book of photographs of men would be interrogated in the same way. <br><br>But then a book of photographs of men would not be undertaken in the same spirit. How could there be any interest in asserting that a man can be a stockbroker or a farmer or an astronaut or a miner? A book of photographs of men with sundry occupations, men only (without any additional label), would probably be a book about the beauty of men, men as objects of lustful imaginings to women and to other men. <br><br>But when men are viewed as sex objects, that is not their primary identity. The traditions of regarding men as, at least potentially, the creators and curators of their own destinies and women as objects of male emotions and fantasies (lust, tenderness, fear, condescension, scorn, dependence), of regarding an individual man as an instance of humankind and an individual woman as an instance of . . . women, are still largely intact, deeply rooted in language narrative, group arrangements, and family customs. In no language does the pronoun "she" stand for human beings of both sexes. Women and men are differently weighted, physically and culturally, with different contours of selfhood, all presumptively favoring those born male. <br><br>I do this, I endure this, I want this ... because I am a woman. I do that, I endure that, I want that ... even though I'm a woman. Because of the man dated inferiority of women, their condition as a cultural minority, there continues to be a debate about what women are, can be, should want to be. Freud is famously supposed to have asked, "Lord, what do women want?" Imagine a world in which it seems normal to inquire, "Lord, what do men want?"...but who can imagine such a world?<br><br>No one thinks the Great Duality is symmetrical-even in America, noted since the nineteenth century by foreign travelers as a paradise for uppity women. Feminine and masculine are a tilted polarity. Equal rights for men has never inspired a march or a hunger strike. In no country are men legal minors, as women were until well into the twentieth century in many European countries, and are still in many Muslim countries, from Morocco to Afghanistan. No country gave women the right to vote before giving it to men. Nobody ever thought of men as the second sex. <br><br>And yet, and yet: there is something new in the world, starting with the revoking of age-old legal shackles regarding suffrage, divorce, property rights. It seems almost inconceivable now that the enfranchisement of women happened as recently as it did: that, for instance, women in France and Italy had to wait until 1945 and 1946 to be able to vote. There have been tremendous changes in women's consciousness, transforming the inner life of everyone: the sallying forth of women from women's worlds into the world at large, the arrival of women's ambitions. Ambition is what women have been schooled to stifle in themselves, and what is celebrated in a book of photographs that emphasizes the variety of women's lives today. <br><br>Such a book, however much it attends to women's activeness, is also about women's attractiveness. <br><br>Nobody looks through a book of pictures of women without noticing whether the women are attractive or not. <br><br>To be feminine, in one commonly felt definition, is to be attractive, or to do one's best to be attractive; to attract. (As being masculine is being strong.) While it is perfectly possible to defy this imperative, it is not possible for any woman to be unaware of it. As it is thought a weakness in a man to care a great deal about how he looks, it is a moral fault in a woman not to care "enough."<br><br>Women are judged by their appearance as men are not, and women are punished more than men are by the changes brought about by aging. Ideals of appearance such as, youthfulness and slimness are in large part now created and enforced by photographic images. And, of course, a primary interest in having photographs of well-known beauties to look at over the years is seeing just how well or badly they negotiate the shame of aging. <br><br>In advanced consumer societies, it is said, these "narcissistic" values are more and more the concern of men as well. But male primping never loosens the male lock on initiative taking. Indeed, glorying in one's appearance is an ancient warrior's pleasure, an expression of power, an instrument of dominance. Anxiety about personal attractiveness could never be thought defining of a man: a man can always be seen. Women are looked at. <br><br>We assume a world with a boundless appetite for images, in which people, women and men, are eager to surrender themselves to the camera. But it is worth recalling that there are parts of the world where being photographed is something off-limits to women. In a few countries, where men have been mobilized for a veritable war against women, women scarcely appear at all. The imperial rights of the camera-to gaze at, to record, to exhibit anyone, anything-are an exemplary feature of modern life, as is the emancipation of women. And just as the granting of more and more rights and choices to women s a measure o a societys embrace of modernity, so the revolt against modernity initiates a rush to rescind the meager gains toward participation in society on equal terms with men won by women, mostly urban, educated women, in previous decades. In many countries struggling with failed or discredited attempts to modernize, there are more and more covered women. <br><br>The traditional unity of a book of photographs of women is some ideal of female essence: women gaily displaying their sexual charms, women veiling themselves behind a look of soulfulness or primness. <br><br>Portraits of women featured their beauty; portraits of men their "character." Beauty (the province of women) was smooth; character (the province of men) was rugged. Feminine was yielding, placid, or plaintive; masculine was forceful, piercing. Men didn't look wistful. Women, ideally, didn't look forceful.<br>When in the early 1860s a well-connected, exuberant, middle-aged Englishwoman named Julia Margaret Cameron took up the camera as a vocation, she usually photographed men differently than she photographed women. The men, who included some of the most eminent poets, sages, and scientists of the Victorian era, were posed for their portraits. The women-somebody's wife, daughter, sister, niece-served mostly as models for "fancy sub)ects" (Cameron's label). Women were used to personify ideals of womanliness drawn from literature or mythology: the vulnerability and pathos of Ophelia; the tenderness of the Madonna with her Child. Almost all the sitters were relatives and friends reclothed, incarnated several exalted or her parlormaid, who, suitably icons of femininity. Only Julia Jackson, Cameron's niece (and the future mother of the future Virginia Woolf), was, in homage to her exceptional beauty, never posed as anyone but herself. <br><br>What qualified the women as sitters was precisely their beauty, as fame and achievement qualified the men. The beauty of women made them ideal subjects. (Notably, there was no role for picturesque or exotic beauty, so that when Cameron and her husband moved to Ceylon, she virtually stopped taking pictures.) Indeed, Cameron defined photography as a quest for the beautiful. And quest it was: "Why does not Mrs. Smith come to be photographed?" she wrote to a friend about a lady in London whom she had never met. "I hear she is Beautiful. Bid her come, and she shall be made Immortal." <br><br>Imagine a book of pictures of women in which none of the women could be identified as beautiful. Wouldn't we feel that the photographer had made some kind of mistake? Was being mean-spirited? Misogynistic? Was depriving us of something that we had a right to see? No one would say the same thing of a book of portraits of men. <br><br>There were always several kinds of beauty: imperious beauty, voluptuous beauty, beauty signifying the character traits that fitted a woman for the confines of genteel domes ticity-do cill ty, pliancy, serenity. Beauty was not just loveliness of feature and expression, an aesthetic ideal. It also spoke to the eye about the virtues deemed essential in women. <br><br>For a woman to be intelligent was not essential, not even particularly appropriate. It was in fact considered disabling, and likely to be inscribed in her appearance. Such is the fate of a principal character in The Woman in White, Wilkie Collins's robustly, enthrallingly clever bestseller, which appeared in 1860, just before Cameron started making her portraits. Here is how this woman is introduced, early in the novel, in the voice of its young hero: <br><br>... I looked from the table to the window farthest from me, and saw a lady standing at it, with her back turned towards me. The instant my eyes rested on her, I was struck by the rare beauty of her form, and by the unaffected grace of her attitude. Her figure was tall, yet not too tall; comely and well-developed, yet not fat; her head set on her shoulders with an easy, pliant firmness; her waist, perfection in the eyes of a man, for it occupied its natural place, it filled out its natural circle, it was visibly and delightfully undeformed by stays. She had not heard my entrance into the room; and I allowed myself the luxury of admiring her for a few moments, before I moved one of the chairs near me, as the least embarrassing means of attracting her attention. She turned towards me immediately. The easy elegance of every movement of her limbs and body as soon as she began to advance from the far end of the room set me in a flutter of expectation to see her face clearly. She left the window-and I said to myself, The lady is dark. She moved forward a few steps-and I said to myself, The lady is young. She approached nearer-and I said to myself (with a sense of surprise which words fail me to express), The lady is ugly! <br><br>Reveling in the presumptions and delights of the appraising male gaze, the narrator has noted that, seen from behind and in long shot, the lady satisfies all the criteria of female desirability. Hence his acute surprise, when she turns and comes toward him, at her "ugly" face (it is not allowed to be just plain or homely), which, he explains, is a kind of paradox: <br><br>Never was the old conventional maxim, that Nature cannot err, more flatly contradicted-never was the fair promise of a lovely figure more strangely and startlingly belied by the face and head that crowned it. The lady's complexion was almost swarthy, and the dark down on her upper lip was almost a moustache. She had a large, firm, masculine mouth and jaw; prominent, piercing, resolute brown eyes; and thick, coal-black hair, growing unusually low down on her forehead. Her expression-b right, frank, and intelligent-appeared, while she was silent, to be altogether wanting in those feminine attractions of gentleness and pliability, without which the beauty of the handsomest woman alive is beauty incomplete. <br><br>Marian Halcombe will turn out to be the most admirable character in Collins's novel, awarded every virtue except the capacity to inspire desire. Moved only by generous, noble sentiments, she has a near angelic, that is, archetypally femmine, temperament-except for the troubling matter of her uncommon intelligence, her frankness, her want of "pliability." Marian Halcombe's body, so ideally feminine that it is judged ripe for appropriation by a (presumably male) artist, conveys "modest graces of action." Her head, her face, signifies something more concentrated, exacting-unfeminine. The body gives one message, the face another. And face trumps body-as intelligence, to the detriment of female sexual attractiveness, trumps beauty. The narrator concludes: <br><br>To see such a face as this set on shoulders that a sculptor would have longed to model-to be charmed by the modest graces of action through which the symmetrical limbs betrayed their beauty when they moved, and then to be almost repelled by the masculine form and masculine look of the features in which the perfectly shaped figure ended-was to feel a sensation oddly akin to the helpless discomfort familiar to us all in sleep, when we recognise yet cannot reconcile the anomalies and contradictions of a dream. <br><br>Collins's male narrator is touching a gender faultline, which typically arouses anxieties and feelings of discomfort. The contradiction in the order of sexual stereotypes may seem dreamlike to a well-adjusted inhabitant of an era in which action, enterprise, artistic creativity, and intellectual innovation are understood to be masculine, fraternal orders. For a long time the beauty of a woman seemed incompatible, or at least oddly matched, with intelligence and assertiveness. (A far greater novelist, Henry James, in the preface to The Portrait of a Lady, speaks of the challenge of filling the "frail vessel" of a female protagonist with all the richness of an independent consciousness.) To be sure, no novelist today would find it implausible to award good looks to a woman who is cerebral and self-assertive. But in real life it's still common to begrudge a woman who has both beauty and intellectual brilliance-one would never say there was something odd or intimidating or "unfair" about a man who was so fortunate-as if beauty, the ultimate en...</p><h2>Classical Literary Criticism</h2><p>This anthology brings together core classical texts for understanding literature. The selections from Plato illustrate the poetic philosopher's surprising exclusion of poets from his ideal republic. In his response, <b>Poetics</b>, Aristotle draws on the works of the great Greek playwrights to defend the value of the art. Horace's <b>The Art of Poetry</b> is a vivid practitioner's guide that promotes a style of poetic craftsmanship rooted in wisdom, ethical insight, and decorum. Longinus's <b>On the Sublime</b> explores the nature of inspiration in poetry and prose. This volume is a work of great value and interest to classicists, students, and writers.<br><br>In her Introduction, Penelope Murray compares and contrasts the viewpoints of these formidable critics as well as their impact on the Western tradition. This edition also includes a new bibliography and chronology and comprehensive notes to each of the texts.</p><p>This new edition of Classical Literary Criticism contains the landmarks of ancient literary criticism in accessible and lucid translations.<p>In her Introduction Penelope Murray shows how many of the most fruitful approaches to understanding literature in the Western tradition derive from these canonical texts. Plato is often regarded as the most poetic of the great philosophers, but he mistrusted the god-like power of poets to work on our feelings and famously banished them from his ideal Republic. Aristotle responded by defending the value of art in his Poetics. His analysis of tragedy, with its key concepts of mimesis, catharsis and hamartia, has influenced generations of critics from the Renaissance onwards. Horace's The Art of Poetry is a vivid practitioner's guide that promotes a style of poetic craftsmanship rooted in wisdom, ethical insight and decorum, while Longinus' remarkable On the Sublime explores the nature of inspiration in poetry and prose.</p><p>This edition also features a new bibliography and chronology as well as comprehensive notes to each of the texts.</p><p><b>Aristotle</b> was born at Stageira, in the dominion of the kings of Macedonia, in 384 BC. For twenty years he studied at Athens in the Academy of Plato, on whose death in 347 he left, and, some time later, became tutor of the young Alexander the Great. When Alexander succeeded to the throne of Macedonia in 335, Aristotle returned to Athens and established his school and research institute, the Lyceum, to which his great erudition attracted a large number of scholars. After Alexander's death in 323, anti-Macedonian feeling drove Aristotle out of Athens, and he fled to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322. His writings, which were of extraordinary range, profoundly affected the whole course of ancient and medieval philosophy, and they are still eagerly studied and debated by philosophers today. Very many of them have survived and among the most famous are the <b>Ethics</b> and the <b>Politics</b>.</p><br><b>Quintus Horatius Flaccus</b> was born in 6 B.C. at Venusia in Apulia. His father, though once a slave, had made enough money as an auctioneer to send his son to a well-known school in Rome and subsequently to university in Athens. There Horace joined Brutus&#x2019; army and served on his staff until the defeat at Philippi in 42 BC. On returning to Rome, he found that his father was dead and his property had been confiscated, but he succeeded in obtaining a secretarial post in the treasury, which gave him enough to live on. The poetry he wrote in the next few years impressed Virgil, who introduced him to the great patron Maecenas in 38 BC. This event marked the beginning of a life-long friendship. From now on Horace had no financial worries; he moved freely among the leading poets and statesmen of Rome; his work was admired by Augustus, and indeed after Virgil&#x2019;s death in 19 BC he was virtually Poet Laureate. Horace died in 8 BC, only a few months after Maecenas.</p><h2>Unhinged: The Trouble with Psychiatry - A Doctor&#39;s Revelations about a Profession in Crisis</h2><p><b>IN THIS STIRRING AND BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN WAKE-UP CALL, </b>psychiatrist Daniel Carlat exposes deeply disturbing problems plaguing his profession, revealing the ways it has abandoned its essential purpose: to understand the mind, so that psychiatrists can heal mental illness and not just treat symptoms. As he did in his hard-hitting and widely read <i>New York Times Magazine </i>article "Dr. Drug Rep," and as he continues to do in his popular watchdog newsletter, <i>The Carlat Psychiatry Report</i>, he writes with bracing honesty about how psychiatry has so largely forsaken the practice of talk therapy for the seductive&#x2014;and more lucrative&#x2014;practice of simply prescribing drugs, with a host of deeply troubling consequences. <br><br>Psychiatrists have settled for treating symptoms rather than causes, embracing the apparent medical rigor of DSM diagnoses and prescription in place of learning the more challenging craft of therapeutic counseling, gaining only limited understanding of their patients&#x2019; lives. Talk therapy takes time, whereas the fifteen-minute "med check" allows for more patients and more insurance company reimbursement. Yet DSM diagnoses, he shows, are premised on a good deal less science than we would think. <br><br>Writing from an insider&#x2019;s perspective, with refreshing forthrightness about his own daily struggles as a practitioner, Dr. Carlat shares a wealth of stories from his own practice and those of others that demonstrate the glaring shortcomings of the standard fifteen-minute patient visit. He also reveals the dangers of rampant diagnoses of bipolar disorder, ADHD, and other "popular" psychiatric disorders, and exposes the risks of the cocktails of medications so many patients are put on. Especially disturbing are the terrible consequences of overprescription of drugs to children of ever younger ages. Taking us on a tour of the world of pharmaceutical marketing, he also reveals the inner workings of collusion between psychiatrists and drug companies. <br><br>Concluding with a road map for exactly how the profession should be reformed, <i>Unhinged </i>is vital reading for all those in treatment or considering it, as well as a stirring call to action for the large community of psychiatrists themselves. As physicians and drug companies continue to work together in disquieting and harmful ways, and as diagnoses&#x2014;and misdiagnoses&#x2014;of mental disorders skyrocket, it&#x2019;s essential that Dr. Carlat&#x2019;s bold call for reform is heeded.</p><p>Daniel Carlat, M.D., is on the faculty of Tufts Medical School and did his psychiatric training at Harvard Medical School and Masschusetts General Hospital, where he was chief resident of the inpatient psychiatric unit.

To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the classic book that changed an industry, McGraw-Hill has reunited mavens of marketing Al Ries and Jack Trout to make available to another generation of advertisers the book that forever changed the way advertising is done.</p> <p>The 20th Anniversary Edition features commentary from the authors that offers fresh insight into why "positioning" a product in a prospective customer's mind is still the most important strategy in business. Ries and Trout look back over two decades of campaigns, offering penetrating analyses of some of the most phenomenal successes and unbelievable failures in advertising history.</p> <p>The first book to deal with the problems of communicating to a skeptical, over-communicated public, <i>Positioning </i>describes a revolutionary approach to creating a "position" in a prospective customer's mind that reflects a company's own strengths and weaknesses as well as those of its competitors. Writing in their trademark witty, fast-paced style, Ries and Trout explain how to position an industry leader so that it gets into people's minds and stays there, how to position a follower so that it can occupy a space not claimed by the leader, and how to avoid letting a second product ride on the coattails of an established one.</p>Al Ries is Chairman of Ries &amp; Ries, Rowsell, GA (www.ries.com).

At that point, a great divide occurred in the rates that human societies evolved. In Eurasia, parts of the Americas, and Africa, farming became the prevailing mode of existence when indigenous wild plants and animals were domesticated by prehistoric planters and herders. As Jared Diamond vividly reveals, the very people who gained a head start in producing food would collide with preliterate cultures, shaping the modern world through conquest, displacement, and genocide. </p><p> The paths that lead from scattered centers of food to broad bands of settlement had a great deal to do with climate and geography. But how did differences in societies arise? Why weren't native Australians, Americans, or Africans the ones to colonize Europe? Diamond dismantles pernicious racial theories tracing societal differences to biological differences. </p><p> He assembles convincing evidence linking germs to domestication of animals, germs that Eurasians then spread in epidemic proportions in their voyages of discovery. In its sweep, Guns, Germs and Steel encompasses the rise of agriculture, technology, writing, government, and religion, providing a unifying theory of human history as intriguing as the histories of dinosaurs and glaciers. </p><p> Jared Diamond, professor of physiology at the UCLA Medical School, is the author of <b>The Third Chimpanzee</b>, awarded the 1992 <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Science Book Award. He is a regular contributor to <b>Natural History</b> and <b>Discover</b> magazines and lives in Los Angeles.</p></p><p>Explaining what William McNeill called <i>The Rise of the West</i> has become the central problem in the study of global history. In <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i> Jared Diamond presents the biologist's answer: geography, demography, and ecological happenstance. Diamond evenhandedly reviews human history on every continent since the Ice Age at a rate that emphasizes only the broadest movements of peoples and ideas. Yet his survey is binocular: one eye has the rather distant vision of the evolutionary biologist, while the other eye--and his heart--belongs to the people of New Guinea, where he has done field work for more than 30 years.11 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Building with Structural Insulated Panels: Strength &amp; Energy Efficiency Through Structural Panel Construction</h2><p>Within the decade, it is estimated that as much as one-third of residential construction will use structural insulated panels, or SIPs.

Its author spent 40 years combing historical records and interviewing dozens of descendants of pioneer settlers and Native Americans who shared oral traditions that have been passed down through generations. <p>What emerges is history as it has never been told before. A history of conquistadors and fur trappers, of merchants and missionaries. The history of an Indian war that was one of the longest and bloodiest conflicts ever fought on American soil, but which for political and economic reasons was covered up for decades. Above all, the history of &#x201c;those first settlers of the Ochoco&#x2014;men, woman, and children&#x2014;who were left to wander and starve in a land they thought belonged to them through eternity, a people who in their final agony cried out: `Nimma ne-umpu!'&#x2014;`We too are human!&#x2019; </p><p>Gale Ontko tells this story with compassion and grace, in a style that combines the precision of the scholar with the vigor and drama of the novelist. The five volumes comprise nearly 2500 printed book pages and have been described by some as the most factual writing by any author on the history of the Shoshoni People. </p><p>Volume II covert the twenty-year period between 1840 and 1860 would see overland migration across the land known to the Shoshoni as the Ochoco&#x2014;Land of the Red Willow. The Americans would call it eastern Oregon. Never on friendly terms with the white invaders, the Shoshoni tolerated passage across their ancestral hunting grounds only so long as the American homesteaders stayed strictly on the dusty thoroughfare called the Oregon Trail. When they transgressed, the distant thunder of gunfire reverberated across interior Oregon like the tolling of a death knell. Volume II narrates the suffering, heartache and death of those unfortunate souls who dared to venture into the Ochoco; and it covers the first brutal Indian wars fought west of the Mississippi River.</p></p><p>Mix together equal portions of the intellectual curiosity and organizational abilities of Benjamin Franklin and the steely determination of Ulysses S. Grant, let simmer in the Ochocos of Central Oregon for nearly seven decades and the product is Gale Ontko, the writer of Thunder Over the Ochoco. <p> In most respects this is a man who became an author because of circumstances rather than desire. He grew up in the Ochoco Valley area east of Prineville and unlike most Oregonians has spent his life on the land. His employment as a BLM fire management supervisor took him into back country for long stretches of time and the Indians of the area got to know him so well they finally gave him an Indian name of his own. </p><p> It all began innocently enough when he realized that native Americans&#x2014;except for brief reports of an encounter on the Little Big Horn&#x2014;had been ignored in the writing of American history as totally as our other non-European minorities. He began to talk with Indians, take notes and enter the world of historical research until one day he felt he was able to add something to what had been written about early days in the Northwest. His other motivation was an increasing belief that the rather desolate land mass of the Ochoco had itself profoundly influenced the history of the region and had an interesting story of its own to be told, if someone was willing to do the work of putting it in proper order. </p><p> To a greater extent than is usually the case his writing is a mirror reflection of the man himself. It is said that only the very rich and/or those who live alone can afford the luxury of very strong attitudes and convictions. Gale has lived by himself for many years and the two special gifts of that experience which he brings to his writing are an iron-willed determination to be sure that he has the facts right and an incredible degree of patience. The first has led him to an extraordinary depth of research. There was no solid backlog of Indian data, because the Shoshoni had no written language. So he listened carefully to the oral histories of all the principal tribes and then sought verification by crosschecking contemporary written materials. He has known that his writing breaks new ground and has been determined that regardless of the amount of research required that it stand solid against all inquiry. His remarkable patience has let him continue for years the assembling of his facts before doing the writing. </p><p> His book has the refreshing directness and, when necessary, the bluntness that back country people still retain and which their urban cousins have largely abandoned. He has made every effort possible to learn the truth about the people who made the history about which he writes and then to state it. Hudson&#x2019;s Bay Company is not likely to send him a thank-you note, genteel readers may feel they could get along with fewer details of the way the trapper brigades lived and any descendants of Protestant missionaries to Oregon might well consider putting out a contract on this man. The good news is that when most readers finish this book they are very likely to say, &#x201c;I had no idea non-fiction could be so interesting.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>The Best Bread Machine Cookbook Ever</h2><p>A loaf of bread, a bread machine, and you.<p></p><p>Whether you have just purchased a new bread machine or have been using onefor some time, you're in for a treat.

After decades of patient work, Hopper enjoyed a success and popularity that since the 1950s has continually grown.<br> <br> In canvas after canvas he painted the loneliness of big-city people. Many of Hopper&#x2019;s pictures represent views of streets and roads, rooftops, and abandoned houses, depicted in a brilliant light that strangely belies the melancholy mood of the scenes.<br> <br> Hopper&#x2019;s paintings are marked by striking juxtapositions of color, and by the clear contours with which the figures are demarcated from their surroundings. His extremely precise focus on the theme of modern men and women in the natural and man-made environment sometimes lends his pictures a mood of eerie disquiet. On the other hand, Hopper&#x2019;s renderings of rocky landscapes in warm brown hues, or his depictions of the seacoast, exude an unusual tranquillity that reveals another, more optimistic side of his character. &nbsp; <strong>About the Series:</strong><br> Each book in TASCHEN&#x2019;s Basic Art series features: <ul> <li> a detailed chronological summary of the life and oeuvre of the artist, covering his or her cultural and historical importance </li> <li> a concise biography </li> <li> approximately 100 illustrations with explanatory captions </li> </ul></p><p>Rolf G.

And who&#x2019;s killing those black men? The answer is most often <i>other</i> black men. Leovy, a writer for the Los Angeles <i>Times</i>, explores the culture of black violence, specifically in South Central LA, describing a world that seems to exist hermetically sealed off from the rest of the city. With nearly zero mobility and little policing, the people of South Central are left to fend for themselves&#x2014;further amplifying the devastating drumbeat of gangs and violence. Leovy builds her book around one family&#x2019;s story: Wally Tennelle, an LA cop, has refused to move his wife and kids out of his Watts neighborhood. Then his youngest son is murdered (unlike most murders in the area, this one was covered by the local media). Through the gathering of evidence, the roundup of suspects, and the trial that ultimately comes to be&#x2014;all spearheaded by John Skaggs, a very dedicated and capable LA homicide detective&#x2014;Leovy makes the argument that what places like South Central need is more policing, not less. They need more attention&#x2014;not debate, finger pointing, and inaction. &#x2013; <i>Chris Schluep</i></p><b>Jill Leovy</b> is an award-winning reporter for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>.

One of these, BILL PEET: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY, was named a 1989 Caldecott Honor Book. All of Bill Peet&#x2019;s books published by Houghton Mifflin Company, including his first book for children published in 1959, HUBERT'S HAIR-RAISING ADVENTURE, remain actively in print today. <br><br>In both his career as an author and illustrator of children&#x2019;s books and in his work as sketch artist and continuity illustrator at Walt Disney, Bill Peet created a menagerie of memorable characters. As he himself noted, "I write about animals because I love to draw them. Most of my animal characters have human personalities, and some are much like the people I know."<br><br>At Walt Disney, where Bill Peet worked for 27 years, he was a key participant in the production of classic films such as Fantasia, Sleeping Beauty, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, and 101 Dalmatians for which he was not only an artist, but the screenwriter as well. <br><br>Bill Peet&#x2019;s signature style enabled him to create fast-paced stories of fantastical adventure delivered with warmth and laugh-out-loud hilarity. His unfailing humor did not, however, prevent him from addressing such poignant issues as kindness toward others and respect for the environment. Through the exploits of his characters, Peet offered his audience a chance to see themselves and their world through new eyes.<br><br>"At some point," Bill Peet once said, "it occurred to me that drawing was something I couldn&#x2019;t possibly give up, and somehow it must be turned into a profession." He went on to not only fulfill his dream but to introduce generations of young readers to his delightful vision of humor, friendship and compassion.<br>Poor Pamela is insulted and abused by everyone at the circus, because they thinks she's dumb, so she runs away, following a train track. That's how she sees a broken train rail, stands on the track to stop an oncoming train, and saves the day. "Peet's funny, moving story demonstrates his genius for creating a picture book with more pith than the average," PW said. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Illustrated Gospels</h2><p><b>The Illustrated Gospels</b> combines the finest elements of modern book design with the beauty of the great illuminated manuscripts of the past. <b>48 five-color illustrations.</b></p><p></p><h2>Creeds, Councils, and Controversies</h2><p>history of the church</p><p></p><h2>The Complete Idiot&#39;s Guide to Music Theory, 2nd Edition</h2><p><b><i>A music theory book that hits the high note ...</i></b> <p> This updated and expanded edition of <i>The Complete Idiot&#x2019;s Guide� to Music Theory</i> breaks down a difficult subject in a simple way&#x2014;even for those who think they have no rhythm or consider themselves tone deaf.

How exactly does the animal world deal with the flip side of the life cycle? And what are the lessons, ecological to spiritual, raised by a close look at how the animal world renews itself?

Since beginning his career, Roger Shattuck has been mesmerized by one writer. First came <i>Proust's Binoculars</i>, a short, brilliant study published in 1964. Then came <i>Marcel Proust</i>, commissioned by Frank Kermode for the Modern Masters series, which won the National Book Award in 1974. A series of essays, lectures, and reviews followed. Now, like Richard Ellmann, whose constant outpourings on Joyce resulted in his triumphant biography James Joyce, Roger Shattuck written a new and definitive work. Devoting special care to Proust's masterpiece <i>In Search of Lost Time</i> (traditionally translated as <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>), Shattuck laments his subject's defenselessness against zealous editors, praises some translations, examines Proust's place in the path of aesthetic decadence blazed by Baudelaire and Wilde, and presents Proust as a novelist whose philosophical gifts were matched by his irrepressible comic sense. <i>Proust's Way</i>, the culmination of a lifetime of scholarship, will serve as the next generation's guide to Proust.</p><p>Roger Shattuck, author of Forbidden Knowledge and Proust&#39;s Way, has won the National Book Award. He lives in Vermont.Cobbling together commentary, instruction and practical advice, this grab-bag of a guide attempts to fill a gap in the vast library of Proust literature, with mixed results. Eminent scholar Shattuck (author of Proust's Binoculars and the National Book Award-winning Marcel Proust) eschews the personal approach favored by Alain de Botton and Phyllis Rose in their popular memoir-appreciations, but he does not limit himself to scholarly analysis, either, producing instead a kind of sophisticated Cliff Notes. The guide begins with a helpful overview of the novel and a chapter answering basic questions: in what language should one read Proust? (In French, if at all possible.) Is it absolutely necessary to read all 3,000 pages? (It is not--and Shattuck supplies an abridged reading plan in a footnote.) Moving on to a discussion of narrative strategies and themes, Shattuck urges an appreciation of Proust's often-overlooked comic sensibility and examines the author's more familiar preoccupations like time, memory and art. Most enlightening is his complex explication of the double "I" Proust employs: the gap between young Marcel and his older incarnation, the Narrator, creates what Shattuck terms a "stereopticon effect," by means of which the novel springs to four-dimensional life. A fascinating if polemical second-to-last chapter weighs in on ongoing debates in the world of Proust scholarship, judges the various French and English editions of the novel and examines its film versions. Although much of the guide is genuinely illuminating, the best material will be familiar to readers of Shattuck's previous works (he acknowledges his borrowings in his introduction), and some of the new sections--particularly an experimental "Coda," a fictional radio interview with a Proust scholar--strain for effect.

Mieth was the second woman staff photographer employed by Life magazine. Palfi&#39;s photo of Henry Street Settlement kids was the first cover of Ebony magazine. German born �migr�s who never met, they constructed remarkably similar photo narratives of unseen America. They were visual storytellers, artists, and citizen-photographers who do not fit easily into contemporary categories of photojournalism or documentary photography. Great risk-takers, they grasped the complexities inherent in representing human beings as individuals, as part of an ethnic, racial or labor group, and as citizens colonized in their own land. They may have photographed the circumstances of alienation, but their themes involved connection, human relationships, and solidarity. Unfinished Stories offers a fresh and theoretically informed eye on representational photography.

At the center of a triangle of Anglo-Saxons, Vikings, and Normans all jostling for control of England, Emma was a political pawn who became a power broker and an unscrupulous manipulator. By birth a Norman, Emma spent the majority of her life on English soil. She was married to two kings of England and outlived both; she was twice driven into exile; while mourning the untimely loss of one son, she was devastated by the murder of another; she saw two of her sons crowned; she was stripped of her powers when her eldest son became king; and she eventually retired from public life as a dowager queen whose land and wealth had been restored. Regarded by her contemporaries as a generous Christian patron, a regent admired by her subjects, and a Machiavellian mother, Emma was, above all, a survivor: hers was a life marked by dramatic reversals of fortune.</p></p><p>Harriet O&#39;Brien is a journalist based in London. She has written for the Independent and Cond� Nast Traveler, among other publications. This is her second book.While much remains unknown about Queen Emma as an individual, her story offers a fascinating entrance into the tumultuous world of late Anglo-Saxon England. Daughter of the duke of Normandy, descended just a few generations from Viking invaders, Emma (985&#x2013;1062) was the wife of two kings (the English Aethelred and, later, his Danish Viking successor, Cnut), the mother of two kings and great-aunt of the Norman William the Conqueror. Despite her secondary status as a woman, Emma can be seen as a key factor in this momentous transitional period, serving as a source of stability and continuity in uncertain times. London-based journalist O'Brien provides a lively account of the harsh realities of war and politics in this era, the vagaries of political marriage and the thin line between invaders and settlers. She examines without condescension the competing values of Christian and pagan custom. Unnecessary excursions into the present tense&#x2014;mostly at the beginning of chapters&#x2014;mar the tone of the narrative, which is otherwise nicely ironic about its self-serving and conflicting sources. These sources cannot definitively reveal whether Emma made her choices as a wife, mother and political actor out of calculation or necessity, but she was a woman who clearly took what fortune offered and built the best life she could from it. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Until his death in 1891, Melville was known as the author of <i>Typee</i> (1846) and <i>Omoo</i> (1847)&#x2015;both semiautobiographical travel books, and literary sensations because of Melville's sensual description of the South Sea islanders. (A transatlantic furor raged over whether the books were fact or fiction.) His most famous character was Fayaway&#x2015;not Captain Ahab, not the White Whale, not Bartleby, and definitely not Billy Budd, whose story remained unpublished until 1924. </p><p> <i>Herman Melville, 1819-1851</i> is the first of a two-volume project constituting the fullest biography of Melville ever published. Hershel Parker, co-editor of the Northwestern-Newberry Edition of <i>The Writings of Herman Melville</i>, reveals with extraordinary precision the twisted turmoil of Melville's life, beginning with his Manhattan boyhood where, surrounded by tokens of heroic ancestors, he witnessed his father's dissipation of two family fortunes. Having attended the best Manhattan boys' schools, Herman was withdrawn from classes at the Albany Academy at age 12, shortly after his father's death. Outwardly docile, inwardly rebellious, he worked where his family put him&#x2015;in a bank, in his brother's fur store&#x2015;until, at age 21, he escaped his responsibilities to his impoverished mother and his six siblings and sailed to the Pacific as a whaleman.</p><p>A year and a half after his return, Melville was a famous author, thanks to the efforts of his older brother in finding publishers. Three years later he was married, the man of the family, a New Yorker&#x2015;and still not equipped to do the responsible thing: write more books in the vein that had proven so popular. After the disappointing failure of <i>Mardi</i>, which he had hoped would prove him a literary genius, Melville wrote two more saleable books in four months&#x2015; <i>Redburn</i> and <i>White-Jacket</i>.

When Melville made his debut in England, reviewers thought his books must have been the products of an esteemed English gentleman disguising himself under rough Yankee cloth. It was simply inconceivable that any American could produce such noble prose, or that any author could have lived the briny life Melville describes. Hershel Parker finds that life not unimaginable, but difficult to distill. His book is monumental in size and definitive in detail. Readers looking for a digestible portait of one of America&#39;s favorite authors may find this well researched book a bit rich (remember this is just Volume I), although it does reveal many new insights into Melville&#39;s life and family background. Regardless, Parker&#39;s book is a significant scholarly work and essential to serious students of this American master.<p>From the Associate General Editor of The Writings of Herman Melville, the first of a two-volume project constituting the fullest biography of Melville ever published.</p></p><h2>A Beginner&#39;s Guide To Day Trading Online</h2><p>The president of TriPoint Trading provides reality-checked views and strategies concerning online brokers and electronic trading.

October 13, 1990, was a red-letter day for the Glascock County High School football team. On that crisp, fall Friday night, the Panthers soundly defeated Long County High 14-0. It was the second time Glascock had beaten Long County that season. But that Friday the 13th proved to be an unlucky day for the team from tiny Gibson, Georgia, as it marked the last time they&#39;d win a game all year. In fact, the Panthers wouldn&#39;t win a game the following year...or any in &#39;92, &#39;93, &#39;94, &#39;95, &#39;96, &#39;97, or &#39;98. Thus began the longest losing streak in the history of Georgia high school football. Season after season the Panthers struggled, only to lose game after game. With fewer than 100 boys in the entire high school, the &#39;pickins,&#39; as they say, were slim. Nevertheless, each Friday night, all 15 players kept giving it all they had. Unfortunately, that wasn&#39;t enough. With most boys playing both offense and defense, there just wasn&#39;t enough energy in their adolescent bodies to outlast their opponents. They simply couldn&#39;t produce a win. The streak swelled to 87 straight losses. Now, imagine if through some miracle of time travel, Moses could step out of the Bible and walk into the Panther locker room after one of those heartbreaking losses. Moses might take a knee, look each one of those teenagers in the eyes, and say: &#39;Boys, I know exactly how you feel.&#39; Now, you remember Moses. He&#39;s the guy who delivered Israel from Pharaoh, received the Ten Commandments, wrote the first five books in the Bible, and courageously led an entire nation for 40 years, ultimately taking them to the Promised Land. If that&#39;s the Moses you recall, then your memory serves you correctly. But that was the &#39;public Moses,&#39; the image his agent might sell to a prospective nation needing immediate redemption. That&#39;s the official portrait. You know, the 8 x 10 glossy. There&#39;s another Moses. Same guy, just a different season of his life. We know his famous exploits, successes, and accomplishments, but what about his foul-ups, failures, and disappointments? Is it really possible that Israel&#39;s redeemer could identify with a group of high school boys? Is it really possible that Moses could identify with us, in our own times of struggle, doubt, and failure? Did Moses ever have a losing streak? Let&#39;s take a closer look at this larger-than-life Bible character. BACKGROUND CHECK Moses was born during a difficult time in his nation&#39;s history, a time when more than a million Hebrew slaves lived in Egypt. With so many slaves living in his country, Egypt&#39;s ruler, Pharaoh (possibly Thutmoses I, or &#39;King Tut&#39; to us), became very nervous. Concerned about a possible slave revolution, he devised a sinister plan to kill all male newborn babies. (Nice guy, huh?). &#39;Just throw &#39;em into the river,&#39; he declared. However, his master plan had one glitch. Jewish midwives assisting in the birthing process feared God more than any human leader, and they were protecting the newborn infants. It was the world&#39;s first Right to Life movement. God blessed these women for honoring him in this way, and the Jewish population kept growing. One of those babies was born to a woman named Jochebed. After keeping her boy&#39;s birth a secret for three months, she could hide him no longer. So this mother made a difficult decision. She wove a &#39;boat-basket,&#39; laid her baby inside, and placed the basket along the bank of the Nile River, hoping someone would find her son. And someone did. By &#39;chance,&#39; while bathing in the river, Pharaoh&#39;s daughter found the basket. Feeling compassion for the child, she adopted him and began raising him as an Egyptian. Little is known about Moses&#39; next 40 years, but the Book of Acts tells us, &#39;Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and he was powerful in speech and action&#39; (Acts 7:22). In other words, Moses received the best education money could buy. An Egyptian education included studying hieroglyphics, mathematics, science, medicine, astrology, the doctrines of Egyptian religion, and interpretation of dreams. Moses probably spoke several languages and was destined for an influential government job in the mightiest nation on earth. He really was the &#39;Prince of Egypt.&#39; MID-LIFE MURDERER However, later on something began stirring within this Hebrew hunk. Maybe it was a midlife crisis, but Moses wanted to know about his Jewish heritage and identity. Feeling a strong kinship with his people, he decided he&#39;d rather live as a peasant Jew than as an heir to Egypt&#39;s treasures. Pharaoh must have thought Moses was crazy. How could he possibly do this, considering all Egypt had done for him? There was only one way. By faith. Moses took a huge gamble on God, choosing to go with his gut feeling instead of Pharaoh&#39;s fortune. By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh&#39;s daughter. He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time. He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward. (Hebrews 11:24-26) &#39;Greater value than the treasures of Egypt?&#39; Hello? Moses, do you realize what you&#39;re giving up? Think of all the good you could do for your people as an influential Egyptian politician. But you&#39;re throwing it all away for life as a slave! Where&#39;s the logic in that? So Moses traded his cool, clean, comfortable bedroom in Pharaoh&#39;s fortress for the sweaty heat of a dirty mud hut. Lavish meals, servants, perks, popularity, and pleasure were all yesterday&#39;s news. Past tense. History. No more hobnobbing with heads of state. No more luxury, entertainment, or &#39;easy street.&#39; The tenement tents of Hebrew-town would now replace his bird&#39;s-eye view of the pyramids. And to think, he traded it all away for a faint, faded promise that God made to Moses&#39; forefather Abraham hundreds of years before. &#39;Through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed.&#39; (Genesis 22:18) Moses had it all, but he gave it up because he believed God would bring salvation through the Jews some day. Some might label him a loser for taking a gamble like that. Later, Moses saw a fellow Hebrew being beaten by an Egyptian, and something snapped inside. Pouncing on the man like a desert scorpion, Moses murdered him in rage and then quickly buried the body in the sizzling sand. Unfortunately, news of the murder reached Pharaoh, and a posse was formed. If caught, Moses would surely face a tortuous death...such as being buried alive with thousands of flesh-eating beetles. But let&#39;s not go there, okay? Now with a price on his head, Moses fled to Midian, a few hundred miles away. Following his long journey, the 40-year-old fugitive quenched his thirst at a desert well (Exodus 2:15).</p><h2>The Children&#39;s Blizzard</h2><p><p>&#x201c;David Laskin deploys historical fact of the finest grain to tell the story of a monstrous blizzard that caught the settlers of the Great Plains utterly by surprise. Using the storm as a lens, Laskin captures the brutal, heartbreaking folly of this chapter in America&#x2019;s history, and along the way delves into the freakish physics of extreme cold.

The disastrous blizzard of 1888 revealed that their free homestead was not a paradise but a hard, unforgiving place governed by natural forces they neither understood nor controlled, and America&#x2019;s heartland would never be the same.</p><p>This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more.</p></p><p><p><em>The gripping story of an epic prairie snowstorm that killed hundreds of newly arrived settlers and cast a shadow on the promise of the American frontier.</em></p><p>January 12, 1888, began as an unseasonably warm morning across Nebraska, the Dakotas, and Minnesota, the weather so mild that children walked to school without coats and gloves. But that afternoon, without warning, the atmosphere suddenly, violently changed. One moment the air was calm; the next the sky exploded in a raging chaos of horizontal snow and hurricane-force winds. Temperatures plunged as an unprecedented cold front ripped through the center of the continent.</p><p>By Friday morning, January 13, some five hundred people lay dead on the drifted prairie, many of them children who had perished on their way home from country schools. In a few terrifying hours, the hopes of the pioneers had been blasted by the bitter realities of their harsh environment. Recent immigrants from Germany, Norway, Denmark, and the Ukraine learned that their free homestead was not a paradise but a hard, unforgiving place governed by natural forces they neither understood nor controlled.</p><p>With the storm as its dramatic, heartbreaking focal point, <em>The Children's Blizzard</em> captures this pivotal moment in American history by tracing the stories of five families who were forever changed that day. Drawing on family interviews and memoirs, as well as hundreds of contemporary accounts, David Laskin creates an intimate picture of the men, women, and children who made choices they would regret as long as they lived. Here too is a meticulous account of the evolution of the storm and the vain struggle of government forecasters to track its progress.</p><p>The blizzard of January 12, 1888, is still remembered on the prairie. Children fled that day while their teachers screamed into the relentless roar. Husbands staggered into the blinding wind in search of wives. Fathers collapsed while trying to drag their children to safety. In telling the story of this meteorological catastrophe, the deadliest blizzard ever to hit the prairie states, David Laskin has produced a masterful portrait of a tragic crucible in the settlement of the American heartland.</p><p>David Laskin is the author of <em>The Children's Blizzard</em>, winner of the Midwest Booksellers' Choice Award for nonfiction and the Washington State Book Award.

Writing in a lively, friendly style, which intertwines personal anecdotes with how-to advice, she explains the difference between angelic helpers (including the big guns, the archangels) and spirit guides. She then breaks down the latter into smaller groups such as teacher guides, healer guides, etc., explaining the particular province of each group and offering advice on how to call upon them. Later chapters explain what the guides can--and cannot--do. This book certainly comes under the category of "everything you wanted to know about," and it will delight believers. The less convinced may wonder how the multitude of helpers avoid bumping into each other. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Overlooking the Thames, the mansion is flanked by two wings and surrounded by lavish gardens. Throughout its storied history, Cliveden has been a setting for misbehavior, intrigue, and passion&#x2014;from its salacious, deadly beginnings in the seventeenth century to the 1960s Profumo Affair, the sex scandal that toppled the British government. Now, in this immersive chronicle, the manor&#x2019;s current mistress, Natalie Livingstone, opens the doors to this prominent house and lets the walls do the talking.<br><br> Built during the reign of Charles II by the Duke of Buckingham, Cliveden attracted notoriety as a luxurious retreat in which the duke could conduct his scandalous affair with the ambitious courtesan Anna Maria, Countess of Shrewsbury. In 1668, Anna Maria&#x2019;s cuckolded husband, the Earl of Shrewsbury, challenged Buckingham to a duel. Buckingham killed Shrewsbury and claimed Anna Maria as his prize, making her the first mistress of Cliveden.<br><br> Through the centuries, other enigmatic and indomitable women would assume stewardship over the estate, including Elizabeth, Countess of Orkney and illicit lover of William III, who became one of England&#x2019;s wealthiest women; Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, the queen that Britain was promised and then denied; Harriet, Duchess of Sutherland, confidante of Queen Victoria and a glittering society hostess turned political activist; and the American-born Nancy Astor, the first female member of Parliament, who described herself as an &#x201c;ardent feminist&#x201d; and welcomed controversy. Though their privileges were extraordinary, in Livingstone&#x2019;s hands, their struggles and sacrifices are universal.<br><br> Cliveden weathered renovation and restoration, world conflicts and cold wars, societal shifts and technological advances. Rich in historical and architectural detail, <i>The Mistresses of Cliveden</i> is a tale of sex and power, and of the exceptional women who evaded, exploited, and confronted the expectations of their times.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Mistresses of Cliveden<br></i></b><br>&#x201c;Theatrical festivities, political jockeying and court intrigues are deftly described with a verve and attention to domestic comforts that show the author at her best. . . .

In springtime and summer, revellers flocked to Barn Elms with their bottles, baskets and chairs, recorded the diarist Samuel Pepys, &#x2018;to sup under the trees, by the waterside&#x2019;, but in winter the ground next to the Thames was frozen and deserted. Nevertheless, there was still activity on the river. Nearby Putney was famous for its fishery and was also the point at which travellers going west from London disembarked from the ferry and continued by coach. The harried cries of watermen and the shouts of fishermen returning from dawn trips filled the air as Buckingham neared his destination.<br><br> The grounds of the old manor of Barn Elms lay on a curve in the river just west of Putney. The land was divided into narrow agricultural plots &#x2013; some open, others fenced off by walls or hedgerows. Pepys recorded that the duel took place in a &#x2018;close&#x2019;, meaning a yard next to a building or an enclosed field &#x2013; somewhere screened off from passers-by.&nbsp;<br><br> But as his horse&#x2019;s hoofs thundered along the icy riverbank, Buckingham&#x2019;s thoughts lay on a more distant turf. Anna Maria, the woman who had provoked the duel, was 270 miles away, in self-�imposed exile in a convent in France. Nine years before, in 1659, Anna Maria Brudenell had married Francis Talbot, 11th Earl of Shrewsbury, but the union had been an unhappy one. He was 36, a wealthy but sedate landowner; she was a pleasure-loving 16-year-old already conscious of her seductive charms. Anna Maria kept a series of lovers but Shrewsbury turned a blind eye, making himself a laughing stock at court. During a trip to York in 1666, she began a new affair, this time with the flamboyant courtier George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, and the following summer sexual rivalry between him and another of her paramours, the hot-headed rake Henry Killigrew, exploded in a violent scuffle. This very public fracas made it abundantly clear that Anna Maria had been serially unfaithful, and Shrewsbury&#x2019;s failure to challenge either man to a duel was seen as a dereliction of his role as a noble husband. Anna Maria fled to France in shame.&nbsp;<br><br> Amid reports that Buckingham was actually hiding Anna Maria in England, Shrewsbury at last summoned the courage to defend his marriage and his name. He challenged Buckingham to a duel and the duke eagerly accepted. Anna Maria exerted an extraordinary hold over a great number of men but she quite simply possessed the duke. &#x2018;Love is like Moses&#x2019; serpent,&#x2019; he lamented in his commonplace book, &#x2018;it devours all the rest.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br> Pepys reported that King Charles II had tried to dissuade Buckingham from fighting the duel but the message was never received. Even if it had been delivered, Buckingham would probably have taken little heed of the king&#x2019;s wishes. Charles II was more like his brother than his monarch. Buckingham&#x2019;s father, also George Villiers, had been made a duke by Charles I and, when Villiers senior was assassinated in 1628, the king took the Buckingham children into his household. Young George became a close friend of the future king and many of Charles&#x2019;s happiest childhood memories involved Buckingham. The pair spent their student days at Cambridge University and their names appear side by side in the records of matriculation at Trinity College. Buckingham felt little obligation to defer to the king, while Charles tended to turn a blind eye to Buckingham&#x2019;s reckless conduct.&nbsp;<br><br> Unknown to Shrewsbury, Buckingham had another reason to be riding to Barn Elms that January day in 1668. Shortly after the start of his affair with Anna Maria, Buckingham had viewed a magnificent estate next to the Thames. The site, then owned by the Manfield family, was within easy boating distance of London and included two hunting lodges set in 160 acres of arable land and woods. The estate was known as Cliveden, or Cliffden, after the chalk cliffs that rose above the river. From the lodges the ground dropped sharply towards the Thames, and on the far side of the river flooded water meadows and open land spread out for miles beyond. There had once been a well-stocked deer park on the site and Buckingham knew he could restore the estate to its former glory. He intended to replace the lodge with a large house that would boast the best views in the kingdom.<br><br> Buckingham bought Cliveden with the pleasures of the flesh at the forefront of his mind. This, he fantasised, would be his grand love nest with Anna Maria, a place for them to freely indulge in their affair &#x2013; hunting by day, dancing by night. It was Buckingham&#x2019;s obsession with Anna Maria and his dream of a gilded life with her at Cliveden that led him to accept Shrewsbury&#x2019;s challenge.<br><br> Buckingham&#x2019;s fight with Shrewsbury was not to be an impulsive brawl of the sort seen every night across London&#x2019;s streets and taverns, but a carefully calibrated episode of violence. Although there had been medieval precedents for settling disputes through combat, the duel of honour was essentially a Renaissance invention, imported from Italy. Duelling formalised conflicts between aristocrats, replacing cycles of revenge, usually romantic in nature, with a single, rule-bound encounter. Its outcome served to resolve and annul any other grievances. The duel was part of a new court culture, which placed heavy emphasis on civility and courtesy; when these principles were ignored, duelling provided a means of redress. In the 1660s, after the monarchy was restored, duels became more common and attracted significant public interest and press comment, even if the participants lacked any kind of celebrity status.8 Charles II did issue an anti-duelling proclamation in 1660: &#x2018;It is become too frequent,&#x2019; this stated, &#x2018;especially with Persons of quality, under a vain pretence of Honour, to take upon them to be the Revengers of their private quarrels, by Duel and single Combat.&#x2019; In reality, however, Charles II had no moral objection to the culture of romantic fighting, and in the absence of effective legislation from Parliament, duels were judged on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp;<br><br> A duel was conventionally initiated with a challenge from the aggrieved party, whose complaint could be anything from the monumental to the trivial. The philosopher Thomas Hobbes wrote that men fought duels &#x2018;for trifles, as a word, a smile, a different opinion, and any other sign of undervalue in their Kindred, their Friend, their Nation, their Profession or their Name&#x2019;. Even if a challenge were accepted, the duel itself could be avoided, either by one of the parties backing down or by a third party intervening. When a fight did take place, the duellists were each required to select two men as &#x2018;seconds&#x2019;. In earlier times the seconds had merely an auxiliary role, carrying weapons and arbitrating, but by the 1660s it had become fashionable for them to engage at the same time as the main combatants &#x2013; turning the duel into a ritualised piece of gang violence. Nominally, the aim was to prove one&#x2019;s honour by exposing oneself to danger, not to kill the opponent, but inevitably some duels ended in serious injury or death.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Real 12 Days of Christmas: The Story Behind the Song</h2><p>This book presents the reader with the real story behind the popular Christmas carol &#34;The Twelve Days of Christmas.&#34;</p><p>What do eleven lords a-leaping have to do with Jesus&#39; disciples?

They are hawks in the form of men, and the one who leads them is a being doubly transformed: lost and found, human and bird; youngest of them, yet strangely old. He has endured, and in this endurance he has been forged anew. He has seen a world beyond this one. He has glimpsed the face of a new god.<br> <br>He is at peace with himself, and so he will wage war.<br> <br>Faster they come, the spiral narrowing, the three almost as one, their coats mantling in the chill fall air; and not a whisper of their approach, not a passing shadow nor a sparrow startled, only the stillness of a world waiting to be shattered, and the perfect balance of a life, perhaps, to be saved and a life, perhaps, to be ended.<br> <br>The clouds part, pierced by a shaft of light that catches them in flight, as though they have attracted, however briefly, the attention of a deity long slumbering but now awake, roused by martial clamor and the raising of armies in the name of the Captain, the One Who Waits Behind the Glass, the God of Wasps.<br> <br>And the old deity will set His child against them, and the hawks will follow.<br> <br>IT WAS A LONG time since the Gray Man had considered the possibility of being caught, for the Gray Man did not truly exist. He had no physical form. He dwelt alongside another, sharing the same skin, and only at the final breath might there have been a glimpse of the essence of his true nature, although even then he preferred to remain unseen, concealed by darkness. He was not above causing pain, although this was as much a matter of whim as any particular tastes that he might have possessed. A death was only the beginning, which was why he had survived undetected for so long. He could make a kill last for years. Physical pain was finite, for ultimately the body would surrender the soul, but emotional agony was capable of infinite variations, and the subtlest of modifications might release from the wound a new torrent of distress.<br> <br>In the persona that he presented to the world, the Gray Man was a reverse chameleon. His name was Roger Ormsby, and he was small, colorful, and greatly liked. He was in his early sixties, with an impish humor. His hair and beard were white, but neatly trimmed. He proudly carried before him his little potbelly, like a happily expectant mother demonstrating the pleasure she takes in her burden. He favored red suspenders and vests of unusual design. He wore tweed in winter and linen in summer, preferring creams and tans but offsetting them with tastefully bright ties and handkerchiefs. He could play the piano, and waltz and two-step with ease, but inside Ormsby was a foul thing animating him as a puppeteer works a marionette, and only an expert might have detected the sterility of his renditions of beloved classics as his fingers moved across the keys, or the joyless precision of every move he made on a dance floor.<br> <br>Ormsby did not discuss politics or religion. He took only frivolous subjects seriously, and as a consequence was much valued as a dinner guest. He was a happy widower, faithful to the memory of his departed wife to the extent that he would do no more than flirt with the less lonely widows of Champaign, Illinois, but not so in love with the ghost of his departed spouse as to allow the loss of her to cloud his spirit or the spirits of others. He was always in demand as a companion for theater, movies, and the occasional light opera, and the absence of a sexual component to his relationships meant that he moved in and out of social situations with ease. He was a Friend of the Library, a member of the Audubon Society, a regular fixture at lectures on local history, and a generous&#x2014;but not overgenerous&#x2014;donor to good causes. True, there were some who disliked him, for no man can be loved by all, but in general such naysayers were regarded by the majority as willfully ornery, unable to accept that someone might simply be a force for contentment in the world.<br> <br>And so Roger Ormsby bobbed through life in his vibrant plumage, advertising his presence, hiding nothing, but when he closed his front door behind him the artificial light in his eyes was suffocated, and the face of the Gray Man was pendent like a dead moon in the blackness of his pupils.<br> <br>This is what Roger Ormsby did&#x2014;or, if you wish, what the Gray Man did, for they were two aspects of the same entity, like a coat and its lining. He typically targeted his victims carefully, spending months in preparation. He had been known to engage in crimes of opportunity, but they were riskier now than they once were, because cameras were everywhere. In addition, it was difficult to gauge just what one might be appropriating in such a situation, for Ormsby required a very particular set of social circumstances from his victims. They couldn&#x2019;t be loners, isolated from their families and friends. He did not desire discards. The more beloved they were, the better. He wanted offspring who were cherished. He wanted teenagers from happy homes. He wanted good mothers of children beyond the age of infancy. He wanted emotional engagement.<br> <br>He wanted many lives that he could slowly and painstakingly destroy over a period of years, even decades.<br> <br>Ormsby made people disappear, then watched as those who loved them were left to wonder at their fate. He understood the half-life of hope: it is not despair that destroys us, but its opposite. Hope is the winding, despair the unwinding. Despair brings with it the possibility of an ending. Taken to the extreme, its logical conclusion is death. But hope sustains. It can be exploited.<br> <br>Ormsby&#x2019;s actions had caused some to take their own lives, but he considered this a failure, both on his own part and theirs. The ones he killed were merely the first victims, and also the least interesting to him. He liked to watch those who remained as they tried to cope with what had been visited upon them. He knew that they would wake each morning and briefly forget what they had lost: a mother, a son, a daughter. (Ormsby avoided taking adult men. He was stronger than he looked, but not so much that he believed he could tackle a grown man, especially not as he grew older.) Then, seconds after waking, they would remember again, and this was where the pleasure lay for Ormsby.<br> <br>He was not above goading, reminding, but that was a dangerous business. He had sent items to relatives in the mail&#x2014;a necklace, a watch, a child&#x2019;s shoe&#x2014;to enjoy the commotion that followed. He had forced children that he had taken to write letters to their mothers and fathers, informing them that they were in good health and being looked after. (Adults, too, might be persuaded to write similar missives, but only under threat of physical harm.) He might wait years before sending such notes, depending on the age of the child and the reaction of the parents. He dropped the letters in mailboxes far from home, often when he was on vacation, and always ensured that he was not overlooked by cameras.<br> <br>The Internet made it easier for him to monitor the progress of his real victims, but Ormsby was wary of leaving an electronic trail. He concealed his searches amid random examinations of newspapers and magazines, often in public libraries or the kind of cybercafes frequented by immigrants. He did not attend public gatherings for the disappeared, or church services at which the congregation prayed for their safe return, because he believed the authorities monitored such events. It was usually enough for Ormsby to know that the suffering he had inflicted continued unabated. If nothing else, the Gray Man had a vivid imagination. This was how Ormsby could survive for so long without killing: as the years went by, so too his store of victims increased. He could dip in and out of destroyed lives. He was an emotional vampire.<br> <br>Now, as he drove home, he thought that this metaphor had a pleasing precision under the circumstances. He recalled a scene from Bram Stoker&#x2019;s Dracula, in which the Count returns to his castle and throws to his three vampire brides an infant contained in a sack. At that moment, the trunk of Ormsby&#x2019;s car also contained a child in a sack. Her name was Charlotte Littleton. She was nine years old, and represented one of his rare crimes of opportunity: a child playing with a ball as the afternoon sunlight died, an open gate, the ball drifting into an empty street of big houses set back from the road . . .<br> <br>Good fortune: God&#x2014;if He existed&#x2014;finding His attention briefly distracted.<br> <br>And inside, the Gray Man danced.</p><h2>unChristian: What a New Generation Really Thinks about Christianity... and Why It Matters</h2><p>Based on groundbreaking Barna Group research, <i>unChristian</i> uncovers the negative perceptions young people have of Christianity and explores what can be done to reverse them.</p><p>Christianity has an image problem.<br><br>Christians are supposed to represent Christ to the world.

The two women were unlikely companions, but soon the laughter of their youth filled the gloomy place. Yet over them both loomed the shadow of Malcolm, whose dark desires were to sow the seeds of a shocking secret that would lead in time to a darkened, locked attic room!</p><p>Virginia Andrews lived in Norfolk, Virginia, studied art and worked as a fashion illustrator, commercial artist and portrait painter. Flowers in the Attic, based on a true story, was her first novel. It became an immediate bestseller on both sides of the Atlantic when it was first published in 1979.

To be opened twenty years after my death.<br><br>I have been forced to leave this record.

It was a magical miniature world, with beautiful tiny porcelain dolls, furniture, even paintings and chandeliers and rugs all made to scale. But the house was enclosed in a glass case and I was never allowed to touch the family inside -- indeed, I was not even permitted to touch the glass case, for fear of leaving smudges. Dainty things had always been at peril in my large hands, and the dollhouse was for me to admire but never to touch.<br><br>I kept it on an oak table under the sash of stained glass windows in my bedroom. The sun coming through the tinted windows always spread a soft, rainbow colored sky over the tiny universe and put the light of happiness into the faces of the miniature family. Even the servants in the kitchen, the butler dressed in white livery who stood near the entrance door, and the nanny in the nursery all wore looks of contentment.<br><br>That was as it should be, as it should always be -- as I fervently hoped and prayed it would be for me someday. That miniature world was without shadows; for, even on overcast days, when clouds hung their gloom outside, the tinted-glass windows magically turned the gray light into rainbows.<br><br>The real world, my own world, seemed always to be gray, without rainbows. Gray for my eyes, which I had always been told were too stern, gray for my hopes, gray for the old maid no one wanted in the deck of cards. At twenty-four, I was an old maid, already a spinster. It seemed I intimidated eligible young men with my height and intelligence. It seemed that the rainbow world of love and marriage and babies would always be as closed off to me as that dollhouse I so admired. For it was only in make-believe that my hopes took wing.<br><br>In my fantasies I was pretty, lighthearted, charming, like the other young women I had met but never befriended. Mine was a lonely life, filled mostly with books and dreams. And though I did not talk about it, I clung to the small hope my dear mother had given me just before she died.<br><br>"Life is very much like a garden, Olivia. And people are like tiny seeds, nurtured by love and friendship and caring. And if enough time and care are spent, they bloom into gorgeous flowers. And sometimes, even an old, neglected plant left in a yard gone to seed will unexpectedly burst into blossom. These are the most precious, the most cherished blossoms of all. You will be that sort of flower, Olivia. It may take time, but your flowering will come."<br><br>How I missed my optimistic mother. I was sixteen when she died -- just when I most needed to have those woman-to-woman talks with her that would tell me how<br>to win a man's heart, how to be like her: respectable, competent, yet a woman in every way. My mother was forever involved in one thing or another, and in everything she was competent and in charge. She threaded her way through each crisis, and when one ended, there was always another to replace it. My father seemed content that she was busy. It mattered not with what.<br><br>He often said that just because women weren't involved in serious business, that didn't mean they should be idle. They had their "womanly" things to do.<br><br>Yet, when it came to me, he encouraged me to go to business school. It seemed right and proper that I would become his private accountant, that he would give me a place in his den, a manly room with one wall covered with firearms and another with pictures from his hunting and fishing expeditions, a room that always had the odor of cigar smoke and whiskey, its dark brown rug the most worn-looking of any rug in the house. He set aside a portion of his large black oakwood desk for me to work meticulously on his accounts, his business expenses, his employees' wages, and even his household expenses. Working with my father, I often felt more like the son he had always longed for -- but never got -- than the daughter I was. Oh, I did want to please, but it seemed I would never be just what anyone wanted.<br><br>He used to say I would be a great help to any husband, and I used to believe that was why he was so determined I would get a business education and have that experience. He didn't come out and say it in so many words, but I could hear them anyway -- a woman six feet tall needed something more to capture a man's love.<br><br>Yes, I was six feet tall; I had shot up as a teenager, much to my dismay, to giant proportions. I was the beanstalk in Jack's garden. I was the giant. There was nothing dainty or fragile about me.<br><br>I had my mother's auburn hair, but my shoulders were too wide and my bosom large. I often stood before my mirror and wished my arms shorter. My gray eyes were too long and catlike and my nose was too sharp. My lips were thin, my complexion pale and gray. Gray, gray, gray. How I longed to be pretty and bright. But when I sat before my vanilla marble vanity table trying to blush and to flutter my eyelashes -- look flirtatious -- I managed only to look a fool. I didn't want to look empty-headed and silly, yet I couldn't help but sit before the glass-encased dollhouse and study the pretty, delicate porcelain face of the tiny wife. How I wished it were my face. Maybe then this would be my world.<br><br>But it was not.<br><br>And so I left my hope encased with the porcelain figures and went about my way.<br><br>If my father had really expected to make me more attractive to a man by providing me with an education and practical business experience, he must have been sorely disappointed in the result. Gentlemen came and went, all coming because of his manipulations, I discovered; and still I was yet to be courted and loved. I was always afraid that my money, my father's money, money I would inherit, would bring a man to the door pretending to be in love with me. I think my father feared the same thing, because he came to me one day and said, "I have written into my will that whatever money you receive shall be only yours and yours to do with what you like. No husband will ever expect to take control of your fortune simply by marrying you."<br><br>He made his announcement and left before I could even respond. Then he screened any candidates for my romance carefully, exposing me only to the highest class of gentleman, men of some fortune themselves. I had yet to meet one I didn't tower over, or one who wouldn't scowl at the things I said. It seemed I'd die a spinster.<br><br>But my father wouldn't have it so.<br><br>"There's a young man coming to dinner tonight," he began one Friday morning late in April, "who I must say is one of the most impressive I've met. I want you to wear that blue dress you had made for yourself last Easter."<br><br>"Oh, Father." It was on the tip of my tongue to say, "Why bother," but he anticipated my reaction.<br><br>"Don't argue about it, and for heaven's sake don't start in on the woman suffrage movement when we're at the table."<br><br>My eyes flamed. He knew how I hated to be bridled like one of his horses.<br><br>"A man no sooner shows some interest in you than you challenge the most treasured of manly privileges. It never fails. The blue dress," he repeated, and pivoted and left before I could offer an argument.<br><br>It seemed pointless to me to go through the rituals at my vanity table. I shampooed my hair vigorously and then sat down to brush it a hundred times, softening it and pinning it back neatly but not too harsh with the ivory combs my father had given me for Christmas the previous year.<br><br>My father didn't know or even seem to recognize that I had commissioned the "blue dress" because I wanted a dress that looked like the dresses women wore in fashion photographs. The bodice was low enough to expose some of the fullness of my bosom, and the tight waist gave me a suggestion of an "hourglass" figure. It was made of silk, and the material was exceptionally soft and had a sheen to it like nothing else I owned. The sleeves were cut just above the elbow. I thought that made my arms look shorter.<br><br>I put on my mother's blue sapphire pendant, which I thought made my neck look slimmer. There was a blush in my cheeks but I couldn't say if it was there because of my healthy body or because of my nervousness. I was nervous. I'd been through enough of those evenings before -- watching the man's face fall as he rose to greet me and I towered over him.<br><br>I was merely rehearsing for another failure.<br><br>By the time I went downstairs, my father's guest had arrived. They were together in the den. I heard my father's loud laughter, and then I heard the gentleman's voice, low but deeply resonant, the voice of a man with some confidence. I pressed my palms against my hips to dry off the wetness and proceeded to the doorway of the den.<br><br>The moment I appeared, Malcolm Neal Foxworth stood up and my heart skipped a beat. He was at least six foot two and easily the most handsome young man who had ever come to our house.<br><br>"Malcolm," my father said, "I'm proud to present my lovely daughter."<br><br>He took my hand and said, "Charmed, Miss Winfield."<br><br>I was looking directly into his sky-blue eyes. And he was gazing just as forthrightly into mine. I'd never believed in schoolgirl romantic notions such as love at first sight, but I felt his gaze slide right over my heart and lodge in the pit of my stomach.<br><br>He had flaxen blond hair, a little longer in the back than most men wore, but the strands were brushed neatly and looked heavenly light. He had a strong Roman nose and a thin straight mouth. Broad shouldered, slim-hipped, he had an almost athletic air about him. And I could tell by the way he was gazing at me, with almost a wry smile of amusement, that he was quite accustomed to women falling into a flutter about him. Well, I thought, I mustn't give him something more to be amused at Olivia Winfield. Of course, such a man would hardly give me the time of day, and I would have to get through another evening of Father's doomed matchmaking. I shook his hand firmly, smiled back, and quickly looked away.<br><br>After we were introduced, my father explained that Malcolm had come to New London from Yale, where he had attended a class reunion. He was interested in investing in the shipbuilding industry because he believed that with the Great War over, the markets for exporting would develop. From what I learned of his background that night, I understood that he already owned a number of cloth factories, had commanding interest in a few banks, and owned some lumber mills in Virginia. He was in business with his father, but his father, even though he was only fifty-five, was distracted. I didn't learn until later what that meant.<br><br>At dinner I tried to be the polite, quiet observer that my father wanted me to be, the way my mother used to be. Margaret and Philip, our servants, served an elegant dinner of beef Wellington, a menu my father had chosen himself. He did so only on special occasions. I thought my father was being quite obvious when he said, "Olivia's a college graduate, you know. She has a business degree and handles a major portion of my bookkeeping."<br><br>"Really?" Malcolm seemed genuinely impressed. His cerulean blue eyes brightened even more with interest and I felt he was taking a second, more serious look at me. "Do you enjoy the work, Miss Winfield?"<br><br>I shot a glance at my father, who sat back in his high-backed light-maple chair and nodded as if prompting my responses. I did so want this Malcolm Foxworth to like me, but I was determined to be who I was.<br><br>"It's better to fill your time with sensible and productive things," I said. "Even for a woman."<br><br>My father's smile faded, but Malcolm's widened. "I totally agree," he said. He didn't turn back to my father. "I find most so-called beautiful women vapid and rather silly. It's as if their good looks are enough to see them through life. I prefer intelligent women who know how to think for themselves, women who can be real assets to their husbands."<br><br>My father cleared his throat. "Yes, yes," he said, and turned the conversation back to the shipping industry. He had it from good sources that the merchant marine fleet, built for the war effort, would soon be offered to private owners. His topic took Malcolm's attention for most of the dinner, but nevertheless, I felt Malcolm's eyes on me and at times, when I looked up at him, he was smiling at me.<br><br>Never had I sat with one of my father's guests and been so enraptured. Never had I felt as welcome at the table. Malcolm was polite to my father, but it was clear to me that he wanted to talk more to me.<br><br>To me!<br><br>The handsomest man ever to come to our house was interested in me? But he could have a hundred beautiful girls to adore him forever. Why should he be interested in a Plain Jane such as I? But oh how I wanted to believe I wasn't imagining all those side glances, those times he asked me to pass him things he could have easily gotten himself, the way he tried to bring me into the conversation. Perhaps, just for a few hours I could allow my slight bud of hope to blossom. Just for tonight! Tomorrow I'd let it gray again.<br><br>After dinner Malcolm and my father adjourned to the den to smoke their cigars and talk more about the investments Malcolm wanted to make. With them my hopes, so briefly flowered, so quickly withered. Of course Malcolm wasn't interested in me -- he was interested in business with my father. They would be in there for the rest of the evening. I might as well retire to my room to read that new novel that was attracting attention, Edith Wharton's <i>Age of Innocence.</i> But I decided instead to bring the book down to the sitting room and read by the Tiffany lamp, happy to see Malcolm just to say good-bye.<br><br>It was very quiet on our street that time of evening, but I looked up to see a couple walking arm in arm. It was the way the husband and wife in my glass-encased doll world would walk if they could escape their imprisonment, I thought. I watched them until they disappeared around the corner. How I wished I could someday walk with a man like that -- a man like Malcolm. But it was not to be. It seemed God was deaf to my hopes and prayers for love. I sighed. As I turned back to my book, I realized all I could know of love and life would be from books.<br><br>Then I spied Malcolm in the doorway. Why, he had been watching me! He stood so straight and still, his shoulders drawn back, his head high. There was a calculating look in his eyes, as if he were sizing me up unawares, but I didn't know what to make of it.<br><br>"Oh!" My surprise brought heat to my cheeks. My heart began to thump so loudly, I thought he might even hear it across the room.<br><br>"It is a lovely evening," he said. "Could I interest you in a walk?"<br><br>For a moment I just stared. He wanted to take me out walking!<br><br>"Yes," I said. I could see he liked the way I came to a quick decision. I didn't try to flutter my eyelashes or act uncertain to tease him with my answer. I wanted to go for a walk and I wanted very much to go for a walk with <i>him.</i> If I had a hope that wha...</p><h2>The Fender Telecaster (Reference)</h2><p>The Fender Telecaster is regarded as the first commercially successful solid body electric &#39;Spanish&#39; guitar.

Dr. Taylor is a distinguished medical researcher, offshore sailor, model-boat builder, and father of two grown children. He is the author of the beloved Irish Country novels, beginning with <i>An Irish Country Doctor, </i>as well as <i>Pray For Us </i>Sinners and its sequel, <i>Now and in the Hour of Our Death, </i>a duology centered around The Troubles. He now lives on Saltspring Island, British Columbia.</p>1 <br> <br> <i>I&#x2019;ll Give You Leave to Call Me Anything</i> <br> <br>"Our first breakfast together as man and wife in our own home," said Doctor Fingal Flahertie O&#x2019;Reilly, beaming at the suntanned woman across the table. "And how does it feel to be back in Number One Main Street, Mrs. O&#x2019;Reilly?" Three honeymoon weeks in Rhodes had given them both healthy glows and brightened the silver streaks in the raven hair of Caitlin "Kitty" O&#x2019;Reilly n�e O&#x2019;Hallorhan. <br> <br>"It feels very good to be home, Fingal, and in what&#x2019;s now my home, too," she said, stretching out a hand and covering his. <br> <br>"And it does be good to have you both back, so." Mrs. Maureen "Kinky" Kincaid came in bringing a tray with two plates, each bearing a full Irish breakfast. She set one in front of Kitty. "Now eat up however little much is in it, Miss&#x2014;" She frowned. <br> <br>Oh-oh, Fingal thought, Kinky&#x2019;s having difficulty working out the proper form of address between the housekeeper and the mistress of the house. "Miss Kitty" had been fine before the wedding. "Mrs. O&#x2019;Reilly" would be too formal. "Mrs. Kitty" sounded odd. He waited, a tiny smile playing on his lips. <br> <br>"Kinky," Kitty said, "plain Kitty&#x2019;s fine. Aren&#x2019;t we friends?" <br> <br>"We are, so." Kinky&#x2019;s two chins wobbled as she chuckled and said, "Indeed we are so, Kitty, bye. And there&#x2019;s your breakfast, sir. I&#x2019;ve done the rashers crisp, the way you like them." <br> <br>The telephone in the hall began its double-ringing clamour. "I&#x2019;ll see who that is," she said. <br> <br>"That was gracious, Kitty," O&#x2019;Reilly said, feeling his mouth water, "and it&#x2019;s a great relief to me that you and Kinky are getting on so well now." He stabbed a ring of black pudding, sliced it, and shoved half into his mouth. Greek grub had been all right, but it was great to get back to Kinky&#x2019;s proper Irish cooking. He was, as she often remarked, "a grand man for the pan." <br> <br>"We&#x2019;d better," Kitty said, and smiled. "It&#x2019;ll be a whole new experience for you, having three women in the house and no fun at all if two of them are at loggerheads." <br> <br>"True enough." Young Barry Laverty, who had been O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s assistant until recently, had gone to Ballymena for training in obstetrics and gynaecology. His place as temporary assistant had been taken by one Doctor Jennifer Bradley, who was out on a maternity case this Saturday morning. "At least," he said, "having Jenny living and working here lets me have some weekends off. After breakfast, let&#x2019;s pop in and see Donal and Julie Donnelly and the new chissler. Kinky tells me the wee lass arrived three days after we left, so her birthday&#x2019;s July 6." <br> <br>"I&#x2019;ll put that in my diary when we&#x2019;ve finished breakfast&#x2014;" <br> <br>"Sir." Kinky stood in the doorway. The colour had left her cheeks. "It&#x2019;s the marquis. His sister, Lady MacNeill, has had a riding accident." <br> <br>Fingal ran to the phone, bolting the black pudding as he did. Young ones being born, middle-aged ones falling off their bloody horses. The daily round of the country G.P., a job he&#x2019;d loved for more than twenty years. And he was duty bound to answer this call even if it was his weekend off. He grabbed the receiver. "John? What&#x2019;s up?" <br> <br>He listened as John MacNeill, marquis of Ballybucklebo, explained how his sister had been thrown when her gelding, Bramble, balked at a jump. "You reckon her leg&#x2019;s bust? I see. Is she conscious? Good. No trouble breathing? Good. John, don&#x2019;t try to move her. Keep her warm, don&#x2019;t give her anything to eat or drink, and I&#x2019;ll be right out." He slammed the receiver into its cradle. "Kinky, get an ambulance out to Ballybucklebo House." He stuck his head into the dining room. "Kitty, the marquis&#x2019;s sister has been hurt. I&#x2019;m heading straight out there. Shouldn&#x2019;t be too long." <br> <br>"I&#x2019;m coming&#x2014;" Kitty started to rise. <br> <br>"Finish your breakfast." There was no time to waste on politeness or explanations. He had to get out there now, and even if she was a nurse, there was nothing Kitty could do. As he crossed the hall, O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s stomach grumbled. Couldn&#x2019;t be helped, but Lord, that soup�on of black pudding had been delicious. He grabbed his bag from the surgery and charged down the hall. Lady Macbeth, his white cat, leapt for the stairs, scrabbled between the bars of the banister, arched her back, fluffed her tail, and spat. <br> <br>He raced through the back garden yelling, "Stay, Arthur," when the big black Labrador stuck his muzzle out of his kennel. <br> <br>In moments O&#x2019;Reilly was in the long-nosed Rover, roaring along the main Belfast to Bangor Road. He barely noticed a cyclist taking refuge in the ditch. Up the gravelled drive, past the oddly shaped topiary in front of Ballybucklebo House, round its Virginia-creeper-covered gable end. The gate was open to an adjoining paddock, where he saw a saddled bay horse, reins dangling, cropping the grass. Two men squatted beside a figure lying near a two-bar jump. <br> <br>The old Rover jounced across the field, shuddered to a halt, and O&#x2019;Reilly, bag in hand, dismounted close to the marquis and his butler/valet Thompson. Both were coatless, their jackets covering the prone Myrna even though the sun was splitting the heavens. Fingal felt its early-morning heat and heard the burbling of wood pigeons from a nearby coppice and the <i>Kek-kek-kek</i> of a cock pheasant. <br> <br>"Fingal," John O&#x2019;Neill said. "Thank you so much for coming so quickly. Thompson and I have done as you told us." <br> <br>"Good." He knelt. "Myrna, please don&#x2019;t turn your head, but can you hear me?" <br> <br>Until he was satisfied that she hadn&#x2019;t hurt her spine it was critical that Myrna not move. <br> <br>"I can hear you perfectly clearly, Fingal, thank you." <br> <br>"Where are you sore?" <br> <br>"I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;ll have a bruise like a soup plate on my backside, but it&#x2019;s my right thigh. I distinctly heard the bone snap. It&#x2019;s aching now to beat Bannagher and I can feel the muscles all knotted up." He was impressed by how calm she sounded describing what was, almost certainly, the muscle spasms associated with fractures of the femoral shaft. "And no, I didn&#x2019;t land on my head." He noticed that her John Bull top hat was still firmly in place. "I was getting ready for next week&#x2019;s gymkhana. Bloody horse has never refused before and I should be putting him at the jump again, but clearly I&#x2019;m not fit to do that." <br> <br>"Lie still, Myrna," O&#x2019;Reilly said. <br> <br>"I wonder, Thompson, if you&#x2019;d be good enough to catch Bramble?" said the marquis. "Take him back to the stables." He spoke to his sister. "I don&#x2019;t want you fretting about your horse. Don&#x2019;t worry, Myrna. I&#x2019;ll get him over that damned jump once I know you&#x2019;re settled." <br> <br>"Thank you, John." <br> <br>O&#x2019;Reilly ran through the routine assessment of a patient who had fallen. When he examined her lower limbs, he had already satisfied himself that she had suffered no head or spinal cord injury at least as far down as the first lumbar vertebra, and if she was feeling pain in her thigh and could sense the spasms, it was probable that the second and third were unaffected too. The fuller neurological assessment could wait until she was in the hands of the orthopaedic specialists at the Musgrave and Clark Clinic, the private hospital associated with the Royal Victoria Hospital. Right now, he had no concerns about moving Myrna once her leg had been splinted. <br> <br>O&#x2019;Reilly glanced at his watch. "I&#x2019;ve sent for an ambulance," he said. "Should be at the hall soon. Could you meet them, John? Bring them round here." <br> <br>"Of course." The marquis left. <br> <br>"I need to have a look at the leg, Myrna," O&#x2019;Reilly said, not relishing what he had to do. <br> <br>"Go ahead, Doctor." She smiled, then winced. <br> <br>O&#x2019;Reilly looked at her right riding boot. The toes were pointing to the side at an unnatural angle and the whole leg seemed to be about an inch shorter than the left. He took a deep breath and gently laid both hands on her jodhpurs at the top of her right thigh. When he approached mid-thigh he heard Myrna sucking in her breath. "Sorry," he said. <br> <br>"That bloody well hurt." He saw how pale she was and a drop of blood where she had bitten her lip. <br> <br>O&#x2019;Reilly was certain Myrna had fractured the shaft of her right femur. "Your diagnosis is correct, I&#x2019;m afraid," he said. "It is broken. We&#x2019;ll have to get you to the Clinic and have it set. In fact, I think I hear the ambulance arriving now. I&#x2019;ll give you something for the pain." <br> <br>The ambulance driver and attendant were efficient, waited patiently until the quarter grain of morphine he had given her took effect before they applied a Thomas traction splint to immobilise the break, realign the ends of the broken bone, and reduce muscle spasm and further soft tissue injury. Introduced by the Welsh surgeon Hugh Owen Thomas in 1916, this type of splint had reduced the mortality rate for femoral shaft fractures from 80 to 8 percent. <br> <br>The ambulance driver tied a label to her hacking jacket collar. The red "M" indicated she&#x2019;d been given morphine. <br> <br>She said drowsily, "Thank you, Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly," as they loaded her into the primrose yellow Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority ambulance. It drove off, slowly at first, across the irregular ground in the field. The injury, now the splint had been applied, was hardly life-threatening, so there were no accompanying flashing lights or screaming sirens. <br> <br>"She&#x2019;ll be grand, John," O&#x2019;Reilly said to the marquis. "As good as new. Broken bones are pretty routine stuff today." Not, he thought, like in my student and junior doctor days. Fingal decided not to worry the marquis by talking about potential complications like nonunion of the bones or deep venous thrombosis in an immobilised limb. <br> <br>"I appreciate your coming out, Fingal, and your reassurance," the marquis said, "and I&#x2019;m sure she will be fine. Myrna&#x2019;s a tough old bird." He nodded toward the house. "I suppose it&#x2019;s a bit early for a Jameson, but if you&#x2019;d like a cuppa?" <br> <br>"Much too early for whiskey," said Fingal, "and as I hadn&#x2019;t even finished my breakfast. I&#x2019;ll be trotting on, thank you, John." He opened the car&#x2019;s door and chucked his bag inside. <br> <br>"Understood," said the marquis, stooping to retrieve his and Thompson&#x2019;s coats, "but now you&#x2019;re home from abroad you and Mrs. O&#x2019;Reilly must come round soon. Have a bite." <br> <br>"We&#x2019;d like that," O&#x2019;Reilly said, thinking how much he liked the "we," "but it&#x2019;s home James, and don&#x2019;t spare the horses for me now." <br> <br>On the drive back to Number One, O&#x2019;Reilly let his thoughts roam. He&#x2019;d phone and arrange for Myrna MacNeill to be looked after by Sir Donald Cromie, one of O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s classmates and close friends from their student days in Dublin. Cromie&#x2019;d studied under Mister Jimmy Withers, the first orthopaedic surgeon in Northern Ireland. Fingal&#x2019;s other great friend, Charlie Greer, was now a consultant neurosurgeon at the Royal Victoria. <br> <br>It had been an interesting road Fingal O&#x2019;Reilly had travelled to get here; G.P. in Dublin, junior doctor in the Rotunda Maternity Hospital there, then assistant to Doctor Flanagan here in Ballybucklebo before the war. He&#x2019;d been briefly married when he was a naval surgeon on a British battleship, and then after the war the widowed principal in his present practice. He frowned. The first years here had been lonely ones without her, but Fingal was single no more and he knew his first wife Deirdre would fully approve of Kitty, and that thought drove away his frown and brought a smile to the dark eyes he&#x2019;d inherited from his father. <br> <br>He could recall in detail his interview for that very first job, and his first-ever case as a newly qualified doctor. That had been a patient with a fracture too, but unlike today, in 1936 the outlook was not as good. <br> <br>It took no effort to see himself twenty-seven, one week qualified, standing in Aungier Place in Dublin&#x2019;s Liberties slums ready to go into the building that housed the dispensary practice presided over by one Doctor Phelim Corrigan. <br> <br>Copyright � 2013 by Ballybucklebo Stories Corp <br> <p></p></p><h2>The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven</h2><p>In this darkly comic short story collection, Sherman Alexie, a Spokane/Coeur d&#39;Alene Indian, brilliantly weaves memory, fantasy, and stark realism to paint a complex, grimly ironic portrait of life in and around the Spokane Indian Reservation. These twenty-two interlinked tales are narrated by characters raised on humiliation and government-issue cheese, and yet are filled with passion and affection, myth and dream. There is Victor, who as a nine-year-old crawled between his unconscious parents hoping that the alcohol seeping through their skins might help him sleep, Thomas Builds-the-Fire, who tells his stories long after people stop listening, and Jimmy Many Horses, dying of cancer, who writes letters on stationary that reads &#34;From the Death Bed of Jimmy Many Horses III,&#34; even though he actually writes then on his kitchen table. Against a backdrop of alcohol, car accidents, laughter, and basketball, Alexie depicts the distances between Indians and whites, reservation Indians and urban Indians, men and women, and mostly poetically between modern Indians and the traditions of the past.</p><p>Sherman Alexie is the author of the novels <i>Reservation Blues</i> and <i>Indian Killer</i> and three collections of poetry. He also wrotethe screeplay for the movie <i>Smoke Signals.</i> He lives in Seattle, Washington.With wrenching pain and wry humor, the talented Alexie, a Spokane/Coeur d'Alene Indian--and previously a small-press author (The Business of Fancydancing, a collection of poetry and prose-- not reviewed--etc.)--presents contemporary life on the Spokane Indian Reservation through 22 linked stories. Here, people treat each other (and life) with amused tolerance--although anger can easily erupt in this environment of endemic alcoholism and despair. The history of defeat is ever- present; every attempt to hold onto cultural tradition aches with poignancy: Thomas-Builds-the-Fire is the storyteller everyone mocks and no one listens to; Aunt Nezzy, who sews a traditional full- length beaded dress that turns out to be too heavy to wear, believes that the woman ``who can carry the weight of this dress on her back...will save us all.'' Meanwhile, young men dream of escape--going to college, being a basketball star--but failure seems preordained. These tales, though sad and at times plain- spokenly didactic, are often lyrically beautiful and almost always very funny. Chapters focus on and are narrated by several different characters, but voices and perspectives often become somewhat indistinguishable--confusing until you stop worrying about who is speaking and choose to listen to the voice of the book itself and enter into its particular sensibility. Irony, grim humor, and forgiveness help characters transcend pain, anger and loss while the same qualities make it possible to read Alexie's fiction without succumbing to hopelessness. Forgiveness seems to be the last moral/ethical value left standing: the ability both to judge and to love gives the book its searing yet affectionate honesty.

One night her solitude is disrupted by a visitor&#x2014;a speechless, mercurial boy named Simon, who tries to steal from her and then repays her with his most precious possession. As Kerewin succumbs to Simon's feral charm, she also falls under the spell of his Maori foster father Joe, who rescued the boy from a shipwreck and now treats him with an unsettling mixture of tenderness and brutality. Out of this unorthodox trinity Keri Hulme has created what is at once a mystery, a love story, and an ambitious exploration of the zone where Maori and European New Zealand meet, clash, and sometimes merge. <p> Winner of both a Booker Prize and Pegasus Prize for Literature, <b>The Bone People</b> is a work of unfettered wordplay and mesmerizing emotional complexity.</p></p><p><p>Keri Hulme is of Maori, Scottish, and English ancestry and grew up in Christchurch and Moeraki, New Zealand. She has worked as a fish-'n'-chip cook, tobacco picker, woolen mill winder, census taker, journalist, postmistress, and television director. In 1983 she became a full-time writer. Through a government lottery, she won a plot of land on a remote Westland coast, where she erected an octagonal-shaped dwelling and settled in. She writes, paints, and fishes and has published seven books.</p>This is quite a first novel. The ending is revealed at its mysterious beginning; exotic line breaks and poetic punctuation put off at first but gradually become the best way to tell the tale; the Maori vocabulary is interwoven with contemporary British, Australian, and American idioms; and the New Zealand sea- and landscape vibrate under fresh perception. Hulme shifts narrative points of view to build a gripping account of violence, love, death, magic, and redemption. A silverhaired, mute, abused orphan, a laborer heavy with sustained loss, and a brilliant intro spective recluse discover, after enormous struggle through injury and illness, what it means to lose and then regain a family. No wonder The Bone People won the Pegasus Prize. Highly recommended.

A grenade explosion in Vietnam had left him a triple amputee. He had lost his seat in the U.S. Senate, and in the grip of depression he had lost his fianc�e, too. But instead of giving up, Cleland reaches deep into his soul and discovers that he has what it takes to survive: the heart of a patriot. <br> <br> Born and raised in Georgia, Max comes back from Vietnam missing three limbs and is confined for months at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Doctors don't give him much hope of living an active life, but through the bonds he forms with other wounded soldiers, and through his own Southern grit, he learns how to be mobile and overcome his despair. He returns home, where he pursues his passion for public service by becoming the first Vietnam veteran to serve in the Georgia state senate. Jimmy Carter then appoints him head of the Veterans Administration. From there he becomes Georgia's youngest secretary of state and ultimately realizes his dream of becoming a U.S. Senator. <br> <br> But during his reelection campaign he is singled out by Republicans, who smear him as "unpatriotic." He loses his seat and begins another steep tumble. A long-dormant case of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, awakened after 9/11 by the invasion of Iraq, pushes Max to the brink. Forty years after Vietnam, having reached -- and fallen from -- a pinnacle of power, Max returns to Walter Reed as a patient, surrounded by veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. Among them, Max again finds the faith and endurance to regain control of his life. <br> <br> In a memoir free of bitterness but frank about the costs of being a soldier, Max Cleland describes with love the ties America's soldiers forge with one another, along with the disillusionment many of them experience when they come home. He spares no one his humiliations and setbacks in this gut-wrenching account of his life in the hope it will keep even one veteran from descending into darkness. <i>Heart of a Patriot</i> is a story about the joy of serving the country you love, no matter the cost -- and how to recover from the deepest wounds of war.</p><p><b>Max Cleland </b>is a Vietnam War veteran and former U.S. Senator from Georgia who has served as the head of the Veterans Administration and on the 9/11 Commission.

Because of that, America's military is always staffed with the stoutest, finest, most courageous people in the country. If as soldiers we are not that way when we enter the military, the military makes us that way by the time we get out. In the end, the military is still made up of everyday people like you and me. As such, most of us have no special skills to cope with the challenges wartime military service presents. Regular life simply cannot prepare a person for the brutish sensory overload of combat. </p><p> Coming back from military service in a time of war, we may be wounded in ways that don't show to the world at large. Some of the deepest wounds we suffer may be inflicted without leaving so much as a scratch. No matter what you are feeling when you come home, no matter how crazy you feel inside, know that you are not mentally ill. As combat veterans, we have been through some of the most traumatic life experiences possible. War is as close to hell on earth as anything ever could be. That does make us different from our loved ones back home. War marks us all, some more deeply than others. </p><p> As veterans, we have paid a price to serve our country. We have suffered. And we may suffer for a lifetime. The soldier never gets to choose his or her war. The wars choose us, and not all are just. I believe the emotional casualties of the misguided wars may be the hardest of all to bear. </p><p> The soldier's lot is to be exposed to traumatic, life-threatening events -- happenings that take us to places no bodies, minds, or souls should ever visit. It is a journey to the dark places of life -- terror, fear, pain, death, wounding, loss, grief, despair, and hopelessness. We have been traumatized physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. Some of us cope with exposure to hell better than others. Some are able to think of their combat experiences as but unpleasant vignettes in a long and wonderful life. It is not to those veterans I am speaking. I love them, but I am not afraid for them. </p><p> I am speaking to the rest of my brothers and sisters, those who find themselves trapped in the misery of memories as I was for so long. </p><p> For them, I am afraid. </p><p> To those veterans I say, you are not alone. </p><p> Many of us have been overwhelmed by war. Many of us have been unable to cope on our own with what has happened to us or with what we have done. Many of us have been left hopeless, lost, and confused about ourselves and our lives in ways we never thought possible. </p><p> That does not make us victims. </p><p> It makes us veterans. </p><p> As veterans of war, we are vulnerable to the memories of those experiences for the rest of our lives. Movies, the nightly news, the death of a loved one, even simple stress can serve as a trigger that reminds us of the hell we were once in. Just that remembrance can sometimes be enough to undo all the buckles we used to put ourselves back together when we got home. </p><p> Our bodies, minds, and spirits react automatically to these memory triggers. They feel the hurts and fear and horror anew each time. The curse of the soldier is that he never forgets. </p><p> Having once felt mortal danger and pure terror, our bodies prepare for it again. That helped us survive on the battlefield. However, what saved us on the battlefield doesn't work very well back here at home. It is impossible to forget our experiences in the military. But it is possible to deal with them positively. It is possible to take control of them. </p><p> That's what I've had to do. </p><p> I've found in my own life that I had to exude positive energy into the world in order not to be overwhelmed with sadness and grief over what I have lost. My body, my soul, my spirit, and my belief in life itself were stolen from me by the disaster of the Vietnam War. I found solace in attempting to "turn my pain into somebody else's gain" by immersing myself in politics and public service. In particular, I devoted myself to helping my fellow veterans and disabled friends heal. This was a great help to me in my life. But when I lost my reelection bid for the U.S. Senate in 2002, my life fell apart. The staff that had helped me politically and physically so I could keep on running with no legs was gone. The pleasure of having a job worth doing and the money to keep me afloat were gone. </p><p> My relationships began to crumble, especially the one with my fianc�e. </p><p> I went down in my life in every way it is possible to go down. Massive depression took over. I went down with a grief over my losses that I had never known before. I went down thinking that God was not for me anymore. I no longer wanted to live. With the start of the Iraq War, my own post-traumatic stress disorder came roaring back nearly 40 years after I was in combat. I never saw it coming. Thoughts of war and death simply consumed me. I thought I was past that. </p><p> It taught me that none of us are ever past it. But all of us can get past it enough to be happy. </p><p> When I went down, my sense of safety, organization, structure, and stability collapsed. My anxiety went sky-high. My brain chemicals, which had helped me stay hopeful and optimistic, dropped through the floor. My brain stopped working. My mind, which I had counted on all my life to pull me through and help clarify challenges, fell into despair. My spirit dropped like a rock as all hope I had for a good life went away. I was totally wounded and wiped out -- hopeless and overwhelmed. Just like I had been on that April day in 1968 when the grenade ripped off my legs and my right arm. Emotionally, spiritually, physically, and mentally, I was bleeding and dying. I wound up at Walter Reed Army Medical Center almost 40 years after I had been treated there the first time. This time around, I was in search of being put back together again in my mind, heart, and soul. When I was there the first time, the doctors didn't really treat our hearts and minds, just our broken bodies. Post-traumatic stress disorder didn't officially exist. Neither did counseling for it. What a world of difference several decades make! </p><p> Recovery is possible. There are people who can help. </p><p> Through weekly counseling, medication for anxiety and depression, and weekly attendance at a spiritual Twelve Step recovery group, I began to heal. My personal recovery and renewal have taken years. I still talk to my PTSD counselor at Walter Reed occasionally when I need to do so. I still take a low dose of antianxiety and antidepression medication. I still stay in touch with my brothers in my Tuesday night Twelve Step group at the "last house on the block." As a brother in that group, I lean on my fellow attendees, especially my fellow veterans, and feed off their experience, strength, and hope. </p><p> Which is why I am writing this open letter especially to those who have suffered what Shakespeare referred to as "the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune" by getting blown up, shot up, or otherwise wounded in the service of our country. For me, the physical wounds were the first to heal and the easiest to deal with. It is not easy to run for political office or try to run forward in life with no legs. But I've been able to do it. The mental and emotional wounds -- and a whole suite of spiritual wounds -- have been far more difficult to overcome. They are the most subtle of all, and the hardest to heal. From time to time, I am overwhelmed by the sense of meaninglessness I feel regarding the Vietnam War, in which I was a young participant, and the Iraq War Resolution, which I voted for as a U.S. senator. To keep my sanity, I must not dwell on my part in those disastrous episodes in American history. I try not to blame myself too much. I work on my own recovery and renewal knowing that I can't help anyone else unless I get, as Hemingway put it after his war, "strong at the broken places." </p><p> I try to get enough sleep so my mind can regenerate. I exercise. I still walk with no legs, putting my stumps on pillows and sliding across the floor to get my aerobic workouts. Occasionally I do sit-ups and push-ups and curls with weights. I stay in touch with the members of my group and read literature like the Bible, which guides my prayer and meditation and helps me remember that God is with me, not against me. I work on my physical, spiritual, and mental recovery and renewal every day. </p><p> Recovery is possible from even the most grievous wounds of war, politics, and life. But we veterans remain painfully aware of our experiences. As my trauma counselor tells me, it is fine to look in the rearview mirror from time to time to see where you've been, but it is much more important to look through the windshield to see where you want to go. We can't let where we've been dominate and control where we are headed. Otherwise, we live an upside-down life. </p><p> In addition to trying to muster the courage and the faith to move forward each day, I try to remember that I am blessed to have the grace of God and the help of friends to point the way and help me along my path. </p><p> I wish you the same. </p><p> <i>Max Cleland<br> Atlanta, Georgia<br> 2009</i> Copyright � 2009 by Max Cleland</p></p><h2>The Beauty: Poems</h2><p><p><i>The Beauty,</i> an incandescent new collection from one of&nbsp; American poetry&#x2019;s most distinctive and essential voices, opens with a series of dappled, ranging &#x201c;My&#x201d; poems&#x2014;&#x201c;My Skeleton,&#x201d; &#x201c;My Corkboard,&#x201d; &#x201c;My Species,&#x201d; &#x201c;My Weather&#x201d;&#x2014;using materials sometimes familiar, sometimes unexpected, to explore the magnitude, singularity, and permeability of our shared existence.

We&#x2019;d kept ours for years and years, ever since we came to live at Piscul Dracului and stumbled on the way into the Other Kingdom. Nobody knew about it&#x2014;not Father, not our housekeeper, Florica, or her husband, Petru, not Uncle Nicolae or Aunt Bogdana or their son, Cezar. We found the portal when Tati was seven and I was six, and we&#x2019;d been going out and coming in nearly every month since then: nine whole years of Full Moons. We had plenty of ways to cover our absences, including a bolt on our bedchamber door and the excuse that my sister Paula sometimes walked in her sleep.<br><br>I suppose the secret was not completely ours; Gogu knew.

Ever since I&#x2019;d found him long ago, crouched all by himself in the forest, dazed and hurt, I had known I could trust him more than anyone else in the world.<br><br>It was the day of Full Moon. In the bedchamber our gowns and shoes were laid out ready; combs, bags, and hair ornaments were set beside them. Nothing would be touched now, until the household was safely in bed. Fortunately, it was rare for Florica to come up to our room, because it was at the top of a flight of stairs, and stairs made her knees hurt. I did wonder how much Florica knew or guessed. She must have noticed how quiet we always were on the night of Full Moon, and how exhausted we were when we stumbled down to breakfast the next morning. But if she knew, Florica didn&#x2019;t say a thing.<br><br>During the day we kept up our normal activities, trying not to arouse suspicion. Paula helped Florica cook fish ciorb?a, while Iulia went out to lend a hand to Petru, who was storing away sacks of grain to last us over the winter. Iulia did not enjoy the hard work of the farm, but at least, she said, it made the time go more quickly. Tati was teaching Stela to read: I had seen the two of them ensconced in a warm corner of the kitchen, making letters in a tray of wet sand.<br><br>I sat in the workroom with Father, reconciling a set of orders with a record of payments. I was good with figures and helped him regularly with such tasks. The merchant business in which he was a partner with his cousin, whom we called Uncle Nicolae, kept the two of them much occupied. Gogu sat on the desk, keeping himself to himself, though once or twice I caught his silent voice&#x2014;the one only I could hear.<br><br>You&#x2019;re upset, Jena.<br><br>&#x201c;Mmm,&#x201d; I murmured, not wanting to get into a real conversation with him while both Father and his secretary, Gabriel, were in the room. My family didn&#x2019;t truly believe that I sometimes knew what Gogu was thinking. Even my sisters, who had long ago accepted that this was no ordinary frog, thought that I was deluding myself&#x2014;putting my own words into the frog&#x2019;s mouth, perhaps. I knew that was wrong. I&#x2019;d had Gogu since I was a small girl, and the things he told me definitely didn&#x2019;t come from my own head.<br><br>Don&#x2019;t be sad. Tonight is Full Moon.<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t help it, Gogu. I&#x2019;m worried. Now hush, or Father will hear me.&#x201d;<br><br>Father was trying to write a letter. He kept coughing, and in between bouts he struggled to catch his breath. Tomorrow he would be leaving on a journey to the port of Constan�ta, in the milder climate of the Black Sea coast. His doctor had told him, sternly, that if he tried to get through another winter at Piscul Dracului in his present ill health, he would be dead before the first buds opened on the oaks. We five sisters would be looking after the place on our own, right through the winter. Of course, Uncle Nicolae would help with the business, and Florica and Petru with the house and farm. It was not so much the extra responsibility that troubled me. Father was away often enough on business and we had coped before, though not for so long. What chilled me was the thought that when we said goodbye in the morning, it might be forever.<br><br>At supper we were all quiet. I was thinking about what Father had confided to Tati and me earlier. Up till then, none of us had mentioned the possibility that Father might die of this illness, for to say that aloud would be to put the unthinkable into words. But Father had wanted his eldest daughters to be prepared for whatever might happen. Should he die before any of us girls married and bore a son, he&#x2019;d explained, both Piscul Dracului and Father&#x2019;s share of the business would go to Uncle Nicolae, as the closest male relative. We were not to worry. If the worst should occur, Uncle Nicolae would see we were provided for.<br><br>Uncle Nicolae&#x2019;s family home was called V�rful cu Negur?a: Storm Heights. His house was quite grand, set on a hillside and surrounded by birch and pine forest. He ran a prosperous farm and a timber business, as well as the trading ventures that had made him wealthy. When we were little, we had lived in the merchant town of Bra�sov, and V�rful cu Negur?a had been a place we visited as a special treat. It was hard to say what I had loved best about it: the dark forest, the forbidden lake, or the excitement of playing with our big cousins, who were both boys.<br><br>But there was no doubt at all what Father had loved. Next door to V�rful cu Negur?a was Piscul Dracului, Devil&#x2019;s Peak. Father had first seen the empty, crumbling castle, set on a high spur of rock, when he was only a boy. Our father was an unusual kind of person, and as soon as he clapped eyes on Piscul Dracului he wanted to live there. There&#x2019;d been nobody to inherit the ruin and the tract of wildwood that went with it; perhaps the many strange tales attached to the place had frightened people away. The owner had died long ago. Florica and Petru had been custodians of the place for years, looking after the empty chambers and eking out a living from the small farm, for they were hardworking, thrifty folk.<br><br>Father had waited a long time to achieve his dream. He had worked hard, married, and fathered daughters, bought and sold, scrimped and saved. When he&#x2019;d set enough silver aside from his merchant ventures, trading in silk carpets and bear skins, spices and fine porcelain, he&#x2019;d quietly paid a large sum to an influential voivode, gone into partnership with Uncle Nicolae, and moved our family into Piscul Dracului.<br><br>I think Mother would have preferred to stay in Bra�sov, for she feared the tales folk told about the old castle. It looked as if it had grown up out of the forest, with an assortment of bits and pieces sprouting from every corner: tiny turrets, long covered walkways, squat round towers, arches, and flagpoles. The eccentric nobleman who had built it had probably been someone just like Father. People seldom ventured into the forest around Piscul Dracului. There was a lake deep within the wildwood, a place unofficially known as the Deadwash, though its real name was prettier: T?aul Ielelor, Lake of the Nymphs. Every family had a dark story about the Deadwash. We got ours soon after we moved into the castle. When I was five years old, my cousin Costi&#x2014;Uncle Nicolae&#x2019;s eldest son&#x2014;drowned in T?aul Ielelor. I was there when it happened. The things folk said about the lake were true.<br><br>Before Father became so ill, Tati and I had scarcely given a thought to such weighty matters as what might happen to Piscul Dracului, with no son to inherit our father&#x2019;s property. My elder sister was a dreamer, and I had a different kind of future in mind for myself: one in which I would work alongside my father, traveling and trading and seeing the world. Marriage and children were secondary in my scheme of things. Now&#x2014;with Father&#x2019;s cough ringing in our ears, and his white face regarding us across the supper table&#x2014;they had become a frightening reality. I remembered Aunt Bogdana saying that sixteen was the ideal age for a young woman to wed. Tati was already in her seventeenth year; I was only one year younger.<br><br>Father went off to bed as soon as the meal was over; he&#x2019;d hardly touched his food. The others disappeared to our bedchamber, but I waited for Florica to bank up the fire in the big stove and for Petru to bolt the front door, and for the two of them to retire to their sleeping quarters. Then it was safe, and I ran up the stairs to our chamber, my worries set aside for now, my heart beating fast with an anticipation that was part joy, part fear. At last it was time.<br><br>The long room we sisters shared had four round windows of colored glass: soft violet, blood-red, midnight-blue, beech-green. Beyond them the full moon was sailing up into the night sky. I put Gogu on a shelf to watch as I took off my working dress and put on my dancing gown, a green one that my frog was particularly fond of. Paula was calmly lighting our small lanterns, to be ready for the journey.<br><br>With five girls, even the biggest bedchamber can get crowded. As Tati fastened the hooks on my gown, I watched Iulia twirling in front of the mirror. She was thirteen now, and developing the kind of curvaceous figure our Mother had had. Her gown was of cobalt silk and she had swept her dark curls up into a circlet of ribbon butterflies. We had become clever, over the years, in our use of the leftovers from Father&#x2019;s shipments. He was good at what he did, but buying Piscul Dracului had eaten up a lot of his funds and, even in partnership with his wealthy cousin, he was still making up for lost ground. I saw the books every day&#x2014;he had been unable to conceal from me that finances remained very tight. We sisters had to improvise. We made one new dancing gown anytime a cargo contained a little more of a certain fabric than the buyer had requested. I wore Tati&#x2019;s hand-me-downs; Paula wore mine. Iulia, with her fuller figure, did rather better, because she could not fit into either Tati&#x2019;s clothes or mine. All the same, she complained; she would have liked a whole wardrobe of finery. Tati was clever with her need...</p><h2>A Stitch in Time (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine #27)</h2><p>Garak tells all to Doctor Bashir, revealing a colorful and treacherous past, his days in the Obsidian order, and the reason for his banishment to Deep Space Nine. Original.</p><p><b>Chapter 1</b> <p> To: Dr. Julian Bashir<br> Chief Medical Officer<br> Deep Space 9<br> </p><p> Entry:<br> How odd you humans are. Or is it just the Starfleet people? Captain Sisko has just invited me to join the invasion -- for which I am eternally grateful. The opportunity to liberate my homeland renews and animates my sluggish spirit. But the good captain makes no mention of the fact that this invasion is now possible because of the incident with the Romulans. I am simply to report to his office at "oh-nine hundred hours" with ideas as to where the Dominion defense perimeter might be vulnerable. Oh, our dealings with each other are nothing less than proper ("Mr. Garak," "Captain Sisko"), but what's so odd is that he pretends the incident never happened. And you and I both know how deeply affected he was by the whole business. Only when we exchange direct looks do I perceive a flicker of...what? Anger? Betrayal? Violation? </p><p> Odd people. </p><p> Humans seem to walk through life's infinite variety of relationships and situations taking them all at face value. They rarely look behind the facade or the mask, where real intentions -- the truth of our motives -- live. And the fact is, more often than not they deny that they have any mask at all. These humans (and I do exclude you, Doctor -- I will come to that shortly) believe that what they present to the world and, conversely, what the world presents to them, is the truth. It's this belief that makes them dangerous. </p><p> In Cardassian society, we are taught from an early age to mask all feelings and thoughts, to deflect all outside perception and observation. The objective of this education is to create a citizen who can work within the group to accomplish a group goal established by the leader, and at the same time work in such a way that none of the other members of the group knows what he or she is doing. As long as the goal is accomplished, it's nobody's business how you went about your work. </p><p> So why Captain Sisko is so upset with me because I accomplished the goal (which he established!) of getting Romulus into the war against the Dominion baffles me. And it's not because of the few lives that were sacrificed. Federation expansion has taken a toll in countless life-forms -- about most of which they are blissfully unaware. The moment you step into a garden and begin to cultivate and prune, you become a killer. Perhaps the captain was upset because he had hesitated to do what was necessary to insure the integrity of his garden. Sentimentality is another trait that makes humans dangerous. </p><p> But why am I writing this to you, instead of waxing philosophical over one of our lunches? I see that overly polite smile, your "Get to the point, Garak" mask. Patience, dear Doctor. First, let me explain why I can exempt you from this human bondage to appearance and sentiment. Long before it was revealed that you were genetically "enhanced," I recognized in you an intelligence, a capacity for understanding that I found lacking in other humans. As much as the subject irritates you, you have not been so much genetically enhanced as "arranged." The people who did this to you had specific reasons, which you have long since outgrown. And having assimilated these changes you've accommodated yourself to this "arrangement" according to the demands of your life. For me, this means that in a sense you are more Cardassian than human. Which is why I am able to share this document with you...and why I sat down to lunch with you in the first place. </p><p> Before you cringe with horror at the thought of being a Cardassian, let me give you an example. Human memory is selective and linear. Simply put, a human remembers the best of times in progressive order, beginning with earliest childhood. The rosy memories are only challenged by nightmares. A Cardassian remembers everything on every level all the time. For us, past and present are not neatly separated. We live with everything in the moment -- including the nightmares. And so do you. To a human this would be chaotic, unbearable. For us it's just the way it is. </p><p> This is one reason why I am addressing this recollection to you. Fate lines are converging, like memories to a dying man. I need to write this, Doctor, and you're the only person on this station who will understand. The invasion of Cardassia is momentous. Many will die. If I don't survive, I want you to deliver copies of this to some people I will name at the end. </p><p> There's another reason. I know that we have grown apart and that's as it should be. We learn what we can from certain people, then we move on after we've taken what we need. When we learn nothing new about ourselves in a relationship that's when the relationship is over. Or it's over the moment when we're afraid to learn something new about ourselves. But what I have been learning about myself...whatever it was inside me that was sparked and challenged when I first met you...is deeply connected to this story. I'm an unfinished man, Doctor, like a suit of clothes hanging on a display rack waiting for the final touches that may never come; I need to tell this story to make a peace with those parts of me that were left unfinished. A healing. Indulge me, if you will; I need you as a witness. A stitch in time.... </p><p> Copyright � 2000 by Paramount Pictures</p></p><h2>Jane Austen</h2><p><p>Devoted fans and scholars of Jane Austen&#x2015;as well as skeptics&#x2015;will rejoice at Tony Tanner&#x2019;s superb book on the incomparable novelist. Distilling twenty years of thinking and writing about Austen, Tanner treats in fresh and illuminating ways the questions that have always occupied her most perceptive critics. How can we reconcile the limited social world of her novels with the largeness of her vision? How does she deal with depicting a once-stable society that was changing alarmingly during her lifetime? How does she express and control the sexuality and violence beneath the well-mannered surface of her milieu? How does she resolve the problems of communication among characters pinioned by social reticences?</p><p>Tanner guides us through Austen&#x2019;s novels from relatively sunny early works to the darker, more pessimistic <i>Persuasion</i> and fragmentary <i>Sanditon</i>&#x2015;a journey that takes her from acceptance of a society maintained by landed property, family, money, and strict propriety through an insistence on the need for authentication of these values to a final skepticism and even rejection. In showing her progress from a parochial optimism to an ability to encompass her whole society, Tanner renews our sense of Jane Austen as one of the great novelists, confirming both her local and abiding relevance.</p></p><p>Tony Tanner's classic text on Jane Austen addresses the issues that have always occupied the author's most perceptive critics, and offers an illuminating and refreshing analysis of Austen's novels. Tanner shows how Austen changed from a basically accepting view of 'society' to a more questioning one and considers the problems of authority, power and the position of women, as well as the relationship between ethics, language and behaviour. <br><br>This reissued edition features a new Preface by leading Romantic scholar Marilyn Gaull who examines Tanner's background and places the original work in context. Lively and informative, the Preface helps to reinforce and explain the continued importance of Tanner's work. Accompanied by an insightful Note on the Text by Austen scholar John Wiltshire, and an expanded Bibliography and Index, this is a timely republication of a study which is now regarded as one of the finest, and most accessible, introductions to a great novelist.Tony Tanner was Professor of English and American Literature at the University of Cambridge.</p><h2>The Marlinspike Sailor.</h2><p>Drawings of knots and rope items together with an explanatory text cover the basics of marlinspike seamanship</p><p>Hervey Garrett Smith was the foremost marine illustrator of the 1950s and 1960s, and his wonderful drawings of traditional ropework quickly propelled <i>The Marlinspike Sailor</i> to cult classic status when it was published in 1956. With the addition of a section on modern, synthetic rope in the 1970s, its popularity has continued undiminished to this day. It teaches a few basic knots--the bowline, sheet bend, and rolling hitch, among others--and splices in three-strand and braided rope. But its real business is decorative rope and canvaswork--the traditional arts of the sailor--and here it has no equal. For a rope mat, a rope ladder, a sea chest, a ditty bag, a canvas bucket, a mast boot, and the best-looking rope fenders or heaving line in the marina, this is the book of choice.<p><b>Hervey Garrett Smith</b> was a self-employed marine artist and writer.

As stand-ins for murder victims, they serve the needs of science - and the cause of justice. <p>For thirty years, Dr. Bass's research has revolutionized the field of forensic science, particularly by pinpointing "time since death" in murder cases. In this riveting book, he investigates real cases and leads readers on an unprecedented journey behind the locked gates of the Body Farm. A master scientist and an engaging storyteller, Bass shares his most intriguing work: his revisit of the Lindbergh kidnapping and murder, fifty years after the fact; the mystery of a headless corpse whose identity astonished the police; the telltale bugs that finally sent a murderous grandfather to death row; and many more.</p></p><p>Jon Jefferson is a veteran journalist, science writer, and documentary filmmaker. His writing has been featured by <b>The New York Times</b>, <b>Newsweek</b>, <b>USA Today</b>, and <b>Popular Science</b>.<p> <b>Chapter 1</b></p><p> A DOZEN TINY BONES, nestled in my palm: They were virtually all that remained, except for yellowed clippings, scratchy newsreel footage, and painful memories, from what was called "the trial of the century."</p><p> That label seems to get thrown around quite a lot, but in this case, maybe it was right. Seven years after the Scopes "Monkey Trial" and half a century before the O.J. Simpson debacle, America was mesmerized by a criminal investigation and murder trial that made headlines around the world. Now I was to decide whether justice had been done, or an innocent man had been wrongly executed.</p><p> The case was the kidnapping and death of a toddler named Charles Lindbergh Jr.-known far and wide as "the Lindbergh baby."</p><p> In 1927, Charles Lindbergh, a former barnstormer and airmail pilot, had flown a small, single-engine plane, the <i>Spirit of St. Louis,</i> across the Atlantic Ocean. He did it alone, with no radio or parachute or sextant, staying awake and on course for thirty-three hours straight. By the time he reached the coast of France, news of his flight had reached Paris, and Parisians by the thousands flocked to the airfield to welcome him. The moment he touched down, 3,600 miles after leaving New York, the world changed, and so did Charles Lindbergh's life. His achievement brought him fame, fortune, and a pair of nicknames: "Lucky Lindy," which he hated, and "the Lone Eagle," which reflected both his solo flight and his solitary nature.</p><p> Five years after he flew into the limelight, Lindbergh and his wife, Anne, were living in a secluded New Jersey mansion. They had a twenty-month-old son; his parents named him Charles Jr. but journalists called him "the Eaglet." It was the heyday of sensational journalism, and savvy reporters and publishers knew that a Lindbergh story-almost any Lindbergh story-was a surefire way to sell newspapers. So when the heir and namesake of Charles Lindbergh was kidnapped, a media frenzy broke out: The case attracted more journalists than World War I had. The ransom notes-at first demanding $50,000, then later upping the ante to $70,000-made front-page headlines and newsreel footage; so did the claims, emerging from towns throughout America, that the Lindbergh baby had been found alive and well. But all those claims, and all those hopes, were laid to rest two months after the kidnapping, when a small child's body was found in the woods a few miles from the Lindbergh mansion. The body was badly decomposed; the left leg was missing below the knee, as were the left hand and right arm-chewed off, it appeared, by animals.</p><p> On the basis of the body's size, the clothing, and a distinctive abnormality in the one remaining foot-three toes that overlapped-the remains were quickly identified as the Lindbergh baby's. The next day they were cremated, and a brokenhearted Charles Lindbergh flew out over the Atlantic, alone once more, to scatter his son's ashes. No one called him Lucky Lindy now.</p><p> The police eventually arrested a German immigrant named Bruno Hauptmann, a carpenter whose garage rafters had apparently been used to construct a makeshift ladder used to reach the Lindberghs' second-floor nursery. Hauptmann was arrested after police traced a large portion of the ransom money to him. He was charged with kidnapping and murder: The baby's skull had been fractured, though the injury might actually have resulted from a fall, since the ladder broke during the abduction. Despite allegations that some of the evidence against him was suspect or fabricated, Hauptmann was convicted. He died in the electric chair in April of 1936.</p><p> Fifty years after the crime, in June of 1982, I was contacted by an attorney representing Bruno Hauptmann's widow, Anna. All these years after his execution, Mrs. Hauptmann was still trying to clear her husband's name. Her only chance was a dozen tiny bones. Recovered from the crime scene after the body's cremation, they had been carefully preserved ever since by the New Jersey State Police. At the request of Mrs. Hauptmann's attorney, I drove up to Trenton to see if this handful of scattered bones might somehow show that the body had been incorrectly identified-that a rush to judgment had triggered a terrible miscarriage of justice. Let them be the bones of a younger boy, an older boy, a girl of any age, she must have prayed. Anything but the bones of Charles Lindbergh Jr.</p><p> I was her final hope-a small-town scientist backing up traffic at a tollbooth as I asked directions to the headquarters of the New Jersey State Police.</p><p> It was a long and fascinating road that had brought me to Trenton, and by that I don't mean the New Jersey Turnpike. What had brought me here was a path that once pointed toward an uneventful career in counseling but that suddenly veered off in the direction of corpses, crime scenes, and courtrooms.</p><p> My forensic career began as a result of an early-morning traffic accident outside Frankfort, Kentucky, in the winter of 1954. On a damp, foggy morning, two trucks collided in a fiery crash on a two-lane highway. When the fire was out, three bodies, burned beyond recognition, were found in the vehicles. The identities of both drivers were easily confirmed, but the third body was a bit of a mystery.</p><p> By sheer but momentous coincidence, some months after that accident, The Saturday Evening Post carried an article about Dr. Wilton M. Krogman, the most famous "bone detective" of the 1940s and '50s. Krogman was a physical anthropologist who, along with two Smithsonian colleagues, virtually created the science of forensic anthropology. He was considered such a great forensic authority that during World War II, the U.S. government had him waiting in the wings to identify the remains of Adolf Hitler. As it turned out, the Russians beat the Americans to the burned-out bunker containing Hitler's bones, so Krogman never got a look at the Fnhrer. But he had plenty of other forensic cases, from the police and the FBI, to keep him busy.</p><p> In the <i>Post</i> article, Krogman mentioned several other scientists who also specialized in identifying human skeletal remains. One of those he named was Dr. Charles E. Snow, an anthropology professor at the University of Kentucky, where I was pursuing a master's degree in counseling. The school, Dr. Snow, and I were all located in Lexington, just thirty miles from the scene of that early-morning truck collision. Although I didn't know it at the time, I was about to collide head-on with my future.</p><p> A Lexington lawyer who read the article realized that Dr. Snow might be able to identify the third victim of the fiery crash. He called Dr. Snow, who readily agreed to examine the remains. At the time, I was taking an anthropology class from Dr. Snow just for fun. When he got the lawyer's call, Snow asked if I would be interested in accompanying him on a human-identification case. This was a chance to apply, to a real-world case, scientific techniques that so far I had only read about. Why was I the one student he invited to go along? Perhaps he appreciated my budding brilliance; perhaps what he appreciated was the fact that I had a car to get us there. In any case, I jumped at the chance.</p><p> The body had been buried months before, so the lawyer completed the necessary paperwork to authorize an exhumation. On a warm spring day in April of 1955, Dr. Snow and I drove to a small cemetery beside a little country church in east-central Kentucky. By the time we arrived, the grave had been excavated and the coffin uncovered. Spring rains had raised the water table almost to ground level, so the coffin was immersed in water. As it was hoisted from the grave by a cemetery truck, water poured from every seam.</p><p> The body was burned, rotted, and waterlogged-quite a contrast to the immaculate bone specimens I had studied in the university's osteology lab. Traditional anthropological specimens are clean and dry; forensic cases tend to be wet and smelly. But they're intellectually irresistible too: scientific puzzles demanding to be solved, life-and-death secrets waiting to be unearthed.</p><p> From the smallness of the skull, the width of the pelvic opening, and the smoothness of the eyebrow ridge, even my inexperienced eye could see that these bones came from a female. Her age was a bit trickier: The wisdom teeth were fully formed, so she was an adult, but how old? The zigzag seams in the cranium, called sutures, were mostly fused together but still clearly visible; that suggested she was in her thirties or forties.</p><p> As it turned out, the police already had a pretty good idea whose body this was. Dr. Snow's job was simply to confirm or refute the tentative identification. An eastern Kentucky woman had been missing since the time of the accident; what's more, the night before the wreck, neighbors had overheard her say that she was riding to Louisville with one of the truck drivers, a man with whom she'd had a longtime relationship.</p><p> The lawyer who enlisted Dr. Snow's help had already obtained the missing woman's medical records and dental X rays. Armed with this information, Dr. Snow swiftly matched her teeth and fillings with those appearing in the X rays. By confirming her identity, Dr. Snow gave the lawyer a solid legal basis for a liability claim on behalf of the woman's surviving relatives. It seems that she and her boyfriend were killed when the other truck swerved across the highway's centerline and struck them head-on. The truck that killed them was owned by a nationwide grocery chain-The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, or A&amp;P-so there were deep pockets to be tapped in court.</p><p> Dr. Snow's consulting fee for the case was $25; he handed over $5 of that to me for taking us to the cemetery in my car. I suspect the lawyer extracted a good deal more than that from the cash registers of A&amp;P.</p><p> I didn't get rich that day, but I sure got hooked. It was fascinating to see the way burned and broken bones could identify a victim, solve a long-standing mystery, close a case. From that moment on, I decided, I would focus on forensics. I turned my back on counseling, switched to anthropology, and set about making up for lost time.</p><p>...</p></p><h2>Postcards from the Boys</h2><p>Whenever John, Paul, or George went on a trip, they would send Ringo a postcard. Now, for the first time, Ringo Starr is opening his private archive to share this delightful and very intimate correspondence. Whether it's John advising Ringo to record a "great &amp; simple" song like Blondie's <i>Heart of Glass</i>, Paul and Jane Asher dropping a note from Rishikesh to report on their meditation lessons with the Maharishi, or George writing from the Great Barrier Reef to confirm plans for Christmas dinner, each postcard is a warm and personal snapshot of life in (and after) The Beatles. The 51 postcards -- many of which are covered in whimsical drawings -- are colorfully reproduced, both front and back. Ringo's droll commentary fills in the blanks, though he does confess that at times he had to consult the Internet for details! Often funny, occasionally bittersweet, and always revealing, <i>Postcards from the Boys</i> is a must for Beatles lovers.</p><p>Ringo Starr &#34;the greatest drummer in the world,&#34; according to Paul McCartney, released the album Ringo Rama in 2003.Ringo loved to receive mail, especially from his band mates. Didn't matter much what the notes said&#x2014;"everything here is still going well, except we miss you," "doing nothing at all" or "YOU ARE THE GREATEST DRUMMER IN THE WORLD"&#x2014;he saved them, and now, 38 years after getting a postcard from Paul from Spain ("not understanding a word but having fun"), he shares them in this intimate, funny and moving collection. The fronts of the cards are displayed on left-hand pages&#x2014;there are Copenhagen rooftops, topless Zulu women, topless Australian scuba divers, Prince Charles, the Statue of Liberty, topless Hawaiian ukulele players&#x2014;while the backs appear on right-hand pages. The notes allow readers into an insider club of sorts, shedding light on the good, the bad and making music, and Ringo offers commentary below each one. For example, after a note from John and Yoko saying, "Who'd have thought it would come to this...." Ringo recalls, "This was a hell time because it was the family break-up." Another card, from Paul, reads, "YOU GOT THAT SOMETHING." Asks Ringo, "What was happening in my life here? Do you know?" Perhaps what these missives best illuminate is the deep friendship that existed among "the boys," despite all that was going on with the Beatles and in the world, proving, perhaps, that all you need is love. 100+ color photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Systematic theologian Fred Sanders, in <em>The Deep Things of God,</em> shows why we ought to embrace the doctrine of the Trinity wholeheartedly and without reserve, as a central concern of evangelical theology.</p> <p>Sanders demonstrates, with passion and conviction, that the doctrine of the Trinity is grounded in the gospel itself. Written accessibly, <em>The Deep Things of God</em> examines the centrality of the Trinity in our salvation and the Trinity&#x2019;s presence in the reading of the Bible and prayer. Readers will understand that a robust doctrine of the Trinity has massive implications for their lives. Indeed, recognizing the work of the Trinity in the gospel changes everything, restoring depth to prayer, worship, Bible study, missions, tradition, and our understanding of Christianity&#x2019;s fundamental doctrines.</p></p><p><p><strong>Fred Sanders</strong> (PhD, Graduate Theological Union) is professor of theology at the Torrey Honors Institute at Biola University. Sanders is the author of&nbsp;<em>The Deep Things of God</em>&nbsp;and blogs at ScriptoriumDaily.com.</p><p>&#x201c;At last, a practical guide to the most fundamental doctrine of them all. Mr Sanders shows us how the Trinity is the essential framework on which our faith is built, the hidden skeleton that gives shape and meaning to the flesh and blood of daily experience. Highly commended!&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Gerald Bray</strong><strong>, </strong>Research Professor of Divinity, History, and Doctrine, Beeson Divinity School;&nbsp;author, <em>God Is Love </em>and <em>God Has Spoken</em></p><p>&#x201c;Sanders has a gift for making the deep things of theology&#x2014;in this case, the doctrine of the Trinity&#x2014;clear and compelling rather than shallow and simplistic. This is as good an introduction to the essentially Trinitarian shape of evangelical faith and practice of which I&#x2019;m aware. Every evangelical should be able to explain how the gospel is Trinitarian and the Trinity a summation of the gospel, and Sanders shows us how. He makes a convincing case that there is nothing wrong with the evangelical church in North American that a good dose of Trinitarian theology, if absorbed into the bloodstream of the body of Christ, could not cure. So take, drink, and prepare to be edified.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Kevin J. Vanhoozer</strong>, Research Professor of Systematic Theology, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School; author, <em>Biblical Authority after Babel&nbsp;</em>and<em> Faith Speaking Understanding</em> &nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Fred Sanders&#x2019; book should be required reading for anyone involved in the work of the Gospel.

God's Triune majesty is brought down to our daily prayers and life as believers. Anyone who wants to know their great God better will be blessed by meditating on the scriptural and practical truth in this book. Any Christian leader who wants to ground his local congregation in the life of the Three-in-One God will find both biblical depth and devotional insight to help him. In The Deep Things of God Fred Sanders makes clear what we tacitly know, that 'the gospel is trinitarian and the Trinity is the gospel.' This book shows the same wisdom Fred has shown in ministering in our church. The Deep Things of God shows that the faith which we held so delicately at our baptism is an expression of our personal relationship with Father, Son and Spirit. We live out The Deep Things of God every time we pray to the Father by the Son and through the Spirit. It is my prayer that the whole church will embrace The Deep Things of God and celebrate our relationship to the Trinity in the life of the church.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Scott Carpenter</strong>, Elder, Grace Fellowship Church, Costa Mesa, CA</p><p>&#x201c;There simply aren't enough superlatives to describe how important and timely this book is. Sanders demonstrates how the Trinity is at the heart of the Gospel and the foundation of the Christian life, and makes his case by bringing forward distinctly evangelical voices. But this is no book of abstract theology: Sanders' work is lively, engaging, and accessible. He brings the Trinity out of the cloistered walls of academia and into the living room, explaining in terms anyone can understand that we are immersed in the reality of the Triune God. There is no better guide I know of to explore the deep things of God than this book, and it deserves a wide and serious hearing by pastors, theologians, and laymen alike.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<strong>Matthew Lee Anderson</strong><strong>,</strong> Founder, Mere Orthodoxy; author, <em>The End of Our Exploring: A Book About Questioning and the Confidence of Faith</em></p><p>&#x201c;Deep Things of God is a fascinating exploration of the trinitarian heartbeat of the gospel which underlies the rich (though often ignored) practices of evangelicalism. Fred Sanders wears his considerable learning lightly; this is a book I'm going to buy for my parents and recommend to my fellow doctoral students.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Ben Rhodes</strong>, PhD candidate in Systematic Theology, Kings College, University of Aberdeen</p></p><h2>Happy for No Reason: 7 Steps to Being Happy from the Inside Out</h2><p>What would it take to make you happy?

Then they made three long columns and began listing their dreams, big and small. When they shared their goals afterward, they were invariably all fired up: people wanted to go scuba diving in the Great Barrier Reef, own a Mercedes SL600 Roadster (cream white, with titanium silver alloy wheels), dance at the White House, fly a small plane around the world. They wanted to rise to the top of their field, end world hunger, create world peace, be on the cover of <i>Time</i> magazine. </p><p> Somewhere on the be list a few people wrote "Be happy," but I was surprised at how often most people overlooked that. That's what the whole page was about, wasn't it? Didn't being, doing, and having all these things equal happiness? </p><p> Over time, I've come to look back on those lists as a great example of taking the long way around. Big and wonderful as those things are, they aren't the ultimate thing we all want. If you cut to the chase, what we really want is to be happy. </p><p> The truth is that happiness is so compelling, so attractive -- so irresistible -- that whether you realize it or not, everything you do is aimed at making yourself happy. Happiness has been called the holy grail of human existence, the be-all and end-all of life. Aristotle called it the goal of all goals. </p><p> Studies around the world show that when people are asked to rank what they want from life, they put the desire to be happy at the top of the list, more important than wealth, status, a good job, fame, and sex. This is true for people of all cultures, races, religions, ages, and lifestyles. And research also shows how vital happiness is: happy people live longer, are healthier, and have better relationships. In fact, happiness leads to more success in every area of your life. </p><p> Unfortunately, many people are not experiencing much sustained, authentic happiness. Consider these sad statistics: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Less than 30 percent of people report being deeply happy. </p><p> Twenty-five percent of Americans and 27 percent of Europeans claim they are depressed. </p><p> The World Health Organization predicts that by 2020, depression will be second only to heart disease in terms of the global burden of illness. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Although our lifestyles are better than ever, we're unhappier than ever. It seems the more gadgets and goods we gather, the worse we feel. </p><p> In this book, I'm not going to show you directly how to make more money, be more successful, or have better relationships. I leave that to my friends and colleagues in the transformational world who do that all so well. What I <i>am</i> going to do is tell you what I would most want to know. This book answers the question I've spent the past thirty-five years studying and researching, the one that is most important to me -- and that I believe is also most important to you: <b>How can I be truly happy?</b> </p><p> Although this question absorbed me for most of my life, for years I didn't have much luck answering it. In fact, I spent most of that time barking up the wrong tree. </p><p> <b>One Unhappy Camper </b> I had imagined it all as a child: I would grow up, live in a beautiful house, have a wonderful husband and a great career. My body would be perfect and my social life fun and exciting. I would be <i>happy!</i> </p><p> To live that life of my dreams, I knew I'd have to work hard to get all my ducks in a row. And although I was clear about what I wanted, I wasn't sure how I'd get it. The only thing I knew for sure was that I wasn't happy. I came out of the womb filled with existential angst. I was the brooding five-year-old who was worrying about the condition of the world while everyone else was watching <i>Romper Room</i>. At age seven, I was grilling my wonderful, loving parents about God and spirituality and becoming frustrated that they couldn't answer my questions. When I look through family albums, I see my brother and sister beaming at the camera while I always look as though I've just lost my best friend. </p><p> Even though I wasn't a naturally happy person, something deep within me knew that I didn't have to accept that way of being. It was as if I had some kind of antenna tuned to whatever I needed to learn most. When I was eleven, I slathered myself in suntan oil and snuck into my sister's room to steal a book to read while sunbathing. I grabbed the skinniest one, since I'd always been a slow reader, and headed outside. By the time I was halfway through the book, Hermann Hesse's <i>Siddhartha</i>, the story of a young Indian man on a quest for enlightenment thousands of years ago, I was in tears. I recognized that I wasn't alone; someone else on the planet understood my search and shared my longing for connection and joy. That book put me on the path of seeking. </p><p> While other girls were perfecting their stag leap for cheerleading tryouts, I was taking self-development courses. When I was thirteen, I heard my first motivational speaker, Zig Ziglar. As I watched him walk back and forth across the stage, revealing the secrets of success and telling stories that gave me goosebumps, lightning struck. I realized that being a professional speaker was what I wanted to do. It was a strange career goal for a young teenage girl in the early 1970s. Even so, I pictured myself speaking in front of large audiences all over the world, inspiring people to change their lives for the better. My parents were supportive, even though my father was a dentist and they really wanted me to be a dental hygienist. Mom said, "You sure talk enough, so you might as well get paid for it." </p><p> I moved my Nancy Drew mysteries to the side to make room for every humanistic psychology book I could lay my hands on. I devoured them. At the age of sixteen, I began meditating every day, and by the time I turned twenty, I was a teacher of meditation. Though meditating had a profound impact on my life, I was still searching. </p><p> As time passed, I never lost sight of my goal of becoming a speaker. I immersed myself in success principles and did my best to put every one into practice. I tithed a percentage of my income and visualized my goals. I made vision boards to help me picture those goals and discovered I had a gift for manifesting my desires. For example, after earning my MBA, I drew to myself a wonderful job that included many qualities I had always yearned for in a career. As vice president of marketing for a company that sold Austrian crystal, I was responsible for training and inspiring employees. I loved it! I taught them everything I'd studied in my own life: the principles of the Law of Attraction, being clear about what you want, and knowing how to harness your intuition, overcome obstacles, and achieve your goals. </p><p> From there, I moved on to teaching those same principles of success as a corporate trainer for Fortune 500 companies and then for a national seminar company speaking to large audiences of women all over the country. With every new position came a bigger paycheck and more kudos. But I wasn't exactly happy. I knew there was something still missing. I just couldn't tell you what it was. </p><p> Maybe it was my subject matter, I decided. So instead of teaching success seminars, I began to teach self-esteem seminars for women. Jack Canfield, the nation's top expert on self-esteem, became my amazing mentor -- years before he created the mega-best-selling book series <i>Chicken Soup for the Soul</i> -- and soon I was giving keynotes to two or three hundred women a day on self-esteem. I taught on my high heels from 7:00 in the morning until late afternoon, then jumped in a car and drove three hours to the next city, day after day after day. It was exhausting but exhilarating. I loved standing in front of my audiences and watching their faces light up. Yet I still felt it wasn't quite enough -- I wanted to reach more people. </p><p> Then came my big break. It began with a decision to take care of myself. Burned out from all my traveling, I signed up for a seven-day silence retreat, a real challenge for a Chatty Cathy like me. On the fourth day, in the middle of meditation, the proverbial lightbulb clicked on. I flashed on a title: <i>Chicken Soup for the Woman's Soul</i>. Up to this point, only the original <i>Chicken Soup</i> book had been published, and I knew this idea was a colossal winner. I was so excited; I'd just had the epiphany of my career. The only problem was I had to stay silent for three more days! The minute the retreat ended, I ran to the nearest payphone and called Jack. A year and a half later, <i>Chicken Soup for the Woman's Soul </i>became a #1 <i>New York Times</i> best-seller and I went on to write five more <i>Chicken Soup for the Soul</i> books that have sold over 13 million copies. </p><p> There I was, on national TV and radio shows, giving speeches to huge audiences, being treated like a queen and living the whirlwind life of success. At one conference, I was picked up in a white stretch limo to speak to a crowd of 8,000. Throughout the three-day event, thousands of women stood in a line that stretched around the entire convention center waiting for me to sign their books. A massage therapist rubbed my hands every hour as I autographed copy after copy after copy -- so many they had to be airlifted from every corner of the country to meet the demand. Many women in the autograph line told me my books had changed, or even saved, their lives. I was deeply moved by their stories and felt good that I had done something that made a difference. But when I went to my hotel room each night, I flopped on the bed, feeling drained and strangely flat. </p><p> You'd think I'd have been on top of the world. But I wasn't. Sure, my ego had gotten a boost, but I still had the same worries, tensions, complaints, and bad hair days as everyone else.

I can always tell when Bernie&#x2019;s nervous&#x2014;which hardly ever happens, and never when we&#x2019;re in action&#x2014;because his smell sharpens a bit, although it&#x2019;s still the best human smell there is: apples, bourbon, salt and pepper. But now, up on the stage, he was doing great.<br><br>&#x201c;Which, um,&#x201d; he was saying, &#x201c;reminds me of a joke. &#x201c;Sort of. Maybe not a joke,&#x201d; he went on, turning a page, &#x201c;more like a&#x2014;&#x201d; and at that moment the whole wad of papers somehow jumped out of his hands, all the pages gliding down in different directions. He bent and started gathering them up. That gave me a chance, sitting a few rows back, to recoy or recon&#x2014;or something like that&#x2014;the joint, always important in our line of work, as Bernie often said.<br><br>We were in a conference room at a hotel near the airport, and everyone in the audience&#x2014;maybe not quite as big as it had been at the beginning, when Bernie had tapped the microphone, a painful sound for me, pounding like drums right next to my ears, although no one else seemed to mind, cleared his throat, and said, &#x201c;Can, uh, you hear me all right?&#x201d; a terrific start, in my opinion&#x2014; was a private eye, on account of this was the Great Western Private Eye Convention. We&#x2019;re partners in the Little Detective Agency, me and Bernie, Bernie&#x2019;s last name being Little. I&#x2019;m Chet, pure and simple, and we&#x2019;d been in business for almost as long as I could remember, although we&#x2019;d never been to a convention before. &#x201c;Not our thing,&#x201d; Bernie said, so that was that, until Georgie Malhouf, president of the Great Western Private Eye Association, offered Bernie five hundred bucks to give a speech.<br><br>&#x201c;A speech?&#x201d; Bernie had said.<br><br>&#x201c;Twenty minutes, tops,&#x201d; Georgie Malhouf told him. &#x201c;Plus questions.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never given a speech in my life.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So what?&#x201d; said Georgie Malhouf. &#x201c;There was also a time in your life when you hadn&#x2019;t had sex. Did that stop you?&#x201d;<br><br>That one zipped right by me, but the point was: five hundred bucks. Our finances were a mess. We hadn&#x2019;t worked an actual case&#x2014;not even divorce, which we hated&#x2014;in I didn&#x2019;t know how long, plus there was the hit we&#x2019;d taken from the tin futures thing, and don&#x2019;t get me started on the stacks and stacks of Hawaiian pants, locked away at our self-storage in Pedroia; we hadn&#x2019;t sold a single pair. Why they hadn&#x2019;t caught on was a mystery to me: didn&#x2019;t everybody love Hawaiian shirts? Bernie had lots of them, was wearing one of my favorites right now up on that stage, the blue number with the gold trumpets.<br><br>He picked up the pages, or most of them, and tried to get them back into some kind of order. Meanwhile, I heard feet shuffling out of the room behind me, and across the aisle I was sitting in both Mirabelli brothers seemed to be asleep, their mouths hanging open. On my other side sat Georgie Malhouf, a real skinny guy with sunken cheeks and a thick black mustache. There&#x2019;s something about mustaches that makes it hard for me to look away, so I didn&#x2019;t. After some time, I noticed that Georgie was looking at me, too.<br><br>&#x201c;On the ball, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Just like they say.&#x201d;<br><br>Ball? I&#x2019;m just about always in the mood to play ball. A very faint thought arose in my mind, something about this maybe not being a good time for playing ball; but it sank quickly away, and I kept my eyes on Georgie Malhouf, waiting for him to produce a ball from somewhere. No ball appeared. Georgie Malhouf was keeping his eyes, small and dark, on me.<br><br>&#x201c;Ten grand sound about right?&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Numbers aren&#x2019;t my best thing&#x2014;I stop at two, a perfect number in my opinion&#x2014;but when it came to money anything with grand in it got us excited, me and Bernie. He was bumping us up to ten grand? Bernie&#x2019;s speech was going even better than I&#x2019;d thought.<br><br><i>BAM BAM BAM.</i> Bernie was tapping the microphone again. &#x201c;Hear me all right?&#x201d; He glanced up at the audience, from which came no response, and then quickly down to the papers in his hand. For some reason, he was holding them kind of close to his face, and they weren&#x2019;t quite steady.<br><br>&#x201c;This, uh, joke&#x2014;maybe more like a ...&#x201d; He lapsed into silence, a silence that seemed rather long&#x2014;although the room was getting noisier, with more movement toward the doors behind me&#x2014;then cleared his throat again, so forcefully it had to hurt, and said very loudly, almost a shout: &#x201c;Riddle!&#x201d; He toned it down a bit. &#x201c;Riddle. That&#x2019;s it. Here comes the riddle: What did the duck say to the horse?&#x201d; He glanced up in an abrupt sort of way and scanned the audience, what was left of it.<br><br>What did the duck say to the horse? Was that what Bernie had just said?<br><br>&#x201c;Anybody?&#x201d; Bernie said. &#x201c;Duck? Horse?&#x201d;<br><br>No response. I knew horses, of course, prima donnas each and every one. I&#x2019;d also had an encounter with a duck, in the middle of a lake in the border country on our way back from a case we&#x2019;d been working down Mexico way. Nipped me right on the nose, which came as a big surprise. But horses and ducks together? I had nothing to offer.<br><br>Up on stage, Bernie opened his mouth, closed it, opened it again. &#x201c;&#x2018;Why the long face?&#x2019;&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Silence.<br><br>Bernie reached out, maybe thinking of tapping the microphone again, but did not. &#x201c;Duck?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Noting the horse&#x2019;s different physiognomy, which was the topic of my speech, facial classifications? A funny little approach to the subject at hand?&#x201d;<br><br>More silence.<br><br>Bernie shuffled through the papers. &#x201c;And I guess that more or less ... brings us to the end of the prepared remarks.&#x201d; What was the word for when humans talk but you can&#x2019;t understand a thing? Muttering? Yeah. Bernie was muttering now. &#x201c;Happy to take any questions,&#x201d; he went on, or something like that.<br><br>There were no questions.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, then, it&#x2019;s time to, uh ... thanks. Yeah. Thanks. You&#x2019;ve been a great, um.&#x201d; Bernie raised his hand in a funny sort of wave, a page or two flying free, and started walking off the stage. Then came the applause. I heard it for sure, but my sense of hearing&#x2019;s probably better than yours, no offense.<br><br>&#x201c;Fantastic, Bernie,&#x201d; Georgie Malhouf was saying. We were at a corner table in the bar of the airport hotel, and by now Bernie had stopped sweating. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a natural-born public speaker.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Never seen anything like it.&#x201d; A fresh round of drinks came, beer for Bernie and Georgie Malhouf, water in a nice big soup bowl for me. Georgie clinked Bernie&#x2019;s glass. &#x201c;Why the long face,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Priceless. When did you make that one up?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Make it up?&#x201d; said Bernie. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t really say I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not just a natural-born public speaker,&#x201d; Georgie said, &#x201c;but a natural-born communicator in general.&#x201d; He handed Bernie a check. &#x201c;Here you go, pal. Earned every penny.&#x201d;<br><br>I watched carefully till Bernie folded the check and put it in his pocket, not his shirt pocket, where we&#x2019;d run into problems before, or his back pants pocket, also unreliable once or twice in the past, but the front pants pocket, safe and sound with the car keys.<br><br>&#x201c;Bourbon still your drink, Bernie?&#x201d; Georgie said. &#x201c;How about a shot of something to go along with that beer?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A little early for&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Miss!&#x201d;<br><br>Two shots of bourbon arrived. Glasses got clinked again.<br><br>&#x201c;Communicators aren&#x2019;t exactly thick on the ground in this business,&#x201d; Georgie said. I could make out a stretch of ground through the window, saw nothing but a parking lot with a red car pulling in. &#x201c;So why don&#x2019;t I cut to the chase?&#x201d;<br><br>That was the kind of thing I liked to hear. I got my back paws up under me, ready to move.<br><br>Bernie lowered his glass, tilted his head slightly to one side. That was a sign of his brain clicking into gear, and Bernie&#x2019;s brain was one of the best things we had going for us at the Little Detective Agency. His brain and my nose: plenty of perps now wearing orange jump suits can tell you about that combo.<br><br>&#x201c;Life&#x2019;s not fair,&#x201d; Georgie went on, losing me right away. &#x201c;Man of your ability.&#x201d; He shook his head.<br><br>&#x201c;No complaints,&#x201d; Bernie said.<br><br>&#x201c;See, right there&#x2014;the quality factor,&#x201d; said Georgie. He took out a pack of cigarettes, offered one to Bernie. Bernie had quit smoking lots of times, but right now we were in the middle of one of his best efforts.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s smoking in here,&#x201d; Bernie said.<br><br>&#x201c;Hotel&#x2019;s a client,&#x201d; said Georgie. &#x201c;Live a little.&#x201d;<br><br>They lit up. Bernie took a deep drag, let the smoke out with a sigh. Poor Bernie. Smoke drifted over toward me. I was smelling how pleasant it smelled when I noticed the red car parking right beside our ride. Our ride&#x2019;s a Porsche, but not the new fancy kind. It&#x2019;s brown with yellow doors, very old, and the top went missing back when we were working the Hobbs case, a story for another time. A woman sat behind the wheel of the red car; she didn&#x2019;t seem in a hurry to get out.<br><br>Georgie sipped his drink. &#x201c;Like this bourbon?&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Very nice,&#x201d; Bernie said.<br><br>&#x201c;Tell you the truth, Bern,&#x201d; Georgie began, and I missed some of what came next, on account of: <i>Bern.</i> Bernie hated that! In fact, the last guy who&#x2019;d tried it, a carjacker from the East Valley, name escaping me at the moment, was now breaking rocks in the hot sun. Were we about to take down Georgie Malhouf? His mustache was really starting to bother me.<br><br>&#x201c;... whole chain&#x2019;s a client,&#x201d; Georgie was saying, &#x201c;including the Arbuckle Palace in LA. Check out the world around us. Security&#x2014;my kind&#x2014;is only going to get bigger.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the other kind?&#x201d; Bernie said.<br><br>Georgie made a motion with his hand, like he was waving away flying insects, although there were none around.

Birds are much quieter when they fly, kind of crazy.<br><br>&#x201c;The other kind,&#x201d; Georgie said, &#x201c;is the lone wolf.&#x201d; He leaned forward, wagged his finger at Bernie. &#x201c;Headed for rapid extinction, Bern.&#x201d; Sometimes things go by so fast you can&#x2019;t keep up. For example, Georgie&#x2019;s wagging finger had curly black hair on the back, always interesting, but there was no time to dwell on it, not if wolves were suddenly in the picture. I knew wolves, but only from Animal Planet. I glanced around the bar: no wolves, no creatures of any kind, except humans and me. But the fur on my neck was up and stiff.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m offering you a job,&#x201d; Georgie said. He looked over at me. &#x201c;You and Chet, of course.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You mean you want to subcontract a case out to us?&#x201d; Bernie said.<br><br>&#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; said Georgie. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m talking about a real permanent-type job, assistant VP Operations, Malhouf International Investigations, eighty-five K to start, plus benefits and two weeks&#x2019; paid vacation.&#x201d;<br><br>Bernie shook his head, a very quick side-to-side. Charlie&#x2014; that&#x2019;s Bernie&#x2019;s kid, who we don&#x2019;t see nearly enough since the divorce&#x2014;has the exact same headshake. All of a sudden Bernie looked younger.<br><br>Georgie sat back in his chair. His eyes, dark to begin with, darkened some more. &#x201c;Not even going to think about it?&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;I appreciate the offer,&#x201d; Bernie said. &#x201c;But it wouldn&#x2019;t be a good fit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be the judge of that,&#x201d; Georgie said.<br><br>&#x201c;See?&#x201d; said Bernie, and he laughed.<br><br>Bernie has a great laugh, so much fun to listen to&#x2014;the way it comes from deep down&#x2014;but Georgie didn&#x2019;t seem to be enjoying it. &#x201c;Always considered you a serious individual, Bern,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Must be some reason you&#x2019;re not taking me seriously.&#x201d;<br><br>Bernie shrugged.<br><br>Georgie leaned forward. &#x201c;I do my research. That means I know what you&#x2019;ve been making. Or not making, to put it more accurately. Christ, I know about the tin futures. And even the goddamn pants. What else? You&#x2019;re late on your kid&#x2019;s tuition and you&#x2019;re upside down on your house.&#x201d;<br><br>Upside down on our house? I gave up on understanding Georgie. But whatever he was talking about seemed to have gotten to Bernie. When Bernie&#x2019;s angry, a little jaw muscle starts clenching, and it was clenching now. He put down his drink and started to rise. &#x201c;Thanks for the drink,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The answer&#x2019;s no.&#x201d;<br><br>Georgie shrugged; I always watch for that one. &#x201c;Gotta do what you gotta do,&#x201d; he said, rising too. He took something from his pocket, something that looked like another check, and held it out to Bernie.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d; Bernie said, not taking it.<br><br>&#x201c;Ten grand,&#x201d; Georgie said.<br><br>&#x201c;What the hell?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not for you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s for Chet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; Bernie said. Ten grand! Maybe it was a prize or something. I&#x2019;d once won a whole box of Slim Jims at an agility contest, but no time to go into that now. All I thought was: take the money!<br><br>&#x201c;I want to buy Chet,&#x201d; Georgie said. &#x201c;Have him come work for us.&#x201d;<br><br>What was this? Something without Bernie?<br><br>&#x201c;Chet&#x2019;s not for sale,&#x201d; Bernie said. His face had gone pale, practically white. &#x201c;Not now, not ever.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fifteen grand,&#x201d; Georgie said. &#x201c;Final offer.&#x201d;<br><br>Bernie didn&#x2019;t touch the ten-grand check.

Circumstances thwart our best-laid plans. We struggle to live a heartfelt life. Worst of all, says Eldredge, the modern church mistakenly teaches its people to kill desire (calling it sin) and replace it with duty or obligation (calling it sanctification). As a result, at best Christians tend to live safe, boring lives of resignation. At worst, their desire eventually breaks out in destructive ways such as substance abuse, affairs, and pornography addictions. In <b><i>The Journey of Desire</i></b>, Eldredge invites readers to rediscover God-given desire and to search again for the life they once dreamed of.</p></p><p>Christian lecturer and counselor John Eldredge follows up his bestselling <i>Sacred Romance</i> with <i>The Journey of Desire: Searching for the Life We Always Dreamed Of</i>, a book whose very title evokes hope and possibility. The first half of <i>Journey of Desire</i> argues that Christians have forsaken their heart's desire due to the failures and sorrows of life. This is tragic, Eldredge insists, because "absolutely nothing of human greatness is ever accomplished without it." A rousing call to search for the life you've only dreamed of ensues. The question naturally arises as to the "wayward" desire that lies within us, and how it is to be controlled let alone differentiated from our <i>true</i> desires. While the answer isn't clear, the second half of the book focuses on what Christians have to look forward to in heaven--what they are to set their hope upon. Each chapter begins with insightful literary quotes and aptly applied modern song lyrics pertaining to the upcoming text. While the contents could fuel many a theological debate, Eldredge does inspire one to consider what lies in the recesses of his heart, and for Christians hopefully it is a primarily desire for God alone. <i>--Jill Heatherly</i><p><strong>John Eldredge</strong> is the founder and codirector, with his wife, of Ransomed Heart Ministries in Colorado Springs, Colorado, a fellowship devoted to helping people recover and live from their heart.

Kate&#39;s family, the seven O&#39;Malleys, were orphaned or abandoned as children; they chose to become their own family.

Flip through the thick, glossy pages and greet the greats of all ages. Lillian and Dorothy Gish share a spread with Blythe Danner and Gwyneth Paltrow. Ms. Deneuve, resplendent in scarlet, meet Mr. Valentino, in classy black and white. Claudette Colbert as Cleopatra, meet Liz Taylor as Cleopatra (and if it's not too catty, did you notice Claudette was better dressed?). The stunning photos are cleverly juxtaposed. Julia Roberts, posed naughtily in see-through undies in the water, is followed by a very properly attired Doris Day in a see-through skirt. Day holds six brightly dyed poodles by white leashes; the composition forms a visual rhyme with the six accusing fingers pointed at Peter Lorre in the next picture. The photo captions by Christopher Hitchens are as succinctly clever as Dorothy Parker, encapsulating entire careers in a punning paragraph. Even if you've seen a shot before, you learn things: in the most notorious still ever snapped at a Hollywood party--the one where Sophia Loren ogled Jayne Mansfield's voluminous bosom--Hitchens tells us the object of Loren's appalled regard was "the strategic dabs of makeup on [Jayne's] nipples."<p> Like any good party, this vast book offers sparkling talk as well as gobs of eye candy. The brilliant Peter Biskind evokes the '70s heyday of superagent Sue Mengers, D.H. Lawrence makes a stab at defining "sex appeal," Patricia Bosworth adds the patented <i>VF</i> dash of scandal in a piece on Lana Turner's gangster boyfriend's murder, and Hitchens gives a quickie history of the fabled Sunset Strip. Not everything rises to the august occasion: Carl Sandburg's poem about Chaplin and Clare Boothe Luce's snooty ode to Garbo are mostly of antiquarian interest. Most of the historic stuff is great (e.g., Fritz Lang directing a crowd scene in <i>Metropolis</i>), and the most austere cineaste should own this book.

He has written several volumes of poetry that have been performed live onstage by the Royal Shakespeare Company. He has homes in London, New York City, and the Caribbean island of Mustique.This is not your usual get-rich-quick manual. Though Dennis, a poet (<i>When Jack Sued Jill: Nursery Rhymes for Modern Times</i>) and the founder of a publishing empire (including <i>Maxim</i> magazine), wants to help the reader rank at least among the lesser rich (equal to a net worth of $30 million&#x2013;$80 million by his definition), he isn't himself motivated by money. With his own fortune estimated at between $400 million and $900 million, he doesn't have to be. Instead, Dennis wants to demystify the money-getting process, and his straight-talking, honest advice makes a refreshing change in this oversaturated field. Using humorous examples from his own business life, Dennis's advice, from The Five Most Common Start-Up Errors to The Power of Focus, might sound like conventional fare, but delivered in his signature bawdy, British style, it's altogether more entertaining&#x2014;and more practical. Dennis highlights the right strategies and mindset to get readers their millions, but he won't air-brush his story or soften the bitter truth along the way.

He spent his formative years as a scholar in the city of Karakorum, learning languages and philosophies rather than the tactics of war.</p> <p> When the other lines of succession failed, Kublai's older brother Mongke rose to lead the empire, a man who aimed to be another Genghis--traditional and utterly ruthless. Mongke began his reign with a great slaughter and put his followers and family in positions of power. Yet what was Mongke to do with his brother Kublai, the ink-stained scholar who had never left the city? Kublai dressed like a noble and had no experience of large-scale assaults. Astonishingly, Mongke sent his academic brother to conquer the hardest military target of the era--China. He gave Kublai an army of a hundred thousand, but at that time, a single Chinese city contained more people than the entire Mongol nation. The Emperor of China was capable of putting two million trained soldiers in the field. It was an impossible task, a perfect example of "asymmetric warfare," where a much smaller side is forced to innovate to survive.</p> <p> Given an impossible task, what happened was an extraordinary leap of imagination for a man of the thirteenth century. Kublai learned the tactics of cavalry archers. He learned how to use cannons and what a burden they would prove to a fast cavalry force. He had good generals and his men were the elite horsemen of the Great Khan, but that would not have been enough on its own. What Kublai discovered was the exact opposite of Genghis's chief tactic. Genghis had destroyed cities as an example, so that the next ones would surrender without a fight. Kublai <em>spared</em> cities, allowing them to remain untouched as his army swept by. Once his mercy was a proven fact, they surrendered by the dozen. Armies sent against him knew they could lay down weapons and live.</p> <p> By the time Mongke rode out with a huge army to "save" his brother, Kublai was in strike range of the enemy capital. Perhaps Mongke would have taken the glory, but he died on the trip south and Kublai was left in sole command. He wanted to go on, but news came that his youngest brother had declared himself Khan at home. Furious, Kublai broke off his campaign and returned to fight a civil war.</p> His life is the story of a scholar who was forced to lead first armies and then an empire. He turned out to be better at it than his brothers or Genghis. There were tragedies and glories still to come--the death of his wife and son, the failures against Japan and the splendid court described by Marco Polo. Kublai would lose more than he gained as the Great Khan of the empire, but he founded a Chinese dynasty and is remembered there with respect and honor.<b>Conn Iggulden</b> is the author of four novels in the saga of the Khan Dynasty&#x2014;<i>Genghis: Birth of an Empire; Genghis: Lords of the Bow; Genghis: Bones of the Hills;</i> and <i>Khan: Empire of Silver</i>&#x2014;as well as the Emperor novels, which chronicle the life of Julius Caesar.

The whole town is involved, and even Hannah's mother, who usually spends her time trying to get Hannah married, has found a new interest in recreating the home of one of Lake Eden's founding fathers. Connie MacIntyre, bestselling cook book author and star of a popular cable TV cooking show, has agreed to make the cake for the carnival banquet.

In the depths of the Great Depression it became a symbol of American resilience and ingenuity in the face of crisis, putting thousands of men to work in a remote desert canyon and bringing unruly nature to heel. <br><br>Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning writer Michael Hiltzik uses the saga of the dam&#x2019;s conception, design, and construction to tell the broader story of America&#x2019;s efforts to come to grips with titanic social, economic, and natural forces. For embodied in the dam&#x2019;s striking machine-age form is the fundamental transformation the Depression wrought in the nation&#x2019;s very culture&#x2014;the shift from the concept of rugged individualism rooted in the frontier days of the nineteenth century to the principle of shared enterprise and communal support that would build the America we know today. In the process, the unprecedented effort to corral the raging Colorado River evolved from a regional construction project launched by a Republican president into the New Deal&#x2019;s outstanding&#x2014;and enduring&#x2014;symbol of national pride. <br><br>Yet the story of Hoover Dam has a darker side. Its construction was a gargantuan engineering feat achieved at great human cost, its progress marred by the abuse of a desperate labor force. The water and power it made available spurred the development of such great western metropolises as Los Angeles, Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, and San Diego, but the vision of unlimited growth held dear by its designers and builders is fast turning into a mirage. <br><br>In Hiltzik&#x2019;s hands, the players in this epic historical tale spring vividly to life: President Theodore Roosevelt, who conceived the project; William Mulholland, Southern California&#x2019;s great builder of water works, who urged the dam upon a reluctant Congress; Herbert Hoover, who gave the dam his name though he initially opposed its construction; Frank Crowe, the dam&#x2019;s renowned master builder, who pushed his men mercilessly to raise the beautiful concrete rampart in an inhospitable desert gorge. Finally there is Franklin Roosevelt, who presided over the ultimate completion of the project and claimed the credit for it. Hiltzik combines exhaustive research, trenchant observation, and unforgettable storytelling to shed new light on a major turning point of twentieth-century history.</p><p>Michael Hiltzik is a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning journalist and author who has covered business, technology, and public policy for&nbsp;the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> for three decades.

It does not rank as the longest river in North America, nor the widest, nor the most abundant. Its drainage basin of a quarter-million square miles barely falls within the ten largest in the United States, and much of it covers inaccessible range or desolate wasteland. Unlike the Mississippi, Hudson, and St. Lawrence, to name three great riparian thoroughfares of the continent, the Colorado has never been a significant bearer of commercial traffic.<br> <br>Throughout history, what has set the Colorado River apart from all other waterways of the Western Hemisphere is its violent personality. The Colorado has always been best known for the scars it left on the landscape, among them the greatest of all natural works, the Grand Canyon, a testament to the river&#x2019;s primordial origin and its compulsive energy. No river equaled its maniacal zeal for carving away the terrain in its path and carrying it downstream, sometimes as far as a thousand miles. No river matched its schizophrenic moods, which could swing in the course of a few hours from that of a meandering country stream to an insane torrent.<br> <br>It is hardly surprising that from ancient times, the humans who coexisted with the Colorado depicted it not as a beneficent life-giving force but as a fiery red monster, a dragon or serpent beyond man&#x2019;s ability to tame.<br> <br>The basin&#x2019;s first recorded inhabitants, the native tribespeople of the southern plains, had no option but to accommodate themselves to the river&#x2019;s implacable temperament. They pastured their livestock on the grass that sprang up in the wake of its floods, planted crops on its rich alluvial deposits, imagined their gods and spirits housed within its labyrinthine canyons, assembled their myths and legends from the raw material of its natural mystery.<br> <br>The American settlers of a later era, driven by the demands of commerce and dreams of wealth, were not so inclined to defer to nature&#x2019;s unpredictable willfulness. From their earliest encounters with the river, they pondered how to corral it, divert it, drain it, and consume it. The California engineer Joseph Barlow Lippincott, dispatched to the river by the city of Los Angeles in 1912, pronounced it &#x201c;an American Nile awaiting regulation&#x201d;&#x2014;to be best treated &#x201c;in as intelligent and vigorous a manner as the British government has treated its great Egyptian prototype.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lippincott&#x2019;s judgment reflected a new conservation policy then taking root in the United States. It was based on defining conservation not as protection or preservation but as exploitation. Woodrow Wilson&#x2019;s interior secretary, Franklin K. Lane, laid out the new approach with striking directness. &#x201c;Every tree is a challenge to us, and every pool of water and every foot of soil,&#x201d; he proclaimed. &#x201c;The mountains are our enemies. We must pierce them and make them serve. The sinful rivers we must curb.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lane&#x2019;s successors answered his call to arms. Over the following decades, the U.S. government carried out an ambitious program to harness the sinful Colorado, working the river until the volume remaining to trickle into the sea scarcely merited an asterisk on a hydrological graph. The architects of this program couched their intentions in moral terms, as though they were not altering the natural order but restoring the watershed to a state of grace. &#x201c;The Colorado River flows uselessly past the international desert which Nature intended for its bride,&#x201d; wrote William Ellsworth Smythe, the most prominent water evangelist of his era, in 1900. &#x201c;Some time the wedding of the waters to the soil will be celebrated, and the child of that union will be a new civilization.&#x201d;<br> <br>What first lured Europeans to the banks of the Colorado, however, was not its potential to nurture crops. It was gold. Or, more precisely, the mirage of gold.<br> <br>The Spanish conquistadors, led by Hern�n Cortes and Francisco Pizarro, had completed their plunder of the Inca and Aztec empires of the New World before the sixteenth century was three decades old. They had looted the Indians&#x2019; storehouses, exhausted their mines, and worked legions of slaves to death. Yet their appetite for gold, silver, and gemstones remained unquenched.<br> <br>Fortuitously, hints of new treasures soon emerged from the uncharted north, reenergizing the Spanish quest. In the mid-1530s, adventurers returned from Indian imprisonment in the Sonoran Desert&#x2014;present-day New Mexico and Arizona&#x2014;laden with news of a land called Cibola, where stood seven magnificent cities in which (according to the yarn one traveler spun for his relatives) &#x201c;the women wore strands of gold and the men golden waistbands&#x201d; and the palace walls were encrusted with emeralds.<br> <br>Lured by this vision of wealth, the conquistadors probed along the Sea of Cortez (the Gulf of California) until they encountered, inevitably, the Colorado delta. The first advance parties were driven back by the ferocious tides at the confluence of the river and gulf. Finally, in 1539, a ship under the tenacious command of Captain Hernando de Alarc�n managed to sail upriver about 150 miles, penetrating well into Sonora. He was shortly followed by an immense force under the command of General Francisco V�squez de Coronado, dispatched to explore the beckoning golden empire by land.<br> <br>Coronado&#x2019;s scouts were soon filling in the blank maps of the Southwest. They renamed the Colorado the Rio del Tison, or Firebrand River&#x2014;not because of its willfulness, but for the torches the local Indians bore on their travels&#x2014;and they came upon the Grand Canyon, reporting the immense natural formation with appropriate wonderment.<br> <br>But their quest for gold failed. A pueblo city that scouts had described as ringed with gilded ramparts proved to be built of mere mud and clay, which happened to glimmer deceptively in the setting sun. The other majestic cities of Cibola remained as elusive as phantasms. For two more years<br> <br>Coronado searched for gold, finally returning home empty-handed and deeply in debt.<br> <br>Yet there was gold in the north, just not where he had been looking for it. Another three centuries would pass before its discovery would attract white Americans in great numbers back to what had long since been written off as a hopelessly unprepossessing territory. The Gold Rush of 1849 would draw ninety thousand fortune seekers, known as Forty-niners or Argonauts, to ford the Colorado River&#x2014;part of a migration of men, women, and families that has been called &#x201c;the largest single western movement in the nation&#x2019;s history.&#x201d;<br> <br>The frenzy began with an unassuming item on an inside page of the <i>San Francisco Californian</i> of March 15, 1848, headlined, &#x201c;GOLD MINE FOUND.&#x201d; It did not fully take root in the national consciousness until nine months later, when President James K. Polk gave the federal government&#x2019;s imprimatur to the discovery at Sutter&#x2019;s Mill. As an expansionist, Polk made no effort to downplay a discovery likely to encourage new settlement in an underpopulated region. Instead, he reported in his annual message to Congress on December 5 that &#x201c;the explorations already made warrant the belief that the supply is very large.&#x201d;<br> <br>Some 300,000 Argonauts struck out for the West, a third of them taking what became known as the southern routes&#x2014;overland byways converging at Yuma, Arizona, where the Gila River joined the Colorado, and continuing along one or another waterless trail, or jornada, toward the Pacific coast. These trails acquired a vicious reputation. One in particular, a desert crossing paralleling the Rio Grande in New Mexico, bore a label that presently was applied to the entire unspeakably harsh road west. It was known in Spanish as <i>la jornada de la muerte;</i> in English as &#x201c;the journey of death.&#x201d;<br> <br>Perils of every variety confronted travelers on the jornada: disease, brigands, hostile tribes, and the daunting terrain itself. Not even the best-out-fitted expeditions were immune. This was shown by the dire experience of John Woodhouse Audubon, the renowned naturalist&#x2019;s younger son, who left New York for the Texas coast and points west with a party of eighty, backed by what was regarded as lavish capital of $27,000.<br> <br>On the day of his departure, Audubon was a youthful thirty-six, &#x201c;tall, strong and alert,&#x201d; in the words of his daughter Maria. When he returned home a year later he was broken, &#x201c;worn out in body and spirit&#x201d; by his travails on the Jornada and the loss at sea of all his sketches and most of his notebooks.<br> <br>The first blow to strike Audubon&#x2019;s company had been cholera, which killed five members within days of their landing in Texas and reduced a dozen others to dehydrated wraiths. The survivors pressed on, Audubon collecting botanical specimens and sketching wildlife in his father&#x2019;s style. In mid-October he and his remaining companions reached the junction of the Gila and the Colorado, which he dismissed as merely a &#x201c;muddy stream.&#x201d; Crossing to the opposite bank and clambering up a sand dune, he perceived a further omen of the dismal prospects facing the expedition. He was perched upon a desert ridge that belonged to the &#x201c;walking hills&#x201d; of California, a natural barrier that would obstruct men&#x2019;s activities in the region for the next half-century. &#x201c;There was not a tree to be seen, nor the least sign of vegetation, and the sun pouring down on us made our journey seem twice the length it really was.&#x201d;<br> <br>The next day Audubon&#x2019;s group came upon a chain of fetid lagoons, where they deduced the fate of their numberless predecessors from the detritus scattered on the ground. &#x201c;Truly here was a scene of desolation,&#x201d; he wrote.<br> <br>Broken wagons, dead shriveled up cattle, horses and mules as well, lay baking in the sun, around the dried-up wells that had been opened, in the hopes of getting water. Not a blade of grass or green thing of any kind relieved the monotony of the parched, ash-colored earth, and the most melancholy scene presented itself that I have seen since I left the Rio Grande.<br> <br>They could hardly have suspected, slogging through the vacant wastes and slaking their thirst from pools of water described by a fellow traveler as &#x201c;a tincture of bluelick, iodides of sulphur, Epsom salts, and a strong decoction of decomposed mule flesh,&#x201d; that they were crossing the grounds of a future paradise. The introduction of fresh water to the Imperial Valley and the dam that would impound it lay decades in the future. But the Argonauts&#x2019; journeys marked a vital step in the process. The Gold Rush awoke official Washington to the military and economic significance of America&#x2019;s western territories and to the necessity of acquiring firsthand testimony about what lay between the frontier and the Pacific coast.<br> <br>One of the prime movers of what became known as the Great Reconnaissance was President Franklin Pierce&#x2019;s secretary of war, Jefferson Davis.<br> <br>The desert held a peculiar fascination for Jeff Davis. As a U.S. senator, he had risked public ridicule by proposing to deploy camels in the Southwest as a military experiment. Upon joining the cabinet in 1853, he put his plan into action by importing fifty of the animals for his department, but the program collapsed four years later, following his and President Pierce&#x2019;s departure from power.<br> <br>A more enduring mark was left by the survey Davis commissioned to identify a Southwestern route for an intercontinental railroad. The reports from his five survey parties later published in twelve majestic volumes-America&#x2019;s most important exploratory record since Lewis and Clark&#x2014;contained a wealth of information about the vast region&#x2019;s topography, geology, wildlife, and natural history.<br> <br>Attached to the survey was William Phipps Blake, a young geologist from a prominent Eastern family. Blake&#x2019;s party failed to discern a suitable railroad route, but he did stumble upon a remarkable geologic feature in the trackless desert. His first clue that he had found something extraordinary came on November 17, 1853, when from the edge of a windswept ridge in the San Bernardino Mountains (not far from the site of modern Palm Springs) he noticed &#x201c;a discoloration of the rocks extending for a long distance in a horizontal line on the side of the mountains.&#x201d;<br> <br>With great excitement, Blake worked his way down the gradient. From the valley floor the line &#x201c;could be traced along the mountain sides, following all the angles and sinuosities of the ridges for many miles&#x2014;always preserving its horizontality&#x2014;sometimes being high up above the plain, and again intersecting long and high slopes of gravel and sand; on such places a beach-line could be read.&#x201d;<br> <br>The conclusion was inescapable: he was standing in the dry bed of an immense ancient sea, and the white line was its high water mark.<br> <br>Blake named the sea Lake Cohuilla, after the local Indian tribe. The white deposit, he determined, was composed of the fossilized shells of freshwater animals. His barometer told him that his location measured at least one hundred feet below sea level. From the Indians he learned that the valley served as the traditional locus of their own flood legend, &#x201c;a tradition they have of a great water (agua grande) which covered the whole valley and was filled with fine fish. . . . Their fathers lived in the mountains and used to come down to the lake to fish and hunt. The water gradually subsided &#x2018;poco,&#x2019; &#x2018;poco,&#x2019; (little by little,) and their villages were moved down from the mountains, into the valley it had left. They also said that the waters once returned very suddenly and overwhelmed many of their people and drove the rest back to the mountains.&#x201d;<br> <br>The desert was shaped like an oblong bowl rising from a central depression, or &#x201c;sink,&#x201d; about one hundred miles west of the Colorado River and deeper at its lowest point than Death Valley. The region&#x2019;s rainfall of less than three inches a year, the continent&#x2019;s most meager, had created over the eons a terrain as empty as the Arabian wastes. Where there was any vegetation at all, it was of the lowliest variety, resinous greasewood and creosote whose roots clung like talons to the sun-hardened earth.<br> <br>Yet Blake was not fooled by the apparent lifelessness of the cracked and sere clay veneer. &#x201c;The alluvial soil of the Desert is capable of sustaining a vigorous vegetation,&#x201d; he reported. &#x201c;If a supply of water could be obtained for irrigation, it is probable that the greater part of the Desert could be made to yield crops of almost any kind.&#x201d;<br> <br>The desert was in fact a deposit of rich soil eroded by the Colorado River from the basin upstream and transported south at the rate of 160 million tons a year. Working on millennial time, the silt filled in the shallow headwaters of the Gulf of California, shifting its shore 150 miles southward. This process turned the gulf&#x2019;s northernmost arm into the landlocked lake later known as the Salton Sea. As the lake slowly evaporated, it left behind a crust of mineral salt and calcified shells, the remnants of which Blake had spotted.<br> <br>Meanwhile, the river built up its bed with its own silt deposits year after year, like a train laying its own tracks. Eventually the river would be flowing within parallel levees elevated high above the desert floor. In time the levees would become unstable, their walls would collapse, and the stream, freed of its constraints, would inundate the desert basin, recharging the inland sea. Centuries would pass, a new accumulation of silt would stopper the errant flow, and the river would return to its old delta, resuming its journey to the gulf. Again the sea would evaporate, again the river would build up and tear down its levees, and again the sea would fill up, in a never-ending cycle.<br> <br>How many such oscillations took place over the ag...</p><h2>The Classic Tales of Brer Rabbit: From the Collected Stories of Joel Chandler Harris</h2><p>Seven playful folktales follow the adventures of the crafty Brer Rabbit, the wily Brer Fox, and the dumbfounded Brer Bear, introducing young readers to the original humor and wisdom of traditional African lore.</p><p></p><h2>The Man Who Loved Books Too Much: The True Story of a Thief, a Detective, and a World of Literary Obsession</h2><p><b>In the tradition of <i>The Orchid Thief</i>, a compelling narrative set within the strange and genteel world of rare-book collecting: the true story of an infamous book thief, his victims, and the man determined to catch him.</b><br><br> Rare-book theft is even more widespread than fine-art theft.
